I took the phone to Verizon and had it activated and was told it is refurbished and not new as listed. They offered to refund my money but it would leave me without a phone so Im stuck with a piece of crap. It shuts off a lot and has an image burned on the screen. Highly highly disappointed.,OK
"There were pictures of more accessories then were provided. The company was reasonable to work with for a return but did take a restocking fee for an item that was not opened. I received the item second hand as the protective coverings had paper stuck to it, appearing that it had been removed and re-applied. Overall not an aweful interaction, but I was hoping for more.",OK
"EL TELEFONO ESTA MUY BIEN, TRAJO TODOS SUS ACCESORIOS LO Ì_NICO MALO FUE LA BATERÌA, LA CUAL LLEGO DAÌÔADA, VINO LIBERADO PARA TODAS LAS OPERADORAS DE VENEZUELA.",OK
"FAIR WARNING IF YOU ARE A T-Mobile Customer..The phone works just fine on T-Mobile, but TEXTING DOES NOT. A workaround is to slow it down to 2G however, you still CANNOT send photos or music files. And, by slowing it down, guess what ? Internet response is at a snail's pace, so you have to change the setting to LTE.Yes I sent my concerns to Nokia through an app provided wit the phone. NO RESPONSE.Yes I have contacted T-Mobile support and they are clueless. I researched the issue myself (easy to Google) and found my own workaround. NO RESPONSE from T-Mobile as of this date.No one knows how to permanently solve the issue and neither Nokia nor T-mobile care.",OK
"The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand.",OK
I chose 3 stars because they are new but both iphones does not have a headphone. Would be very good if they were.,OK
"It's an ok phone, good features, but freezes quite often. Battery compartment seems not secure. I ordered this from the seller ""Phone Max"", and will never purchase anything from them. My phone started freezing up - wouldn't even turn on for factory reset until I take the battery out - after weeks of use, and the seller gave me a new battery assuming that its a battery issue. That didn't fix the problem. When I contacted them again the response was that the warranty time has expired, so no refund is possible. I think this seller is trying to get rid of some defective phones they have cheating people like me. So buyers be aware, it may look bit cheaper than other sellers, but avoid ""Phone Max"" or you will be repenting later. Terrible service from the seller.Vincents",OK
"I have had several of this model phone, this one shuts down when it feels like it and it takes fuzzy pics. I have never had that problem with any of my other phones that were just like it. Very Disappointed! ! !",OK
Watch looked great..but the band broke 1 week after wearing it..The watch itself is really cool though.,OK
Needed a replacement phone without paying the in store price. The phone looked great and had a good price. Delivered in a decent amount of time and was in very good physical condition when inspected. Everything was great until 6 days later one of the keys fell off the keyboard. Apparently I am not the only one who has had this issue. It concerns me that this is an ongoing problem with the people who supply these rebuilds and they have done nothing to address it.I have asked about getting the phone fixed. They required that I return the phone and then they will send a replacement OR repair the existing phone. Which ever is the cheaper option for them. Also you have not phone and no way to directly transfer data between the old phone and the newly received one. In my humble opinion this is bad business but as long as they keep selling phones they will keep up the same practices.,OK
I didn't find options to use 3G. It only gives option to use either 2G only. which are WCDMA or GSM. So the internet is very slow when wifi is not available.Other than this - the screen is good. camera is ok. A little bit slow. Anyway $200 should be good deal.,OK
"I looked and looked for an S4 Mini that was NOT the international version. Guess what I got? You guessed it, a phone that was all in Italian with a European power plug adapter. So far everything has worked fine except for the AT&T visual voice mail app. Battery life is also pretty crappy.",OK
"I got this to hold me over for a few months after my contract phone died and I waited for iPhone 6. And I love it so much I seriously thought of sticking with it, iPhone ischmone. But three key problems are sending me into the arms of Empire Apple. A little scrutiny at the screen and you can see the pixels, the camera is soo slow and handles light and color sloppily in the final picture, and the external speaker is like a little toy to play with instead of a grownup speaker, tinny and weak. But $220 and no contract for the 32gb universal model? Fuggedaboudit, I loooove this little phone!! I will weep when I have to let it go for the new iPhone.",OK
"Well, the last one I ordered died after about 1 year when it was in a pocket of my bag. I believe it overheated. Never did recover all of my data.",OK
I like the phone. Only problem is the phone doesn't keep a charger at all. I think it's a factory fault because I bought a certified refurbished one and it works as expected. I like the fact that this phone is Windows 10 Mobile upgradable.,OK
"The phone works great, but it came with the worst charger ever, so I traded chargers with a friend. The Nexus 5X also had an issue where it failed to update automatically, it would hang on reboot, so I had to plug it into a computer to load the ROM on manually. It wasn't hard, but if you are not a technical user, go buy the phone from someone else.",OK
"This phone is ok. I found it extremely difficult to set up. Once the service was turned on, it knocked out the wifi and would not connect. After 5 hours of research, I found that once the service is activated one must put it in airplane mode-- turn it off and reboot while still in the airplane mode. Once the phone has rebooted, turn off the airplane mode and turn on wifi and then it will work. Setting up the text messages was difficult as well. I could receive text messages but could not send or receive pictures using text. I am disappointed in the sound. The voice is very chintzy sounding. The BEAT service does not work unless an external speaker or headphones are used. When talking on the phone, the voice rattles and it gets very annoying. I also find that it overheats very often. I mean it gets REALLY HOT so I had to add a cooler to my phone. However, on the up side of things, there are many great features on this phone.",OK
The phones power button broke the second day we had the phone. But they did take it back. I thought they had good customer service.,OK
"I returned this because it would not recognize sandisk memory card. Without a memory card, one can not install pictures, games, etc",OK
"I was a little surprised to find out they still made basic touch pad phones. I solely purchased this phone for my father because he was having a hard time with a smart phone so I figured this would be a lot more easier. I would have given this item 5 stars but there was one area that I thought was lacking and that is there is no volume rocker on the side of the phone. You have to go into the settings and have to manually adjust the volume every time you want a lower/higher volume. The phone is quite small but I was aware of that when I did a little bit of research on the phone. I decided to enroll with simple mobile and the call quality was very clear. If your looking for a basic phone and don't mind not having a volume rocker than this phone is perfect for calls. If your a little more text savy than I'd say shop around a little more because texting on this phone is very frustrating. But overall, not that bad for a basic phone.",OK
"Phone showed up on schedule, and even had a battery! So I was happy about that!Could NOT activate initially as the tracker ball would NOT scroll. Had to replace the tracker ball from my old phone! Then it ""worked"". Verizon told me it was NOT a Verizon ID # LOL. Finally got it activated. Took long time to get email as it kept trying to populate Blackberry email. WTF? Transferred media with my SIM card, but NO Contacts transferred yet using my original Vodaphone card and SIM cards. What a mess... waiting for other shoe to drop. Very disappointed over all.",OK
I looked up the web site and had great difficulty locating this model. I have yet to locate instructions for use such as : Where is the keypad for the telephone? It show 3 choices: Language: English; accessories for the disabled; and an emergency dialing pad that will not accept any number.This is extremely frustrating.,OK
The phone was good to activate as advertised but the battery really did suckin trying to hold a charge for more than one day with very little use.,OK
Got this for my husband for Vday thought it was the Samsung one he wanted but it's NOT he still like this one tho,OK
"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone.",OK
It's pretty good but be careful when using the entry points for the charger and the headphones as they are held on with less material and might rip off.,OK
I brought this for my wife because she wanted to start texting more. Problem with this phone is the keyboard was too small for her to use so I returned it. Return it was not a problem. The company gave a prompt refund without a hassle. I did like this aspect.,OK
I bought it to replace my old phone. it works ok but I would prefer one that lets you put your mp3 ringtones on there to set as a ringtone but it doesn't show after you stick them on the phone. but other then that its ok phone.,OK
Is it refurbished?: Yes. Is it certified? I don't believe so. The home button is not a smooth as my other iPhone's home button. It is a small or big annoyance depending what were you expecting for. But from there everything is as you expected with an Apple iPhone.,OK
"I know how old I am ""73"" but I do have trouble without some kind of hard copy that I can hold and read to know just what I am doing with this phone. I can not get the phone to just ring and it drives me nuts when it goes off.thank you, Mrs Ann Smutko",OK
"Volume and Power Switches on the right side are cheap plastic design, built into rear battery cover. When I removed the battery cover to insert Sim Card and MicroSD Card, the Power Switch button was detached from the cover. I had to struggle to install it back. I am afraid that the next time when I remove the cover to replace Sim or MicroSD Card, the buttons might break off completely. Then, I will have to buy a new battery cover. Touch screen is not sensitive enough. Virtual key board is too slow to touch.",OK
"It's okay. It occasionally rejects calls , why I have no idea. I am incredibly disappointed with how slow it is but that is my fault for only buying 16 bit.",OK
"you get what you pay for. not having a front camera sucks. hard to text, the keypad doesnt work as well as a galaxy or iphone. back camera isnt that great. headphones that it comes with are junk. screen size is nice, good visuals, all in all a decent cheap phone. would not recommend, but would mention to anyone looking to buy a cheap replacement.",OK
"Phone was not in working condition. Version was unable to activate the phone under my number, because it was still active under another account. The company said they could not fix the problem because they did not have the information of the previous owner. They should have thought that through before they sold the phone.",OK
"Phone works great but has problem with heat compared to Samsung S5 or S6 that I own. At 25-50% light display is not bad but 100% light display on screen causes the phone to be really, really warm. Putting it into any case causes increase heating. If not the need for dual sim (low cost phone), I would go with the new S7 next time.",OK
I like the phone only problem with it is u have to upgrade it for some apps an it wont even upgrade it,OK
"The phone itself seems to be ok, but right out of the box it wiped our sim card - actually destroying it and making the data unreadable. I had bought this for my son who is pretty hard on his phones and this looked like a good solution. Other reviewers had said that it worked fine right out of the box. What we have found is the reception is pretty bad - not like others had said. But it is a prepaid phone that we are trying to use as a paid for phone, so there is that. It is just so surprising that the US does not offer good, cheap phones and affordable cell phone service. In El Salvador, you can get a sweet prepaid phone for $11 and recharge it for less than a $1 depending on the deals they have going on. Yes, that is $1 for 30 minutes of long distance to the US. All in all, I would not buy this phone again.",OK
Phone wasn't unlocked as described and the keypad doesn't work when on a call so I cannot input selections while on automatied calls.,OK
"Purchase new iPhone 4 32GB according advertisement, but once open, missing headset and media book.If new item, it must have adepter, USB charger, headset, and media book kit.",OK
"moisture and water has gotten under both layers of this case numerous times, even if I just didn't try hands completely after doing dishes or washing hands. It is frustrating because the one for the iphone 4s was great and I never had moisture get it. This is for the 5s one. I like everything else about it but this.",OK
"This was a basic touch sreen phone. like I SAID BASIC FOR BASIC REASON. IT WORKS JUST FOR WHAT U NEED. I TRAVELLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY YEARLY SO, I USE IT FOR THAT PURPOSE ONLY. ITS WORKS JUST FINE FOR THAT.",OK
"Good basic phone, no web access, no MMS texting. But has really held up to multiple drops and such. Very basic. Good reception.",OK
"I don't think the phone was brand new as advertised, since the battery cover would open without something THIN to insert at the LATCH END to open the BATTERY COMPARTMENT!",OK
I got it but the cable is not from apple and is Blue color also the cable has cut,OK
"I had to buy the D821 model in order to make sure it will works in Brazil.Sometimes the camera focus just stop working, everything is blurred despite the camera app saying it's ok. OS is version 4.4.2 (so theoretically the previous camera bug is fixed), restarting the device and tried other camera apps but the problems persists. It can stay in this state for hours. My hope is to be a software problem.Previously I've owned a Nexus S and a Galaxy Nexus and never had any problem with these.Otherwise the device is good, screen is big and have nice colors, very fast. Battery life is par with my previous Galaxy.",OK
"I had one of these phones for a year and a half. On a road trip, I tried to sinc the phone with the leased portable Garmin that came with a rental car. I believe someone had a virus or something on the Garmin. It made my touch screen freeze up, rendering the phone pretty much inoperable. Since I am on a fixed budget...I decided to order another phone just like it. It came in great condition and within 5 days from placing my order. It works great. This is no smartphone, but for just phone calls and texting it is great. You can check your email with it, but the screen is small so it is hard to do much online. Could be used in a pinch. Dont buy this phone if you are using it to go online, you will be disappointed. However, if you just use it for calls and texting, it is a great little phone.",OK
"The phone is OK but though it says unlocked, it has all the ATT stuff on it and would be very irritating using it on another network.",OK
Cool watch for the price..didn't receive the micro usb to headphone jack to plug headphones in for fm radio..But does connect Bluetooth to Bluetooth headphones for audio and video..great inside ..outside kinda cuts in and out if running.I could get it to sink with my phone but notifications like fb or other programs would not transfer to watch only calls and text..overall built strong good band...solid case ...cool for a gagetWish they would send that adapter plug thoughMicro usb to headphone jack and would give another star ....:),OK
"Rubber casing at the bottom of the phone is loose. It is not a tight fit. I ordered it because I loved the colors and the price was pretty good but it bugs me that the plastic racing and the rubber are not in tact at the bottom. That's how bad it is. Color scheme does look nice, especially on my space grey iPhone se but build... _ÙÔ_",OK
"It is a good device with the price. The function is so so.When I received the cell phone, the keyboard makes zizi noise. After had been used for a couple of days, the noise disappeared, but came out again and again. Finally, I decided to return it.The cell phone does not have WIFI. When the siginal is not good enough, you cannot visit internet. And there is only one clock. Therefore, you have to set clock if you want alarm at different time.If I talk on the phone for a long while, the phone becomes a little hot. And the battery can last for 4 hours instead of 8 hours mentioned by NOKIA. If you have a lot of calls, you have to consider it.The camera is not good. The picture is not clear due to 3.2 MP.",OK
"The Good and Bad of this deal.....It was advertised as an Apple 2 watch, it is not....that's the bad, and a big one. The good, even as a Series 1 watch, it is brand new, not used or refurbished, and stainless steel version with sapphire crystal display that you cannot purchase any longer from Apple for the Series 1...only now offered for Series 2. So for under $270, still not a bad deal, I would say just okay, but not as great as I thought when I ordered it. Purchased as a Christmas gift, so I will let her decide if we should return...but I'm guessing that's what will happen.",OK
"Didnt get 4GLTE instead it has H+ white it turns out is just as fast, other 5han that I love this phone",OK
"El telÌ©fono no puede entrar en servicio porque me pide numero de PIN, favor ver para desbloquearMe gusto por que es rapido y tiene muchos accesorios",OK
"This cell phone is just ok. Really. It has a reasonable amount of the features most smart phones has. It does not have a good camera or flash. The keyboard worn out after three months. But the worst is having to deal with NOKIA customer service. I had such a bad experience, which contrasts so much with the experience I had with Nokia customer service in Europe.",OK
"good phone , but over time it's slow is no longer Highly Recommended This option",OK
"I recieved my phone and it came in a cushioned envelope the phone could've been broken. I emailed their customer service representives to inquire about the phone, because I was unable to use the data plan for the phone. I received a email that said and I quote ""Hello, This phone is unlocked already you may have to get an updated sim from your carrier in order for all functions to work. Please send me a return request if you would still like to return the phone. Best Regards, Tech Addicts. "" No other help I'm sure this isn't the first time that this has happened and why wouldn't I have a new SIM card. Well the answer was to download a program called Network Setup (it's free) and run it and your phone should work perfectly. It can be found in the marketplace.",OK
"I bought this phone a couple of months ago and so far its okay, the only complaint I have right now is that I can't find a case at all for it.",OK
Just got my s5 mini. Not to ecstatic about this purchase. I bought phone as new but as soon as I got my package it was obvious this was a used phone. Had already been set in another language with some newly installed apps. Phone also lags. I've reset the phone and now will be adjusting to it,OK
"I expected more about this product, but the problem is that Android consumes a lot of resources that leave the phone stalled sometimes",OK
"Works good for the price. I am satisfied with the camera and screen quality. It has its problems-- the GPS crashes the phone, there is often a buzzing interference when using speaker and the battery life is not great. All in all for the price it is worth it.",OK
I had this cell for 3 years after getting it when it first came out. it was finally ending its days to use so i decided to get another and purchase it from amazon .... The cell worked fine for a day then It was freezing and won't txt correctly .. I have redid the calibration a hundred times no matter what I do the cell seems to ignore me trying to touch it. :(,OK
I purchased this phone until it was time for my upgrade. It freezes up quite often as well as shut down. If these issues didn't happen this phone would be perfect.,OK
Earphone Jack faulty tried many different earphones barely works with blue earphones.But you get what you pay for. It's an OK phone not bad.,OK
"I do not like because it only comes in English and Korean, Spanish no. Korea brings many applications, which tube to clear up space because not only useless to me. Should you place in that language comes to that one is aware.",OK
"Keeps a charge very well, and it lasts a few charges! I just don't like that it is bulky.",OK
"Excelent price for a biginner Android smart phone. Relatively low performance phone; not recomended for games or a large collection of apps, but is great for basic smartphone use: maps, WAZE, move it, facebook, whatsapp, google translate, Email, etc.One problem I've been having since I updated the OS is the phone will, about once or twice each week, reboot itself and the date and time will go back by a few days and some hours. If noticed right away it isn't much of a problem, but if gone unnoticed every SMS received will be taged with that date and time making it hard to find later.Otherwize a great phone for the price. Works great as a phone to take internationally because it will accept any SIM card and can be set to a large veriety of languages.",OK
"The phone, my first smart phone, worked fine for the first nearly two months I have owned it. Then it developed a known-to-Motorola 'connectivity' problem for which the Motorola site offered a fix. The fix did not work because it ironically required a connection to work! What a ridiculous fix for a phone that has no connection possibility. Numerous very time consuming calls to Motorola resolved the problem by their sending me another phone, presumably a new one that will not have this connectivity problem built in. I will have been without a phone for over two weeks by the time this is over. Bottom line, the customer service at Motorola is not at all user friendly. Were I to do this all over again, in spite of the good reviews this phone has, I would NOT buy it again. Motorola needs to up their game if they expect to be competitive in the phone market.",OK
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",OK
"Would have been five stars, but the battery life is rather awful. The processor speed is pretty slow and can get bogged down pretty easily. Just having snapchat up can kill the processor.",OK
Love this phone and have owned it before. The only thing I don't like is how difficult it is to turn on the T9 predictive text and how the qwerty keyboards keys are too smooth. Other than that it does what it needs to for the money you pay for it. But AT&T is getting rid of the 2G network in December so this phone will be obsolete.,OK
"It took two phones, numerous emails, several phone calls and a whole lot of patience to get an fully unlocked phone. It was suppose to be a christmas present and finally got a phone we could use on jan 5th. I just hope this phone last...",OK
"Phone had no service in my house and was very slow. I was issued a refund, so that's good, but it was a little bit of a hassle to get everything squared away.",OK
"Unfortunately, the phone has only worked for 2 months. It maybe a hardware problem, the phone only works in certain areas but not in my home. The WIFI doesn't work at all. I don't mind the scratches on the phone, I would just like a phone that works. I returned the phone today, let's hope there is a happy ending.",OK
"overall not bad but if you use the camera at all stay away from this phone you can not take a picture the is not blurred. I will not use it long, you get what you pay for.",OK
"Compared to iPhone, this phone is really difficult to use. Web browser doesn't support Asian languages. There is no firmware update to fix this problem.",OK
I bought this phone for my mom who is in her 50's. I thought it would be easy for her to manage texting because of the actual keyboard and simple other phone uses.....she liked it. However the phone screen went completely dead after less than 3 months of use. She could not access anything from the phone via the touch screen and some menu options were not accessible via the keys on the keyboard. I ended up buying her a new phone.,OK
"Would've been a great phone, but had a few dead spots in the touchscreen. I don't fancy have to repeatedly touch at a spot to get a response. Especially when typing!",OK
"I was very excited to get this phone, since it is my first smartphone. I had great expectations but got a little dissapointed on the 4th day of use when a notice starting showing up that said ""memory full"", or something like that. Immediatly went to find information about this on forums and it seems to be a problem for many nokia smartphones. Still, I went through all the recommendations and finally erased a few applications that came with the phone and the message stop showing up. I hope it doesn't return, since its probably a bug in the system. I didn't even started downloading stuff when it appear. I think its a good phone compared with its price.",OK
"Delivery was correct, but the version of software is not the newest and neither have the option to update; my boyfriend has the same model of another supplier and seems more advanced; I do not understand why.",OK
"It is a great phone. The build quality is amazing and rock solid. The OS is what it is. If you're in the 2.5% of people who use a Windows Phone, you know how amazing the OS is, but how terrible the app store content is.My only complaint with the phone is how easily it can bend. If you carry this thing around in your front pocket of your jeans, it will start to warp and cause ghost touch issues. My screen has started to come apart from the body of the phone, as well.",OK
"The only major problem I've had with this phone is that it freezes and sometimes it can be a pain to restart it. Then it takes a while for it to load all your data once you turn it back on. Besides that it's good. Not the best phone ever. If you text and surf the web a lot like I do and don't have a big budget for a smart phone, it's a good phone.",OK
"The face that the Blackberry was missing a lot of the apps that I have become accustomed to using on a day to day basis was disappointing. Sideloaded apps took to long to load (I know that it isnt its purpose). It's a solid phone, but it needs more support.",OK
"I got this with a warehouse deal for $139, at that price this is a great phone.The form factor is durable and attractive, but it is incredibly light. Antenna reception is good (at&t) The screen is not full HD, but the resolution difference is not that noticeable. The battery life is about a day and a half of moderate usage, and the stamina mode is impressive.Under light usage its very snappy and quick but under any kind of demand it boggs down. If I have 3+ tabs open in google chrome with queued videos it will start to freeze. Same goes for when multitasking demanding apps. (in my case torque and chrome).Further, it does not have a gyroscope so no google cardboard.There is also no screen activation without using the physical button (such as swipe up / double tapping the screen).As of 6/14 only android 5.0 officially.",OK
"It's and ok phone but can't find a good case for it. And after 3 weeks of owning it, I dropped it on the ground and that is the end of this phone. =(",OK
The phone was very limited and slow. I ended up buying something else. Good deal for the price.,OK
Home button was filthy I had to clean with alcohol wipe prior to setting up phone. Phone seems to be working well.,OK
For the price it's a decent phone. The dual sim capability is cool it's like having two phones in one. It is unlocked but pending where your location is will tell how the phone acts on the carrier. The not so good is the camera. Out of focus and dull. Not the best. Also it restarts out of the blue for some reason but for the price and what's all included it's not a bad phone. If you've got the patience for Windows 8 then go for it. Patience is a virtue with this phone,OK
"beware, this phone is gorgeous, has great battery life, but may not work well with your carrier network. do your research!",OK
"The cell phone was SIM locked for Uruguay (latam).I was expecting a factory unlocked, but wasn't.The seller give me the lock number for free, it was given from Samsung.I waste some days to unlock the phone, but today is all right.I recommend the cell phone!!",OK
"Bought the phone from the seller ""Mobile Deals"", works perfectly and it's an amazing device! HOWEVER it's not the factory unlocked i9505 version but the AT&T equivalent (SGH-i337) and that it's NOT advertised anywhere by the seller. Now I have to wait for AT&T to release their update in order for me to get at least JellyBean 4.3 and who knows when I'll get KitKat 4.4. The phone IS unlocked though (that much is true because I tested it with various Venezuelan SIM cards) but it's not what I expected (I would've given it 5 star if it was).",OK
"This cosmo LG phone I bought replaced my old cosmo LG phone (identical). I chose this phone on Amazon because it had the lowest cost, best rating, and highest quality description.I was happy to receive the phone in a reasonable amount of time (5 days + the weekend). But the product description ""very good condition"" was not fitting. I realize that it is a risk to buy a used phone off of amazon, because, hey, you never know.I feel the need to give feedback so future buyers can feel secure when buying off amazon.Having said that, I was disappointed with this product.The texting keys are finicky. For example, the keypad sometimes types d, and sometimes refuses to type d. Since I use the phone primarily for texting and calling, this is a bit frustrating. I would like the description of the phone to match the *actual* quality.thank you.",OK
screen shattered after falling out of jeans from height of 2 inches. menu buttons don't light up. stylus good. gps good.,OK
"item was received in good condition however battery was old, unused and not working well, only has a one day charge so I needed to order a new battery - from another vendor - description should indicate battery issue",OK
I purchased this just over a month ago so I could be added to a T-Mobile business plan through my job and it's worked wonderfully but it hasn't been able to read the SIM card for the past few days so now I have to do a trade-in with T-Mobile directly.,OK
This is a nice looking android phone! pleasantly surprised for the price. I love the BLU products. The battery life is amazing! But the 4GB internal storage is very disappointing:( I installed SD card which was fantastic. I was able to transfer most of my apps and all of my music/pictures to the card. To my disappointment not all downloaded apps can be transferred to an SD card. With only a few such apps installed I started getting pop ups that my internal storage was low. Why would BLU leave only a few hundred MB of free storage on the internal memory? Not impressed with that at all!,OK
Good phone but don't waste your money. This phone isn't water resistant and does not have expandable storage like the s7. Just get the s7 if you're willing to pay this much for the s6. Its practically the same price if you buy a used s7 in like-new or very good condition as I did. It's such a better deal that way. Plus the 7 is just all around a better phone.,OK
"This phone had high expectation from me, as I had researched it thoroughly. So I shot for it.... I got it and the Tray 1 Sim Reader didn't work. But I did try all the functions and was blown away...... I have giving it threes stars as I like it but for defunct equipment ... Returned for refund.",OK
"Came with battery, headphones and charger. Fast shipping. I've had it for about a week and zero issues so far. I'm extremely satisfied. If anything changes, I'll update my post......Update.After about a month this phone keeps freezing up and lagging out. Will contact to replace.",OK
"Purchased Unlocked version recently, using Lyca mobile sim which uses T-Mobile network; able to make call however mobile data is not working(Data roaming option is disabled by verizon). Phone is good but Verizon really pissed me off!, tried to contact customer service but no help.",OK
Was ok but did not last with my friend. I wish it lasted but never was this one. Very sad,OK
It is not LTE for USA. I was getting H only and had to return it. Otherwise I love the phone.,OK
"es un telefono basico con pantalla tactil, tiene lo necesario para las redes sociales como facebook, el video y las fotos de calidad aceptablescomo todos los nokia tiene un excelente sonido, tiene wifi, trae incluida una tarjeta de memoria de 2 gigas para almacenar canciones foto y video.el telefono viene en espaÌ±ol y otros 10 idiomas para escojer, y se puede actualizar todo el software desde ovi.asi que lo de version usa es solo por la garantia porque si algo pasa hay que devolverlo a eeuu.",OK
"a good android phone for cheap, enough said, does what is needed with only a few qwerks. i got it because of the price.",OK
the phone work pretty good but i have been having trouble keeping it charge fully got a new battery and it still not keeping a good charge but overall its a good phone,OK
"Didn't come with an SD Card, the Charm or the housing unit. It was listed as NEW so I expected it to come packaged as a new phone.The 3G does not work well. Overall disappointed with the phone.",OK
Wonderful cellphone is fast light and hard to damage but the camera doesn' perform at the level i was expecting but anything else is good android phone truly fast but low ram memory doesn't allow me to download to many apps but for the prize it is really good,OK
"COME ON! With a camera like that- like THAT Nokia, what the hell is the deal with a measly 32GB??? This phone rocks, rocks like a boss - OR WOULD rock like a boss if it had the storage capacity of the modern century. It's ridiculous, if you're an audiophile - like me! And a serious pro photographer - again like me! 32GB will go like yesterdays hot wings.Bottom line if you are like me and make a lot of pics and listen to a ton of photos, this phone can't handle it, not at 32GB. But if you don't have music and wouldn't bother making a lot of great photos with the amazing camera on this phone, then by all means buy it. It is a fantastic device.",OK
The phone works. The price was low. I just found out that the phone will not be upgraded to Windows 10 due to the low RAM and 4 gb of device storage. [...],OK
really heavy phone.. compared to my Samsung tablet.. it was big it didn't bother me but people always asking if I had a tablet or a phone so got tired of it... front camera was crappy back camera was good.. it wouldn't catch up when I was texting or the home button was on the screen so it was kind of annoying while texting it would bring me right back to the home page... love the color and the screen was hard... battery lasted a very long time.. worth the price kind of yes and no but I returned it before it got the 30 month gerent so now I ordered the blu vivo 5 I cant wait to receive it its amazing and that is worth its price.,OK
The camera isn't good at all but when it comes to doing what phone suppose to do it getting the job done,OK
"I am pleased with the phone except for one glitch. My list of contacts disappears frequently (every couple of days). Rebooting solves the problem most of the time (sometimes several reboots). This is frustrating. Unfortunately I've had the phone for six weeks, so it's too late to return it. I wish I had returned it faster for the same model to see if the problem happens with all of them or just mine. (If anyone else has had this problem and figured out how to solve it, please add a comment! Thanks.)",OK
I bought the phone as a new phone but it came with an open box - the original sticker was taken off as if the phone was refurbished.Meanwhile the phone worked with no problems.,OK
This phone was ordered for my husband. He loves this style and had one previous to ordering this one. Unfortunately we returned this one because it didn't work when we received it.,OK
This phone was alright but it is actually just too big I sent it back to get the Samsung S4 & am I ever glad I did. I would never give that phone up!,OK
"It looks like this is a common bug this phone has. I have tried to do some reasearch to fix it myself still without any luck. If the GPS werent as important as it is for me, I would five it five stars.",OK
These guys claimed it would work with T-mobile but for some reason I could not get LTE and tried calling LG and T mobile to try and fix the problem but nothing worked. Ended up returning the phone and getting a different one.,OK
"I purchased this phone to replace my mothers lost Verizon phone. She is currently in the middle of her two year contract, and didn't have insurance on her previous phone. This phone works as intended, and is easy for her to maneuver. It has basic functions (call, text, camera, and I believe. Web browser), and she is not at all tech savvy but has been able to use it with ease. A couple of times she's received weird prompts asking her to enter prepaid card information, but after resetting the phone, the prompts go away.",OK
Like the touch screen but the bb phones stick a lot. Not a phone I will buy again. Memory is not so good either...,OK
"The phone was a good price, arrived promptly and was packaged well. As a phone, it functions fine. Two things that drive me a little crazy: First, the camera is horrible. The photos are grainy and fuzzy. I thought 13 megapixels would produce clearer photos than my iPhone 4's 5 megapixels, but it does not. I can't deposit checks with my phone because the bank's app can not read the picture, it's too blurry. The other is when I'm typing a text or an email, I often hit the button on the bottom that brings you back to the main screen. I guess this is something I need to get used to.",OK
Can't hold the phone without hitting some app or something. Has buttons on side and all over the face. Try to put the phone away and I'm texting someone. Too complicated for a 75 year old starter.,OK
"It works well, seems as the screen was replaced because the brightness are clarity/quality is below the OEM, within 30 days of using it I had to factory reset once. This phone is ok for me as a place holder. The only thing that hasn't since I've received it is the dial tone when making selection during prompts, I it doesn't recognize the tone. I've reset the phone for this reason with the same results.",OK
"I like the phone but I had the predecessor and it had GPS, this model does not that I can see.",OK
It's only been 6 month. The screen developed a black dead spot. I have to start thinking about getting another phone. Disappointed!,OK
It's okay. The app is crap. I can't figure out how to get the SMS to work. Calls work fine. I'm still trying to figure some of the features out. You just get what you pay for.,OK
Not as user friendly as I would have hoped for. Requires too many taps to respond at times. Freezes up quite often and have to reboot in order to exit some menu options.,OK
I buy only Samsung products. I think in comparison to other very inexpensive phones they provide this one seems really slow when using apps. The basic phone functionality is fine though.,OK
"I choose this phone because I thought i was upgrading. I didn't like the screen, sometimes it wouldn't register the funciton i choose or wouldn't select the corect function. This item is good for someone that is trnasitioning to a smart phone and needs something simple. The system is a little slower than my ""my touch.""",OK
i think this phone does not meet the standards i was looking for in a smart phone even though i did not want to spend an arm and a leg for one. my first issue is that once you drop the phone even on a bed it turns off and restarts again. the least touch onto any hard surface and the phone restarts which is very inconvenient.,OK
"Though this is a very nice phone, it would not connect to a secured home wifi network, though all my other devices do. It did connect to unsecured wifi hot spots. I worked with Sony but they could not help resolve this issue. So I chalk it up to a software bug in their firmware. Even upgrading the Android software from Gingerbread to Ice Cream Sandwich did not help. I returned the device for credit. I gave it 3 stars since it is a nice phone but without access to my home wifi it is downgraded from what could be 4-5 stars.",OK
The phone I got was all good but on the box it said a book or cd was included with the phone but we did not get one.,OK
"I had read up on reviews of this phone for a while before I bought it and would have expected to still be on the high after all the recommendations to purchase, but I'm not.I have a couple of issues. The back button on the touchscreen is NOT WORKING WELL at all. I have to touch on the main screen first to ""activate"" the touch on the back button. At times it just does NOT work. I do not know if it is a flaw with the phone, and I am hoping the phone that I got is NOT a refurbished one because I asked for a NEW one. The other thing is the lack in ability to customise ringtones and message tones as I would like without having to do the whole run around installing apps to get around it.Other than that I like the phone.",OK
"It worked great for a little while. I dropped it a few times and the screen never cracked, but the LCD always messed up. I paid to get it fixed twice but when I dropped it a third time I decided not to waste anymore money on it. If you're not clumsy like me then the phone is great.",OK
"I've had this phone about a year. It's not horrible, but not great either. I guess it's not bad for the price. I don't make or receive calls that much (mostly texts), but the speaker is adequate. I use the music app with earbuds when I workout. Works fine. Biggest problem is the camera sucks big time. Always slightly blurry. I have to charge it every night. It gets down to 40% usually. You get what you pay for.",OK
"I bought this for my daughter. She likes it well enough for a basic phone. It works as it says. It's a bit weird to type with, small keyboard. Shipped fairly fast.",OK
I like this phone i just hate how there is not a lot of good cases for it and also only works on att and tmobile which sucks,OK
"The phone came just as I ordered, but the phone itself is disappointing. The battery dies within a few hours, even without use and it has a problem with over heating even with minimal usage.",OK
"Cheap and Cheerful, bit like a bicycle without a chain. I was just about to throw this $18 dollar unlocked backup out of the window with frustration because the entire menu is in Portuguese and it came with NO instructions (the leaflet included is anything but). It was Amazon's readers that saved it. Their instructions on HOW to change language to English, was like putting the chain on a cycle. The phone is now working nice and dandy and I now feel I got a bargain with a long life functional phone tucked away as I travel through Asia. Thank you Amazon Readers!",OK
I'm lucky if I get 5 hours out of a charge. Other than that is an average smart phone that gets the job done.,OK
"i had this for 11 months now. i live in Trinidad and it works well over the gsm network. Three problems i encountered. 1. the phone takes a long time to start up or reboot. 2. sometimes there is a lag in processing (opening a program or game). 3. even though the phone is working fine on top of the screen still says ""Activation Required"". my service provider says that is normal for verizon phones. but in all it is a stable product and the problems are minor and manageable.",OK
For a used phone I thought that it was in very good condition. My only gripe is that my simple mobile sim card is incompatible. Other than that I'm satisfied with it.,OK
"I ordered this phone thinking it was the real deal but then to find out it's an european phone and can not receive downloads or pictures. What is the sense of having a camera phone you cannot share pictures, download ringtones or games of your choice.I suggest if you want this phone with all the features you get it directly from the manufacturer or a cell phone store. This was a gift for my husband and was emabarresed when I found out all of this by taking it to a Cingular store, yes I paid cheaper but was not given the full description of what I was getting.",OK
"I love the phone, my only issues are the battery dies to quick, and doesn't work in certain areas it needs to be Verizon not att, I suggest you check service area first. Oh ya and earplugs don't work, it's the phone because I tried other ear plugs and they didn't work either.",OK
"Probably not the best Blackberry for everyone, but it has good basic features, although somewhat slow to work. Let's say 3 star out of 5",OK
"My charging port broke after a month or so because of a manufacturer's defect. This is a common issue with these phones. I got a battery charger and spare battery from Amazon for like $10. It's a pretty nice phone though. Sometimes it'll be weird with certain apps (snapchat, for example), but it does what I need it to do. This has been my main phone for months and I like it.",OK
"This phone came to me ""Brand New"", everything wrapped and sealed. This phone is NOT a dual sim as the seller advertises and I am ANGRY about that, my nano sim fits in the primary slot, and does not fit in the secondary slot even when fitted side ways, on doing research I found the tray should say ""SIM2\microSD"", my tray says only ""microSD"".Only reason I bought from this seller because of high ratings and was fulfilled by amazon.I will never again buy from this seller.",OK
"When I turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, but not sure if that is normal! be Careful what supplier you use, because I check warranty status for my phone and it does not have warranty, I didn't see what any specification like it when I did buy it!",OK
Phone would not charge. Had to put the battery in another phone to charge it. Would not recommend this phone.,OK
Hi.I did buy s6 32gb.but I am not sure is original or fake.because original seal is removed and another seal is attached.Phone alike new and unused.but cellphone time is fixed 20 march 2014.I know that is producted after 2015. I live in europe.I have stayed 3 months in U.S.A. I have no time for return or change.I hope it is original and unused.I have no chanse doing something.,OK
"I've had this phone for about a week now, and I can't deal with it anymore. The look and feel of the phone is amazing. However, I was unable to send text messages, make phone calls, or search anything on the web without having to reissue the command 4-6 times (basically anything a phone is used for). In addition, some apps were not working properly on this phone. Unfortunately, I'm returning the phone for these reasons.Though, I do have to admit that the battery of this phone lasts an incredibly long time. I'm a big social media scroller, emailer, shopper, ect. and the battery lasts me two days on one charge.",OK
This phone only came with 2gb of ram tho it states 3gb here on Amazon. A bit laggy with the off screen swipe gestures.,OK
"The day I bought this phone I was searching for a 4g smart phone, and 4g aondroid phone and the search brought me to the HTC incredible. The reason I would have givin it 2 1/2 stars is this phone is a 3g. At the Same time I ordered a 4g sim card which I ended up giving it away.",OK
"good phone for this price, it has everything you will need in a smartphone, windows 7 is very cool but not enough to reach android or IOs. It has seriously problems in synchronization with other blue tooth devices or wifi networks, so if you need data transfer is going to be a problem in some cases.",OK
"Old system , can't install some apps, upgrade to ice cream no longer supported by Samsung. If just need basic phone, ok.!",OK
"Phone is good, I dislike the ability to press the per button so easily... It causes many butt dials and texts bc the screen comes on. Other than that, phone is on. Camera is good and good sound quality. Using it on tmobile has caused some minor issues getting texts and calls but that's what I get for using an unlocked phone",OK
"I recently ordered this, love the phone but the package was opened and there were no headphones at all. Like in the description. When I want NEW, I want to pay for NEW. Unopened, unused, all contents. Disappointing",OK
Great phone! But two weeks after I brought it the screen was unresponsive didn't respond to touch or nothing had to send it back.,OK
"I brought this to be my first venture into the land of smartphones and texting. I thought I could not give a manual keyboard which is the primary reason why I brought it. Once I learned how to text with a stylus, the Qwerty keyboard became unnecessary. I sent this one back because it was defective. Returning it was fast and without any problems.",OK
"Good basic phone but spends a lot of time to update settings when it is turned off and back on. It is just a gliche with the phone, but it is a very sturdy phone....sometimes the speaker makes it hard to hear what people are saying.",OK
"I needed something easy when I traveled to China and Australia. Easy to put a sim in, and works, but within a month I found I could no longer hear the caller unless I put it on speaker phone- and if I put in ear plugs I could hear them but they couldn't hear me! So some glitch went on there. Great, however, for texting and plans in other countries are cheap for that. Overall, it lasted while I was overseas, but that was a few months - and with the last couple as speakerphone only. So that's something to consider. It's cheap, it won't get stolen, and it does get in TV to watch while waiting for planes/etc. Nothing fancy, but gave me a life line so I wouldn't get stranded.Another downside, as mentioned, is that it's really hard to navigate and the instruction manual is very very limited.",OK
"the phone is ok? i cant get the fingerprint security to work, i think it overheats and the battery drains very fast. what is really bad is the customer service. i have emailed them and tried to contact them via their facebook page....no response.",OK
"smart phone arrived well but has some technical flaws, sometimes unresponsive touch screen and stays stuck",OK
"There's some kind of dust or serving stuck on the inside of the camera lens SL I can't use the rear camera at all, but I don't plan on tskomg photos with this phone, so I'm not at a loss. Works great, fact shipping",OK
"this phone came earlier, it was completely brand new. The only problem was the charger it came with never worked well, it was loose. it had no much accessaries besides the charger but overall, i'll recommend this phone, its worth it.",OK
"Lets get to the nitty grittyPros*Looks very nice. Sleek. I loved it, until it broke.*Fits two cards and a folded billCons*Major design flaw that makes it worthless; The door is held in place by two short, slim, molded plastic pieces that break under the same amount of pressure it takes to open the stiff door, which I did carefully once I saw how the entire back piece was attached to the case. First one side, and a few days later, the other.I've been so unimpressed with this product I haven't bothered to write a review until now. - Bad for other consumers, but probably good for the manufacturer. So, my apologies to anyone who bought this product and wasted their money in the meantime.",OK
Seems like blackberries are only getting worse. The quality was ok but the software was super sluggish.,OK
The phone wasn't new like they claimed and it doesn't want to charge all the time. It doesn't want to connect to 3g either. Plus the battery doesn't want to keep a good charger. I'm not happy with the phone at all.,OK
"Very nice phone when its getting reception. In same room, my s2 will have 3 bars note will have 1. Doesn't do well in rural area.",OK
Ever since i had the phone it's been acting up. The screens switch back and forth on their own. I can't send or receive picture messages. Other than that the phone works ok.,OK
PHONE LOOKS GREAT BUT WHEN DAUGHTER HAD IT FOR AWHILE SHE TRIED TO USE THE SPEAKER AND FOUND OUT IT DOESNT WORK,OK
"Has one of the best speakers I've ever heard, runs fairly smoothly without major problems. Resets itself on occasion and apps and even messenger like to stop responding sometimes more often then others. My Major problem is for whatever reason when I call people nobody can hear me, like I am whispering or far away from the phone, however if I put in my headphones people can hear me fine. Since I use my headphones almost constantly anyways not a huge issue, but a problem nonetheless if i don't have headphones around or they break.",OK
"I bought this primarily because it looks so crazy and it's cheap enough that I decided to see how bad the text input is.The text input is hilariously bad. It could be good if you wanted to annoy your friends or convince someone you didn't understand texting, or if you just DGAF and want to blame your laziness on a phone. The crazy texting might also help add a sense of urgency if you were sending texts in an emergency too, I guess.In all seriousness, the phone does have an excellent battery life, has a distinctive look that I still kind of love, and has good voice quality.",OK
"Without earphones, economic, nothing much, himself software than 5 years ago. It could get better, for my country ARG it is acceptable in price and quality. 16Gb is not enough, usable there are only 8Gb.",OK
"Those phone seemed to be awesome. a great screen, nicely constructed, it met or exceeded all expectations. this is until I discovered it is not compatible with Android Auto. Due to the graphics processor in the phone it is not recognized by Android auto. If this feature is as important to you as it was to me then despite Neoix having a great phone this is not the phone for you. Would out cost too much more to ensure you include a compatible graphics processor?",OK
"The phone is already not working properly, keeps turning off by itself, display disappears so i cannot enter numbers/password to get into voice mail",OK
"i love the phone the touch screen is not working in the middle after one month no big deal but i cant press the letters G or the number 6 , didn't come with the headphones, and the speaker is not enough loud i think is broken also,",OK
I love the blu dash phone. I need a dual sim card for it and I don't know how to go about getting it for my phone.,OK
HOLA BUENAS TARDE QUIERO SABER SI HAY ALGUN PROBLEMA CON MI PEDIDO EL BB8520 ES QUE TENGO CIERTAS DUDASGRACIAS,OK
Phone is good. Love the big screen. Performs well.. But the mic doesn't work.. No one can hear me whe making calls.. Or when I receive calls. No one can help me fix this issue..,OK
"I bought more than 10 phones of posh ,but this phone is nice lot of memory the only problem the screen is too light it can crack any time and the speaker last less than a week and start acting deferent but beside that, posh mobile is a good Brand if they use good material to assemble their phones.",OK
"This phone was great a first, now it constantly freezes! Im not sure why, but its very very annoying! It especially does this on the texting! And on the facebook app. I've tried everything, taking off apps..erasing ALL texts nothing helps.. Time for a new phone, I ve had this for about a year.",OK
I purchased an unlocked phone and got a locked phone and had to spend another $60 to unlock it. Very disappointed considering I do not live in the country to return it.,OK
"I think the phone overall is very nice....I bought it back in May of this year ('09). Now...only a little over 7 months of having the phone, my screen is constantly going out...the phone will be on and flly functional, but the screen will not light up....i've changed the battery, the charger, resetting..still no luck. I called Amazon to see how I would go about getting it replaced,..and they couldn't help me because it was after 30 days of the purchase...so where does my full year warranty come in? well i contacted Nokia as well...the customer service was not good...and they basically told me they wouldnt replace my phone...i'd have to send it in and wait until they fix it (supposedly) and send it back. I really loved my phone, but this dissapoints me. I prob wont buy another Nokia touchscreen.",OK
"I'm just giving 3 stars for now as I still don't know if the phone works good or not.The phone arrived on time but when I put in my Metro PCS SIM card it won't recognize it.I checked on the website and it clearly states that phone is compatible with AT&T,T-Mobile,Metro PCS and most GSM carriers.I will go to the Metro PCS store tomorrow to see if there's a way get it to work.UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!,,,I went to Metro PCS to get a newer SIM card and this time it worked,had to pay an extra $15 but the phone is running and is working properly.I think the price is ok for a phone like this.The phone is thin and it looks like is well constructed,the only weird thing is that the power button is on the upper left side but I can live with that.The screen isn't too bright but I can also live with that and for a phone with a 5.5 screen is not bulky or too big,I just love the size and I'm happy with my phone.WELL I'M GIVING THE PHONE 4 STARS!!!!!!",OK
"Easy to use and it is very light. Texting and all medias it's perfect and fast. The only thing is the camera. I read before I placed my order, somebody said that the camera was very clean and perfect. Even being only 5pm. But this is no true. The camera is very blare and the pictures quality is not good and also the videos. But the rest it is very fair. I think that for the $ I paid is so so.",OK
I like the phone. I can't decide if it's me or the phone but it does some strange things when I'm adding my contacts.,OK
"Decent phone starting to show age, watch what you get though it was advertised as a unlocked phone but it's not I received the AT&T branded",OK
It's totally not the same like the one I bought many years ago from Sony store. This does not look like a real phone.,OK
"It is slow comparing to nowadays phones , it cant detect far wifi spots .",OK
Its a good phone but it's not working in singapore. Its says unlocked but it isn't,OK
The phone works with the new battery but has to be restarted every couple of days because it says it can't read the Sim card. But it's fine other than that. .,OK
"Well, this is the second duos galaxy to buy because the first was stolen. I love this phone, I love it so buy it, but this time I was not so good with the purchase, has arrived in perfect condition but has missed the headset. Not that happened here but it's annoying that I have to now invest in something that had already paid.",OK
"Well the product itself, I would have to say one star... I only had the phone for about 3 weeks when it crapped out. The charge port stopped working. No matter what charger I used, or which outlet, it wouldn't take a charge.The seller I would give five stars though. They have been very cooperative, answered all of my emails, and I just sent them back the phone for a refund.",OK
"I have not had any major problems out of this phone. I'm only giving it three stars because if you're like me, I can not stand a phone that lags when you operate it. Once i push one of the buttons it literally takes one second for the phone to respond. That just gets on my nerves, but overall the phone functions well.",OK
"I have a outer box for my phone and sometimes it doesn't charge, I have to keep moving it around on the charger b4 the blue charge light comes on. It also take hours b4 it charges the phone. For the price it okay",OK
The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product,OK
"While yes, the phone is unlocked, however, you're unable to activate for Cricket.Don't be like me and not do simply research!",OK
This phone is not good at all. None of the two phones are fully functional. A waste of money sorry!!!!!,OK
"It is not as good as iphone, but it is ok. Dual sim feature was the reason of my selection of this phone as a second phone, as I have to keep 3 phone numbers available. Touch screen is quite poor, reaction time is slow. Anyway, it saves me from carrying an additional phone. Otherwise I would not suggest.",OK
At first everything worked fine but when I started turning it off and on it will never turn on. It's like It would start over wen I try to turn it on,OK
"Pros: - nice screen size and keyboard- awesome amount of internal storage place, you barely need a memory card with 16gb of storage!- androidCons: - it has started freezing a lot. I would say per day, I have to reset the phone about 4 or 5 times because it freezes up and you can't even power it off, you have to take the battery out to reset it",OK
Screen resolution is good.The maps app is exceptional.Turn by turn directions are extremely accurate.Web surfing is very poor and buffers all the time. YouTube downloads are really slow and worthless as you can barely watch it before it buffers.,OK
"Good afternoon, I have this to say hello to indicate that the product was successfully received, tell them beforehand that the product lacks microsd memory and its respective handsfree, which did not come and I appreciate your response to this detail .... My email: brenisjoseg@gmail.com, I appreciate your attention to this detail, because everything has acsesorios phone at purchase.",OK
"Some time after purchase (about 2 weeks), the screen turns off when I try to use the keyboard on it. It happens randomly.",OK
"Some issues with the ""back/return"" button. It does not always recognize that it is being touched.",OK
The item says unlocked but buyers beware that you will have to pay $50 t0 $80 to have it activated.So they price of the phone goes up.And if your not in the UK you can't use the android market whic was a waste of money because basically u can only call receive calls (once the phone is unlocked) send messages no games no apps and you can navigate with wifi,OK
i think that the phone had some use because it had a broken piece so it didnt came in perfect conditions,OK
So this is the second phone that I have ordered from here. My first phone was freezing a lot. The second phone I got was hard for the sim slot to come out. The phone was working fine up until I did the wireless update that would not go away. Now the phone is freezing all the time and takes forever to do what I try to get it to do. I like the fact that the phone is big and the camera. The only problem I have is it freezing.,OK
After a few moments months the micro USB port broke. I now only charge it wirelessly. It has also started to shut off randomly every once in a while. These problems may be because I bought it refurbished.,OK
pros:good hard ware and build quality.awesome sound and display.cons:as it is AT&T version no automatic updateshave to update manually (need to take backup of the entire data when update is performed.. its a big hassle)no kit kat update for AT&T version yet.Single sim.I would give 5 start for factory unlocked version.,OK
The quality of this phone is great and the pictures are clear and if someone has bad eye sight like my husband this would be the perfect phone. THe only problem we had was that it was advertised as an unlock phone and I could never get the sims card to go thru straight talk and I had to call ATT and that is when I found out the phone was not unlocked. I contacted Amazon and they allowed me to return the phone for a full refund. I have ordered another phone but from a different company and we will see if it is unlocked.,OK
"very low memory space! When downloading apps even with a memory card at times it says theres not enough room when really there is more than enough. also sometimes the screen freezes up, and I have to cut off the screen and cut it back on. But besides that and the terrible memory space its what you pay for. Not too bad of a phone",OK
"This item was advertised as ""new."" It turned out to be re-manufactured in China. The device works fine, no glitches so far, but it was misleading to advertise it as new instead of refurbished or something similar.",OK
I did not see much difference between s5 and s4 except s5 crashed several time when using internet . There is no more exciting options for photo editing tool. Another annoying thing is some extra apps were automatically installed when starting from factory setting. Default Language is Germany. The date showed in 'phone hidden' bar back to year of 2013. A little bit confusing about this product.,OK
Delivery was perfect and it was newVery fast phone but the lg g2s have a problem with the screen after 25 days of use searsh it on youtube and you will fing results about g2's they are good cheap fast strong but the gets messed up after a few uses.,OK
The price has been decreasing everyday since I bought it.The phone has been working fine so far for a month though,OK
"I really like the phone, but nobody mentioned that Samsung Pay does not work with this, the international version - I had to call Samsung Support to find that out.. disappointed and send it back for that reason...",OK
"Absolutely love the concept of this phone but ultimately I had to return it only because the battery simply was inadequate. I don't do a lot of social media or apps but still the battery seems to barely last 8 hours. However on the positive side, I love the size of this thing and I'm so exasperated by phone manufacturers designing bigger and bigger phones. Kudos to Posh for building this and hopefully in future products they will improve battery performance.",OK
"its a nice phone , but the data usage is working. maybe because it is a boost mobile phone",OK
good clear picture /screen doe.s not hold charge long enough .low ring tone !over all ok ?,OK
"When I received this in the mail after ordering, I couldn't have been happier. The color was vibrant, the case fit snug and secure, and it bore the Lifeproof logo so I was content. Until 2 weeks later. The cover that covers the charger port is EXTREMELY snug and after 2 weeks of opening and closing it to charge it every night, it gave and broke off. I've gone through two cases and they have both done the same thing. I didn't want to keep having to replace my case every 2 weeks so I ordered something else and returned it for a refund. I am way too busy to be waiting on phone cases. Other than that, the case seems great tho.",OK
"Sending it back. Apps can not download as this phone can only take up to ios 7, and all the new apps are now using ios 9",OK
"I am happy with most of the characteristics of this mobile. except for:1. its wifi connection. For some reason it does not perform well when compared to other devices connected to the same wifi signal2. its 3G is not working well, at least in Argentina. far too slowCamera is great, Processor fast. Do not expect a slim model though!",OK
Not a bad phone for the price. It could easily get an A for a grade if it were not for its very poor battery performance.,OK
"Cheap , does what is suppose toyou can use youtube and call text no problemno multitasking so don't think you will get to play games and watch movies on this small deviceI would recommend it to anyone who needs a back up phone work phone or wants to give it to your kid so they can watch youtube.for this price you can't go wrong with it",OK
Great phone. Sadly its not 4G. And doesnt work as well yet has great features.,OK
"After two weeks with the phone I must say: Its a good phone! However DO NOT BUY IT. First you will struggle to make the data, network and wifi work properly, the wifi is really poor btw. Additionally, I dropped the phone once, from my bed, not a big deal, but guess? The display cracked and now it wont turn on. How can a phone be so sensitive? My previous Motorola was so resistant, a perfect phone for me, however this version seems to be made of poor material.",OK
"I'm a Straight Talk user. I must say the phone itself is great. It has all the features that you can ask for. Popped in my Straight Talk sim card and changed the APN and it was working like a breeze. The only thing is they packaged the phone with this horrible sticker on the front of the screen. It took a while to get it off without scratching the face. Then the audio sucks, no matter what type of headphones I use.",OK
I bought the bb phone And i have vera expectative about Thais product but no satifice complety beca use i have trouble with the batery,OK
I had the phone for 6 months. i purchased a used one and it had water damage.,OK
"It is as advertised. But when I received it, it was smaller than what I had in mind. One of the best feature about it is the radio, in my opinion. I spent time away and stayed in a house without TV, the radio was great to have.",OK
"This is the second time I've bought this phone. I LOVED the first one. It was affordable, fast, and I loved the big bright screen. Its a pleasantly large phone, and sturdy. Its gotten wet and still worked fine after it dried out. However, once this one bites the dust, I probably won't get the same model again. Though I adore this phone, service on it is spotty at best. I use T-Mobile with it, and I am constantly getting kicked offline/ off phone calls.",OK
Photos are pretty decent but videos are not that great. Do not put away your video recorders...,OK
I like the phone and it is still a very powerful device despite the recent ones launched. I would've kept it if the battery had fully charged. It only charged up to 92%-93% despite charging it for hours.,OK
"its an okay phone, It just doesn't fit my style for a phone I would like. If you like the full touch screen and are a slower texter then I would recommend this phone. If all you do is text, this phone is not for you.",OK
"Physical keyboard has many keys that don't work. Didn't come with a manual or any SD card. I'm not impressed, but not mad.",OK
looking good but missing above items please check before ordinghave to check about functions and performance.First look is good,OK
"really nice phone, great features, nice color, lightweight, but the softkeys doesnt light up ... too bad for night tasking",OK
"It told me I was buying a 16GB phone and it only has 11GB, need to look closer to the product, but all in al it is amazing. Not a single issue.",OK
The phone looks nice and works but the home button you have to press hard sometime don't like that.Everything else work great. Still like check on YouTube on how to fix it hope that works.,OK
"I love my old htc sensation. I drop that one and the screen got broken. I decided to buy the same one because it was so inexpensive! Well, the camera works but I can't make videos... so that is why it was so inexpensive?",OK
I can use it to make calls but that is about it. The manual does not help with trying to get this phone to English and I also tried dialing the #0044# like someone on here has suggested and that does nothing as well. Very frustrating. I will continue to search the internet but it would be nice since I am in the US for it to come automatically in English.,OK
Great phone except my GPS doesn't work. Don't want to hassle with a return. Next phone would probably be screwed up too.,OK
Was not able to get updates from Samsung due to phone being sent from another country to the U.S. But love the phone and had no major issues.,OK
"Bought this phone to replace my old Windows phone that I loved. I checked reviews and took a hard look at multiple phones before settling on the NEXUS. I'm not someone who wants or needs lots of functions on my phone and the Nexus fit that bill well.Plusses: phone is pretty intuitive to use, easy to make calls, texts, and emails. Comes with a reasonable assortment of apps Voice recognitions works pretty well, especially ""Ok, google"" Screen illumination is good Screen resolution is pretty goodCons:Really only one big one: BATTERY LIFE IS TERRIBLE-- the battery monitor says usually 24 hours, but I'm not sure I've made that yet.Once you open an app, you have to go to herculean efforts to shut them off to save battery life.OVERALL: If I had it to do over again, I'd look elsewhere unless the price was really cheap!",OK
"We like the phone but the screen cracked when it was dropped on a countertop. I don't think that should have happened. I can understand if it was dropped on a hard floor or concrete, but not a very short drop face up on a counter top.",OK
battery is not holding charge long enough. Even though I am not talking the battery continues to run down. Other than that I love the phone,OK
i usually like LG smart phones because they have clear displays but i think it has some errors on program or something. It also doesn't catch Wifi that well.,OK
I was so excited because I revive a beautiful iPhone... But when I tried to use it it says that I can't do it because it's not supporting my SIM card... What can I do? My company is AT&T and I can't understand why is not working...,OK
Phone is in good condition touch screen is not so great but it's working perfect. Photo resolution is good .,OK
"Firstly, the phone is solid! Unfortunately AT&T does not support this model for 4G or LTE, nor do they support secure payment apps for this phone. Although the phone supports said features, AT&T will not support them unless the phone is locked to the AT&T network and branded. This is extremely disappointing as the international version is over $100 less than a branded phone tied to the carrier.",OK
I did not like the way the screan curves on the sides. Tempered glass and even regular screan protectors will not lay flat so of you do not mind using a phone with out any kind of screan protection on it. I also did not like the fact the home screan only had two places. My LG stylo has five and I did not like only having two. My daughter and son like theirs and are happy. I did not and re-activated my old phone right away. To each their own. So out of the three I bought I was the only one who did not like the lay out.,OK
"The 5 inch screen on this phone is great, Sound is very good, build quality is great, but launcher they have on this phone is not verygood but launchers from the play store fix this problem so in all a good phone for the money and a hundred bucks cheaper than aNexus 5 with the same 32 g storage.I like the screen on this better than the Galaxy S4 I had.",OK
Problems with screen and apps loading and have to restart constantly for both to load. I previously reported to seller but to date still not resolved.,OK
"Bought this as a phone to have for use during international travel. We travel to Israel regularly as our daughter lives there and decided it would be cheapest to own a phone that we can just buy a Sim card for while there. We figured we could also use it if we travel to other countries. The phone basically worked fine for calls and texting. Nothing fancy. It is not a smart phone, which we knew. It was easy enough to figure out how to use it. Was not crazy about the sound clarity. Would not like it for my regular phone but good if you want a phone for just travel use. Did not want to spend the money for an unlocked smart phone but did miss having one at times to look up things as we were traveling. The phone supposedly had some internet access but I could never access it.",OK
Don't get me wrong it is a decent phone but for the price no. This should be $150,OK
"The phone was good a few days but, then started to have touch screen issues. Whether needed to be restarted or not letting me select the letters I was trying to text.. Not a bad phone, but, I could see why it was sold. Fortunately, I'd order 2 phones in case, and the other phone turned out to be stellar. Still will keep the iPhone as a possible Urgent back up and it looked nice. Just caliberation, durability and battery life, left much to be desired.",OK
"I like the look of the phone, But it is really hard to hear someone talk on it. I don't know why and when it is on vibrate, I never hear it, and I always would have my phone on vibrate and could hear it. I wish now I would have sent it back.Thank You!",OK
"Pretty simple to figure out. It comes with good ringtones, the camera is not very good. The auto lock is good but a little annoying because it flashes the lock screen if you touch any thing. It is not compatible with the contact sync from Verizon's website.",OK
"It said its new but I got a used one , it has some app's already installed from Middle East but the device it self looks new they should say it's used not new!",OK
"Product arrived with a defect in the screen. The bottom half inch of the screen in the very corners was not responsive. I got around this by making the keyboard LARGE and using SWIFTKEYIt worked.Everything else worked nicely. Great screen, good battery life, decent camera.. it worked fine until I ended up sitting on it and cracking the screen.It was a good option rather than paying $600 for a new Galaxy Note 23G and Wifi speeds were fine",OK
The phone arrived in perfect time. I bought it for my mother because her 1st android phone had died. I set her up with a Google account and downloaded the Zedge app and got a few ring tones and wallpapers. It took her Sim card and she was good to go...so I thought. It turns out that the contact list in the phone was completely full with the previous owner's history! I believed that I had paid for a brand new phone. The 3 star rating is because the phone was easy to navigate but it was refurbished and the previous history was not even wiped out! The camera acted more like a 2mp instead of the advertised 5mp. It's a nice phone for beginners but the Seller needs to advertise if it's been slightly used or a complete refurbished phone. Please listen to the reviews about the cameras and not what is falsely advertised.,OK
"it's okay for a refurbished phone for now, will be going back to samsung, phone is slow and have problem with locking up.",OK
Borrowed a phone like this from my son when my simple cell phone died. Loved it.Buying a Rock to replace my phone was a heartache. Bought four phones to get one that works. And it sucks power with all it's gadgets (I suppose) that I'm charging it almost every day. Wouldn't buy another.,OK
"It is exactly what expected, Low specs nice phone.Good for a cheap nice solution and a backup phone in case you lose your main phone.",OK
This wasnt the phone I wanted but its doing its job as it says. however when i did put in a memory card full with stuff it just stuck when i took it out it worked fine so Iooks like it cant take much jamming but the camera is cool i like it.,OK
Phone is working fine and everything works fine . But the charger and charger cable provided is not working properly .Battery last only one day maximum . I am not sure that's about other iPhone 5 battery and if all iPhone 5 are like that then that is fine.,OK
Nice product - some bugs for USA based use. 1) Not 4G compatible on T-Mobile 2) Firmware often uses Chinese not English. 3) Instructions are in Chinese 4) Pop up and unwanted adds. Other little things like that they that maybe could be overcome if English instructions were available. For some reason the Lenovo website does not list this item - makes me think it is not true - Lenovo.Regarding the vendor Weil Technology. This item arrived a day earlier than scheduled - package was very secure. I will use this vendor again!,OK
"Good phone for the basics. I am a high volume texter - the long battery life is good for that. The major downside to this phone is the microphone and the speaker phone are one in the same volume. If you are okay with holding this to your head all the time then don't worry about that aspect... but the screen can and will freak out with the tiniest bit of liquid (sweat) on it. You get what you pay for with this - phone works as a phone, cannot handle many apps at once (duh - low ram and slower processor), battery lasts a heck of a long time, and great for your basic calling and texting - great phone to have in a drawer as a spare for when you break your better phone and await a warranty.",OK
"My wife has used this phone in the US, Western amd Eastern Europe, and Turkey. You can change the system language to English (the default is Spanish) so a non Spanish reading person can navigate the phone itself. Just remember that you cannot send or receive texts in any other but those two languages. Outside of that, it works great once acquiring the correct sim card for the region.",OK
I buy this phone like a month ago for my wife and when I try to download Tune in radio I can download I have a little problem with this phone but I like it in I don't know how I can fix it,OK
"I received this item with the understanding that it was unblocked and ready to be used abroad with a chip,however,upon landing in Lima-PerÌ¼ I realized that the phone was not ready to be used because I had not been unblocked,therefore,in order for me to be able to use it,I had to incur in an additional expense which was about $30 US dollars.",OK
"Phone is 3G and somewhat glitchy, only 500MB of Ram, which may be the problem.",OK
freezes and goes to the HTC screen often. but is working as thetemporary phone i needed,OK
Its useful but its super slow. And smaller in real life too. One thing thats the main problem was how long it took to open apps and the speed of the phone overall. Probably because its only 512 MB ram.,OK
"When I purchased my Lenovo A916 it was for its large screen size, the ability to be used on the Straight Talk phone service and the megapixel count for the camera on this device. I still enjoy all of those things, the fact that it has removable battery with longevity past what I expected but there is something deeply dissatisfying about some apps from the play store not working on this phone.",OK
I read the other reviews and they were right the battery life in between charges is very short. I also had a problem with it the first week I had it. The battery was almost dead and I put it on the charger and it did not take a charge. I also tried the car charger still no luck. This phone also needs a micro sim card so I had to go back to my service and get a standard sim card so i could use my other phone after all that i tried to charge my phone again and then it started to take a charge again. I like that I can hear people talking to me. I also like the screen quality,OK
"Its okay but it still has a few issues like other phones. screen freezes, freezes somestimes when surfing the internet.",OK
"best QWERTY phone I have had yet, BUT still gets slow when apps are installed.",OK
"I bought one galaxy edge s6 plus, unfortunately it is made in china. I am currently living in the USA so I could not plug it on the wall to charge, what can I do? I can pay it back, okay?",OK
"It is a Dual SIM phone, but when you really put two SIM card (one micro SIM and one nano SIM) using the tiny, space limited side drawer, you cannot put a micro-SD card because they design to share the micro-SD card slot with the nano SIM card slot.For me, I really need to put 2 SIM, one for company, another for personal. So, putting 2 SIM and cannot get memory expansion for video & photo, and this short comes is not mentioned in the product description. If I know it before, I would buy BLU Studio One 4G. I only give it 3 star.",OK
"This is a very good phone,one of Nokia's good quality phones made and with Symbian Soft ware..I have not used it much yet but i am looking forward to using it as my stand bye phones.",OK
"No scratches on the glass and worked nearly as described, except the headphone jack is broken -- which is a real bummer. The apple store will only replace the phone for as much as I already paid for it or I have the option of fixing it myself, which really is not what I want to do. I'm too nervous about doing further damage inside. I guess this is what I get for buying a used phone. Other than that, it works perfectly and arrived quickly.",OK
"The battery life does not last very long, other than that the phone is ok.",OK
Ive had this phone for about 3wks and I went to plug it in today and my screen went black and died,OK
"Bought 2, one for myself and boyfriend freezes like crazy. Numerous restarts before it functions at times",OK
I bought it for my husband it works good but the blue tooth is not connecting and we have no browser access,OK
"I'm a middle aged, white-collar guy who carries phone clipped to his belt. For this reason, I thought the belt clipped Otterbox would be the way to utility and protection.. Wrong! While the case is big and sturdy, it also is heavy and feels clunky in the hand. The belt clip is a royal pain in the butt. Uncomfortable to wear (jabs into my side), I often find myself fiddling with two hands to lock the phone case into the clip. Several times I thought it was snapped in only to have phone fall to the floor. (Glad the otterbox well-protects against drops!) Finally, 30 dollars is way too much to pay for this case. Still shopping around for smaller but durable bumper case that will slip into my old leather, swivel case that slips onto my belt. Thanks.",OK
"Bluetooth function is horrible. To be honest, you get what you pay for. However, it's a functional phone that is unlocked, and works if you travel internationally with any sim card. The dual sim function is tricky though.",OK
Phone developed sound pick up issues right away!The lady who sold me the phone was great at making things right! I was 100% satisfied at the way she handled Everything.I would buy from her again! Other than the sound pick up issue phone was good.,OK
I'm keeping this as a backup. Loses signal in places where my Motorola phone keeps working.,OK
"I do not like the system consume 1.5 ram without any application is active.Heated several times without doing anything on the phone .I thought that the processor was 1.8 GHZ and see that it is only 1.5 GHZ information would be fine .Sometimes when writing the writing delay.Many details that I do not like the Phone , expected better things from Asus",OK
Nice case. Just has too many groves where dirt and things can get caught and make it look dirty and old. I returned it.,OK
Nice phone. Great screen for watching movies & videos. Good camera but I don't get reception where I live & it is dual sim stand-by. Browsing the internet is good too,OK
"My wife has a hard time keeping this thing charged. It seems very finicky about the cable and/or charger. It has some bloat ware on it that I haven't been able to remove. 32 GB is sufficient. It works with Consumer Cellular if you let them know you need T-mobile. It also works with the free T-mobile service. It comes with a SIM card that allows you to use the free service. It's very fast and has a nice screen. My wife is VERY far-sighted and is able to read it just fine. We had to send it in once since it would not charge. We were blamed for not using the original cable and charger, but these did not work any better. After the repair, it's a little easier to charge, but not much.",OK
Temper seal on package box broken and phone looks refurbishedbut is working so I've decided to keep it .,OK
"i'm not sure that price may be higher then quality.but this device has quality problems. after 1.5 year use, u will noticebad pixels on display. some useless services not kill, and etc",OK
"The phone itself would have been fine - but we had issues with the battery or charger not sure - either way, withing a day it wouldn't charge at all - sent it back, no problem with the refund. I even got a new battery - which probably technically wasn't new as in recently made...it still didn't work. I think it had been sitting around too long.",OK
"The phone is great, works perfect, everything is perfect. BUT the 1 year warranty is crock. it doesn't cover ''accidental'' damage. only regular technical problems. SO read the fine print. or you will have to buy a screen yourself or send it in.",OK
"I got the phone and it is what I expected. No problem with anything of consequence. Did not get 8 GB Sandisk SD card free offered on page. Users guide in Chinese, no problem. Found it on line in English.AFTER MORE THAN A WEEK OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN FGS TRADING (OFFERING ME A $5 DISCOUNT FOR THE 8 GB SD CARD NOT INCLUDED IN SHIPMENT BUT STILL BEING OFFERED ON THE AMAZON PRODUCT PAGE) POINTING THE FINGER TO EACH OTHER - FGS AND AMAZON'S BUYER GUARANTEE - I'VE DECIDED TO GIVE UP ON AMAZON AND FGS. SOMEBODY SHOULD FULFILL THE WHOLE OFFER AS STATED IN THE PRODUCT PAGE OR ELIMINATE THE FREE OFFER FROM THE PAGE.",OK
"I recommend this phone to those who need a smart phone but don't want to pay the high iphone price. I am still trying to get used to how this phone works ( as with any cell phone) but the one thing that I do not particularly like is that after taking five photos, the phone restarts itself.If i take pics as if I were going to attach them to a message then the camera is fine. Weird, but the phone is still good.",OK
It is okay but the Beats Audio not corresponding and you did not tell me this.I am sad about it.thanks.,OK
I will wear it as a watch and nothing else. I cant answer calls with it even when connected to bluetooth.,OK
Love the phone however it is easy to shatter. So be careful while handling. My rec is to buy a piece of tempered glass for it! you won't regret it.,OK
"I am a big fan of the Windows Phone OS, and I really like the design of the Lumia devices. This has a large, bright screen, very easy to use. Takes GREAT pictures. The built in wireless charging is a great feature. The bad. Is heavy. Is fragile. Do not believe the YouTube videos where they throw one of these at a brick wall and it is unscathed. First one, my daughter (first day she got it), dropped it off her elevated bed. It hit every step of the ladder on the way down. Screen shattered. Second one (1 and 2 purchased at same time). My wife after about a year, sort of flipped it up in the air accidently and it hit the tile floor. Screen shattered. OK, I'll give Lumia 1 and 2, but number 3, daughter about a week after she got it, dropped from waist high on to a laminate floor. Screen shattered.",OK
"This phone will arrive with an European travel charger. You either need to carry an adapter with you all the time or spend another $15-$50 to buy an OEM/Original Samsung Travel Charger. This is the first time I bought an electronic device from amazon.com with a non-compatible charger in North America.I love the phone and I would give it 5 stars. I had been iPhone user since iPhone 3G. But I returned my iphone 6 and got a s6 edge. I love the design, the feel and the features.",OK
I didn't really like the display and the phone it got wasn't factory unlock... That's about it...but still a good product for some people.,OK
"the item was delivered after 10 days of ordering it.the phone is quite ok considering its price.the scree is crisp ad clear,the touch screen sensor is great,a light touch will do the work,very sensitive.Whe it comes to the camera,the rear camera gives a decent pictures,frot camera is disgusting.i am not yet sure if straight talk 45 dollar unlimitted data will work on this phone,i am still waiting for the sim card i order.",OK
"If you want to buy the ""Nexus Protect"" insurance 2 years for $69, you can't unless you buy this phone from the Google Store. This may not be an issue for you, but for me I have to have it. My carrier Sprint will not offer insurance on a phone not sold through them either. The Nexus Protect is a decent deal but does not cover complete loss or theft. It's better then nothing, and the only thing out there.Oh, also, this phone is currently $299 at Google, free shipping.",OK
"good screen resolution, it's quickly opening apps, good speakers but... that memory kills the phone, you cannot install more than 2 o 3 apps before the phone shows internal memory is full... it needs root for better performance, and this is not developed yet.",OK
"the iphone is good! but i have an issue the headphones are ""fake"" plastic not rubbery like the original I expected better but its ok!",OK
it was suppose to be an unlocked phone and it was not :( and it had to much scratches on the back of the phone,OK
"Not as well made as the old razrs battery life not very good.. I paid 79.00 for it, too high...should be around 50.00. I would not recommend this phone",OK
"I was looking for a phone I would be able to operate one-handed, water- and drop-resistant. There isn't much choice.The charging connector (the vendor supplied a USB charger) was not easy to use and it's too easy to hang up an incoming call. I'll get used to it.",OK
"I got this as a replacement for one of our phones on our plan. While it is better than the previous phone, this one seems to freeze up, and power down with no advance notice. But it does serve it's purpose when it is holding a charge.",OK
The Phone is working well now in Venezuela but it was bought unlocked and was received locked even the packing was opened. My brother had to pay extra $50 to get this unlocked In Vnzla. This is the reason I'm giving a score of 3. Provider sure ensure that is selling what is offered.,OK
Not thrilled with the Defender cases. They seem to always stretch at the corners after a year or so. Because of this they no longer fit well. I like the Commuter case much better.,OK
My son bought this late may and received it mid June. It worked out fine and he even recommended it to many other people but around the 2nd month of use it began to be uncomfortably hot while being used regularly. Now tlit is not charging at all and Overheating. Waiting on Blu and Amazon to reply for help.,OK
The product appears as the actual item but it's like a shaving of the phone material on top the phone and I can't take it off!! Also it didn't come come with the piece to open the micro chip.,OK
"This unlocked phone is good option. It fits in a jacket pocket. It has double camera. The photos are nice. A goog interface easy to use. Applications are functioning well. In short, Unfortunately the ram is very low and has little memory.",OK
"The phone keeps asking me to run the set up wizard even though I've done it about 10 times now. It was also a pain to get activated through Verizon, but it works like it's supposed to now.",OK
First phone came with a bad screen. The second one was dirty out of the box. After soccer cleaning tho it worked well.,OK
"The phone was brand new and works like a charm, some sticking is expected when you have many things working at the same time, and there is some stuff you can't get rid of but for the price it is a good deal. I was disappointed that I did not receive an SD card with the phone when they said it would be included.",OK
"This is a Good watch for the price, kinda upset that I have to buy a SIM card but other than that it's a great watch",OK
I ordered an unlocked international version of the HTC One X. Tablet Distributors sent an unlocked One X that had a AT&T software build. The phone had a AT&T boot up screen and was full of preinstalled apps from this carrier. Be careful!!!!,OK
"I bought this phone for my 12 year old and while it does work, she complains of it freezing at times. Mostly while using apps. There also isn't a lot of memory on the phone so having a SD card is a must (it comes with one, but if it gets to full, you need to buy a new one or delete things off the old one for the phone to work good).Overall this is a good choice for someone that doesn't use a lot of apps.",OK
"The Nokia 5800 is a good phone but has its downsides:Pros:- Touch screen is responsive- The full keyboard is spacious- Has a stylus but isn't really needed- Feels sturdy- Comes with 8GB of storage- Decent camera for a cell phone,- Internet browsing is decent- Comes with Wifi and Bluetooth- Good music player/radioCons:- The memory card is very hard to remove. BE CAREFUL. When I tried removing it to transfer data via SD slot, the card was such a tight fit the chip was damaged. I had to buy another memory card. It hasn't happened again but just the fact this is possible is a fatal flaw in its design.- The accelerometer is too sensitive.Overall:It's a good phone and affordable, however, not good for anything other than calling or listening to music. If you want an internet device, go with the higher end smart phones (iPhone, Blackberry, Droid, etc)",OK
"its a powerfull phone, but it heated too much and its battery life its not exceptional",OK
This cell does everything except send or receive pictures. Done buy for teenager. It cut for young child or someone who just wants to use the talk feature.,OK
"okay, so after about a year of having this phone, i noticed one major problem. it shuts off for seemingly no reason. did lots of research however, and it isn't a software issue. the phone its self is not built very well. and there is a very easy fix for this, rather than try to take it all apart and whatnot. just take a piece of paper, (lets say 3 square inches big) and fold it into 4ths. and then place the folded paper between the battery and phone. the paper does kinda make it a pain in the ass to get the battery to ""clip"" to the phone, but once its there, it keeps the battery connected to the phone much better than on its own, thus preventing the ""random"" shut downs. not so much the sellers fault, i think its verizon themselves, who poorly built this phone. nonetheless, buyer beware. env3 is a great basic phone except for this one problem. (i also believe there is a youtube video about this fix)",OK
Solid phone. Had an issue with the battery. Gorgeous case and display. Seems to have issues with apps running in the background which cause a major slowdown.,OK
not too bad but has a crack on the screenhangs once in a whileand goes off once in a while,OK
The second day i had my phone it started cutting on and off other than that is okay i guess,OK
"I have only two problems with this cell phone. The calendar can not provide re-occuring events i.e. payment reminder every month? When texting difficulty switching from alpha to numeric, very odd way to do it, and time consuming.",OK
my straight talk sim wouldn't work in this phone...it tells me to insert a new sim...What do i do? Isn't the phone supposed to be unlocked???,OK
"Teczilla! you've sent me the phone with a bad battery, this useless battery you sent me is puffed and the phone it's suddenly turning off ! so im not fully ok with this purchase. if you had said that battery is not working fine or selled the without one ,It would have been better",OK
"I have a Galaxy S III on sprint(CDMA network) which does not work on the same network as the rest of the planet(GSM). I recently purchased this phone to have a mobile phone while we vacationed in Europe. It was cheaper than any rental phone, and it takes sim cards(which are easily found anywhere in Europe). With that said, this is still a droid phone with all of the capabilities that come with that. Yes it is an older OS, but it still works fine. I like the LG phones that I've had, and this one is right up there. It's ease of use is good for anyone. The only draw-back to this phone is the screen. It's the lowest HD screen I've seen, and you lose picture when you view the screen from any angle besides direct viewing.",OK
"Not bad, pretty quick phone for this price range. MUST root to get rid of the bloatware on it though.****UPDATE 10/15/12****Phone turned out to be a disappointment. Very sluggish at times, pushed android 2.3.6 to the stock rom which fixed messaging bug. But even after putting a custom rom on it, the phone was still very slow for my blood (not to mention losing camera functions with custom rom). Gave it to my wife after her phone became water logged. She works in the city so she always has tmobile's ""4g"". She loves the phone, i don't. Bought a lumia 710 till windows phone 8 comes out.",OK
"phone is good overall, my phone had problem with sound . I returned it because of sound problem. But service provided by seller was excellent, it was manufacturing fault. It is good if you have very big hands",OK
"I ordered a refurbished model to replace the one I had. The touchpad for the middle of the keypad quit working on my old phone. The new phone has an entire strip near the top of the screen that will not respond. This blows. I like the phone, with the exception of having to dig two layers to get the the switch to turn on/off for mobile data.",OK
"Phone was unlocked, but didn't come in a box and there was no ear piece. Therefore not sure if it was new as it was advertised",OK
Evrerything good for me but it cant find my bluetooth jabra ... realy sorry. I hope that im not right but how can i know?,OK
The phone was as described and as shown. The volume during calls is very soft even when on max and the sound quality is poor during calls!,OK
"I really like the phone, looks great, sound is great, quick learning curve, but the battery life sucks. I put it on the charger before bed and it doesn't even completely charge after 6 hours of non-use. Then the battery is almost dead after a couple of hours of non-use off the charger. Not sure if it's just a bad battery from the supplier or the design of the phone itself.Not sure why the first time I sent a review in it said 'A kids review' I'm 48 years old!** Update Feb 19,2011 **The battery that came with the phone continued to get worst, to the point that if I wanted to make a call that would last 10 mins or so, I would have to plug it in and use it as a corded phone. I picked up a battery at battery+ and the new battery works well, but added another $35 dollars to the cost of the phone.",OK
"After a year my teen is fully enjoying the Studio 5 C, & I needed a replacement phone so we ordered this thinking it would be an upgrade. Software, ease of setup & organizing music, apps etc. is great like any BLU product. Although, I'm disappointed in the camera, the photos are not as clear as the 5C and unfortunately we're most having problems with the screen (my teen thinks it's singular to our device) being either not responsive enough or too responsive (there's no 'tap' it's press firmly), jumping forward even without 'auto correct' active. After a week of texting with this phone I lost patience. Tech-friend thinks maybe it's the software lagging to keep up with our fingers? Will be returning this unfortunately and trying to match the 5C or upgrade to 7.0. We gave it a good shot, & will continue to purchase BLU for their excellent quality for an unbeatable price!",OK
"I like the Samsung J7. I couldn‰Ûªt afford the sticker price for the S6 o rS7. Therefore, I opted for this which is scaled down in terms of processing speed and memory size but it is much better than the other phone I had.PRO: 13mb camera with auto focus, 16GB storage, 2GB RAM, great security, hotspot, 5.5‰Û displayCons: Low volume, tinny rear speaker, the LG cells have better rear and front speakers, you only get three bars on the meter, all my other phone get 4 bars. I think it has a small antenna. Also to receive wifi signals I have to be within 20 feet. My Samsung tablets can be 40-50 feet away a receive a good signal.If you are in a weak signal area buy a lg phone other wise buy this phone or the S7.",OK
"Got stucked on start up (Windows Logo screen). Had to reset the software to factory settings.

"SPEAKER VOLUME IS TERRIBLE,WISH I COULD REMOVE THE MOST FREQUENT CALL NAMES FROM HOME SCREEN",OK
"I got the phone cos I was looking for something cheap I could Instagram and keek on while on the road since I had a blackberry and an iPad. Well, the phone is okay but horrible camera which defeats the purpose while I got it.",OK
Fingerprint sensor was not working out of the box. I had to return it due to being defective.,OK
Phone was in good condition but as soon as it arrived I had to go out and buy a new battery for it. The one sent with device was very swollen and wouldn't hold a charge.,OK
I bought this phone for my Mum. I like it 'cos its no frills and I expect it will serve her well with basic stuff like make and receive calls.,OK
love the phone 2nd one but it never charged right. my first gzone would last 3 days on one charge. this one brand new would be dead by 4 pm. now 6 months later it does not work at all unless plugged into the car. the second you unplug it it dies. so i bought a new extended life battery. its still doin it o i guess now i gotta but a new phone and the window for return was closed in may :( can i just get a phone that works!!!!,OK
"It's a good device over all. I had the Sprint version of it so I bought this one to use it with T-mobile but it did not work properly due to compatibilty, even though it was unlocked. I ended up returning the phone.",OK
"Short battery life and chrome doesn't work as well as the browser already loaded on the phone. Had to purchase a larger sim to get everything to work. I use family mobile BTW. Good phone for the price, but definitely disappointed in the battery.",OK
This was going to be a gift for an older relative. I read the manual before purchasing this phone. I have been a Nokia fan for many years and I was upgrading a phone for a older relative. The instructions said it was easy to transfer data from a Nokia OVI format to this windows format. Three hours on the phone with Nokia Support and many issue later it is not easy to transfer previous data with out a lot of programing. Also the Zune Software for pictures and music does not perform like the OVI. I guess it would have been better if I had started from scratch and not had such a very good previous experience. I would not recommend it as an upgrade. My relative will just stick with their previous Nokia product. I plan on returning the phone.,OK
"Screen broke so easily the first week. Fell down from a really small distance. My phone now lost all waterproof capabilities.Sony Support is the weakest point of the Brand and warranty only works by sending the phone for 15 business days (Apple replaces a screen in the same day).Video output sound distortion is finally fixed against All other Xperia phones (Z, Z1, Z2).Great phone and great looking but Sony doesn't have a customer service according to the target they have.",OK
"The shipping was rather quick (though I did pay extra for expedited), it came in a padded envelope rather than a box and without the IPhone box itself (which i don't understand as the item is listed as brand new) in addition with a charger stuffed in there, both the cable and solid wall charger which could have ended up badly. A bit more caution should have been taken in my opinion. The listing also said ""accessories"" which was false as the headphone that come with the phone were not included costing me another $32 after tax. However, when I received the phone all things seem in working order and had no issue activating it with my Verizon carrier. So far it seems to be in flawless condition visually and operationally. I shall update if anything happens with in. All and all I am happy with my purchase and will consider buying from this seller again.",OK
The cell phone is a good one but battery is a big problem for me it does not take more than 4 hours after it is fully charged. The battery is a problem and I am thinking of buying another battery but I am not sure whether it will be the same to one I already have.,OK
"Needs more embedded language options. Samsung is generally very good, just needs to be able to use in other countries.",OK
The phone does not charge 100% when on no matter how long it is plugged. The camera is not so good. it was scratched and cover a little bit broken.,OK
i Have had this phone for 8 months maybe less and its giving me problems already :( but i can say it holds alot of useful features.,OK
"Phone was ordered under ""unlocked"", but activated under tmobile previous sim and no web, picture mail and phone keeps rebooting and freezing... Refund or exchange anticipated.",OK
"Bought this for my wife since she didn't like how big my Galaxy S3 is. The phone arrived on time but the phone and instructionswere in Itailian not English. I kinda expected this since this phone isn't offered in the US. Changing the phone's language to Englishisn't difficult just mentioning it so anyone reading this is aware. The only real dissapointment I have with this phone is that thereception is not as good as my phone. We live in an area where service can be somewhat marginal, my S3 usually has at least oneor two bars but her S3 mini sometimes doesn't have any service at all.",OK
The battery _ÙÓÜ it's not staying to long as we expected from this phone as the seller said,OK
"Silliest thing since pet rock. For the price, it should have at least been assembled. Nice gag gift.",OK
"Not a new item. Came with a DESTROYED battery that wouldn't charge, boot the phone, or fit in the phone because of the bubbling.",OK
Have convoy II. Bought this as a 2nd phone for (PTT). Have had some difficulties with incoming calls. At times they dont ring thru.,OK
"The overall performance of the phone is great, also the camera.The only problem is the battery, it last for half a day not 2 days as it claims not even the whole day with average use.",OK
It is a good phone if you want to get away from the technology of the smart phone. Works well.,OK
"Nice phone, but I ran the OS update before activating and it was locked again. Unable to activate with Straight Talk. Spent plenty of time with Straight Talk CS and determined the best course of action was to return the phone. Looked at other unlocks, but ended buying a S4 mini direct from Straight Talk. A bit more money but a lot less headache, activated new phone in 5 minutes.",OK
"I'm not sure what to think of this. I thought I was buying a brand new product (the used ones are listed for less $), but after seeing that the box it came in was not the original box, and that the phone already had a screen protector on it, I am now suspicious. I am buying this phone to remplace my current one (same model) which I really love, but it has fallen too many times over the last 2 years.If this one I bought is not new, how do I know it hasn't been dropped? Can anyone recommend how to check whether this phone was already used? I have AT&T. And I paid the $269 priceThank you",OK
"The phone although in pretty good condition is obviously used, the keypad shows a lot of wear and tear and the battery cover is a different color than the rest of the phone. Bought this from Adorama Camera.",OK
Yes for the price it does the job. Not good for much but calling and texting but it works for me,OK
"works ok,gets the job done,freezes to much for my liking....takes a few seconds before it picks up a call,so you decide",OK
"there are definitely better phones out there. The windows App Store is absolutely terrible... Also the phone came as unlocked but still showed the att logo at startup, seems refurbished NOT NEW. trust me I have gone through 20+ phones in my lifetime, get over this one, it's not worth it.",OK
"Does everything I expected. Only one problem, the volume isn't very loud. Other than that I am pleased with what I received.",OK
Somewhat laggy when it comes to performance and a few runtime call glitches. It functions though and I got it at reduced cost so I'm pretty happy with the 100 I spent. If I had bought this at the $300 full price I would not be pleased at all.,OK
"This is my first venture into the Windows Phone arena. My initial high hopes three weeks ago are now replaced most days trying to decide whether I should try to stick it out or cut my losses and get an Android or iPhone.I love the look of Windows Phone's UI and the integration of your photos and contacts into almost every corner of the OS is somewhat charming.That being said the gimped Windows 7 apps (Spotify) and complete lack of some of the most popular apps from the marketplace (Pandora) make me miss the days of my iPhone 4 and even my 1st gen Android.Technically the phone lags, and the apps often crash. APN settings will work one minute then stop the next, forcing you to reset the phone.The camera on the Lumia 900 is fantastic, sadly you will be hard pressed to find a quality photo editing app in the marketplace.Overall the technical drawbacks of the Lumia 900 coupled with the now out of date Windows Phone 7 OS make it difficult for me to recommend this phone to more experienced smartphone users.",OK
First phone I received did not have a working microphone unless I had it on speaker phone. I returned the product and ordered another. Second phone works fine and is in great condition. It's not a big risk purchasing this phone because if it does not work you can just return it. It's slightly annoying you may not get a working phone at first.,OK
Pros:I feel that this Product is perfect for the price. It handles everything really nicely and even a few games. It runs surprisingly fast due to no bloatware. It is a perfect screen size and a great first phone for anyone (or junk phone for me so if I break it I don't care)Cons:Almost everything is fine the only issue I have with this phone Is that the keyboard is not that responsive and easy to misclick keys. If you are a master or fast texter don't get this phone. But if you are casual then this could be a great option for you.,OK
"The phone is alright, however the camera is deeply deceiving. I bought this predominantly for the camera and the shots in the superior auto mode or the manual have been sub par to say the least. The build quality of the phone and the performance has been exceptional. However, the phone as it is made out of glass completely is very very slippery and the enclosures become loose after a few months.If you are in the market for a small to medium sized smartphone which has decent performance, this is not the device to satisfy your needs. I was fooled, hope you see this before you buy it.",OK
Nice phone for someone that has a hard time seeing the dial pad. 1 problem I couldn't get service for this phone will not accept the sim card.This phone was a paper weight. I traded it in for a phone that does work.,OK
But its software is dated-no connection with adapter setup to smart tv- even is was asserted by samsung help.,OK
Awesome phone for the price. But doesn't wprk with SPRINT. They said it's too old :(,OK
the cell phone is not in good condition. battery not charging well and for this reason constantly goes without notice that battery is low. is there any guarantee for this damage 'because we have spent a lot of money and thought it was one of the best phones.,OK
"I love the size and speed of the phone, but the volume is extremely low when turned up as high as it will go. I have also had issues with the sensitivity of the screen and the gravity sensor doesn't work. The GPS also acts like it isn't on when it is.",OK
To be honest.. for a budget phone it's not that bad. Warning though..if you're into a good camera for your phone.. I wouldn't recommend this one. Its HUGE also lol...but I like big phones. But you absolutely can't beat the price..you get a lot,OK
"goodIt should tell you that my interest in buying the Blackberry 9650 came no headphones, memory card and USB cable.Waiting for an answer.thanks",OK
"The phone does not seem to be new. Box unsealed , the phone inside the box comes in a simple and common plastic bag , not plastic official protector that wraps around the phone, only plastic screen protector. Front camera lens with broken bottom edge (3mm). Sim pin injector bent and does not come in official protective cardPros: 2.5 not 2.3 processor, good performance, int. version.",OK
Like the phone but the GPS is not good in it keeps losing my location,OK
this phone does not hold a good battery charge and charges real slow if charged by computer the positive thing about this phone is it is rugged,OK
the product motorola razr v3xx unlocked looks good but is not to the standard as my motorola razrv3xx Loked from att it is not what I expected so I have to return it.,OK
"I know it would be a great phone , but i got a broken one so i dont know.Apple is always got so one my expirances with ipod i would recommend",OK
"Buyer beware, this phone is not warranted by Samsung. I found out the hard way after contacting Samsung with a minor issue with the back cover cracking/chipping after 10 days of use. Samsung does not warrant unlocked phones sold by third parties. This information was confirmed by the seller who told me to return it to Amazon for a refund or exchange. The warranty attached to the description is not applicable and misleading.",OK
"It was a little tricky getting my unit started. The instructions are poorly written, not just grammatically, but they keep referencing items not included with what I received (i.e., a charger, a charger base). Mine came with a computer USB cable. It synced easily to my Samsung Galaxy but stopped working. After a day of re-syncing, recharging and tweaking it is back working. Great volume and clarity. I have been unable to sync mine to ""talk & call"" so it is just works like a wireless headset with me having to initiate and end calls directly from my phone. I am going to pass this off as a gift to someone and upgrade to a Motorola Universal with more features for the same price.",OK
"Listen this is a really cool phone. Don't get me wrong. However, you cannot use with enterprise services if they require encryption. That normal standard android function is completely missing from settings (under both security and storage). Needless to say my husband is quite happy as he has a new nifty phone to play with. Sigh. Lovely screen, on screen key board worked well, acts as a tethering/highspot. Off to find a new phone for me as husband does the ""I got your phone"" dance.",OK
"I'm reviewing this product about one year later. I received a call from the seller maybe 2 weeks after I purchased to politely ask me to review it. He was a nice man. Unfortunately, either his phone of the first gen Moto X is slightly disappointing in some regards. Don't get me wrong. I love the UI and its performance for the cost. However, I notice that my phone heats up QUICKLY. I bought mine refurbished though.",OK
"Nokia 6700 SLIDE ALUMINUM Unlocked Phoneone of the equipment unlocked nokia 6700 model purchased from Amazon came through with a defect, the team lit I could not see it working or to use it. Please tell me I should be grateful that I do in this case, I am in Venezuela and would like to know Opcon I have to make a change for this team. The address where the product was sent to a family in Seattle.",OK
"It's ok. Smaller than I wanted. I had to contact seller and they responded right away. When I got phone, it came with charger, but did not charge. The phone came with other people's contact info and pictures. I had to delete and resetting phone back to original settings. The company sent me another one and it charges now. I am going to send the bad phone back. All in all, it is an okay phone, but I wish it had a bigger screen. Not very big.",OK
in the commercial it shows that this phone is unbreakable. but it fell on the floor from my hand and it cracked. totally disappointed.,OK
The previous one lasted four years in a commercial environment before it started to leak oil. Would prefer another brand but to do so would mean more holes in my door. So I settled for an identical replacement simply so the existing holes could be used. Item looks nice but the Made in China tag tells me not to expect a long life out of this one either.,OK
"The phone messes up here and there. It's a great phone for someone whose phone is messed up and about to get an upgrade. I wouldn't want this phone 6 months, can't wait to get my upgrade.",OK
"the smartphone is ok and easy to use but it does not an international use phone and it can only be used in north america,which disappointed me a lot",OK
I wish it came. With Sim card cant calk or text I can only use it as a alaem right now,OK
"UPDATE Dec. 28, 2015 - This phone was returned. Nine days after receiving it and using it, the battery stopped charging and the phone went dead. I returned it and purchased another smartphone with a different OS at a local retail store. So I cannot support the previous review any longer.No issues with the phone itself and its quality. That its a 5 star. My issue and the reason for the three stars is that, the description should have said ""Unlocked AT&T Galaxy S4"", not just ""unlocked Galaxy S4"". The phone has AT&T starting music, symbol, web browser, and all the apps that come with an ATT Galaxy and ATT contract! It took me 3 hours on the phone with MY phone provider to set the phone with THEIR network, it also took me a whole day and a whole battery to delete all that ATT stuff!",OK
I've had this phone for almost a month now and I want to let it be known that it is not perfect.. This is not the USA version of the Galaxy Mega which I discovered when looking to buy a case in my local mall.. Also my weather app has crashed and won't work..my GPS location services won't work..the phone does not seem to have the s beam feature which it should be equipped with.. And when using the search feature my phone displays chinese characters.. I do not know the cause for any of these flaws nor how to correct them. However I have enjoyed using this phone and I haven't had any problem using this phone on the straight talk network.. So overall I am satisfied with this phone but it is lacking some key features and does have its flaws,OK
Good phone but I think the speaker is going out on it and haven't had it all that long,OK
"It works but sometimes its like it turns itself off and then you miss alot of calls, but for the most it works fine.",OK
"So true. Phone was very inexpensive. I only needed it to store phone numbers and a few speed dial numbers. That's it, other than placing calls. That's what it does. Plenty of sounds so you''re not stuck with something you absolutely hate. The back falls off often and it takes a long time for the battery to charge. If you need just bare-bones-basic, then this is it. Comes with two batteries.",OK
"The only problem I find with this defender is the pretty two tone aqua color gets trashy looking because my hands get dirty at work and I have to use my phone at work . Soap & water , even a little bleach mixed in , alchohol , none of these work . Only acetone and it doesent really get it clean. I wish it came in brown . ( black is so common and I have to be different).",OK
"This is the second Mega phone I tried, the first couldn't keep a charge, so Amazon quickly sent me another. Thank you. Then after I downloaded everything to the new phone and friends started calling, they couldn't hear me although I could hear them perfectly. Could not get it resolved no matter how we tried so I had to return it. My sister has one just like it and has never had any issues, wish I could say the same.",OK
"It's a very nice and stylish cellphone but it's too expensive.The best:It allows to create VPNs and access pop mail, you can download games and some other useful apps, GPS works as promised and it's easy to use, good sound quality.The bad:It's too slow, sometimes it freezes when you receive a new message or when trying to open an application, GPS drains the battery really fast; it doesn't include a usb adapter to recharge the battery. Mobile TV doesn't work in Mexico yet.",OK
Everything about this phone is good. But the battery runs out too quickly. Sometimes it doesn't get charged. I had to remove battery and put it back to get it charged. I don't know why that is happening.,OK
"I bought this for my mom, its a really nice phone but its really fragile without a proper case and can easily crack without one due to its thiness.",OK
I love the phone itself. It has everything you would expect in today's flagship smart phone. A major flaw is that the battery life is not good. If your doing in streaming or gaming your battery will last 4hrs at best starting from 100%.,OK
the order bill its no present whit my cell phone? i need the bill for complete the order. its the one,OK
"The S5 Active is a good phone. I really liked all the features except that you couldn't change the home active screen for the apps....barometer, compass etc. I would have liked to be able to add or delete items to that screen. On that note...the DO NOT BELIEVE Samsung when they say the S5 Active is water - resistant!! IT IS NOT according to their own IP-67 rating performance standards! I am very thorough about my gear and made sure the battery case and the charger flip were properly stowed and inserted. After a quick, less than 2 minute dip in a river, less than a foot deep, it flooded. Samsung will NOT honor the warranty for ""liquid damage"". Well if the phone had performed as advertised, there would have been no damage to the phone. This phone is rain/ sweat resistant only. Don't depend on it for anything else. Samsung has a tedious warranty process as well. I was very unhappy with their customer service and I'm normally a very happy person. Buyer Beware of Samsung's false advertising.",OK
It worked fine until i took pics with it. The back camera was scratched terribly. I had to pay 30bucks to change that.,OK
"the phone performs lovely very good everything ie camera, features ou name it... but only after 9 months i now have boothloop problem. very unfortunate and makes me wonder if i should continue buying LG seeing that I was just giving it a try",OK
The phone stopped working from Day3.I have tried using all combinations to make it work nevertheless a wasted effort.,OK
First of all its not a true otterbox product. It is made in China so it's a little less durable. I had mine for two weeks then the belt clip popped off. After a little glue it's back on but it no longer swivels. But for the price it does its job.,OK
No instructions came with phone screwy how the menu is screwy hard to use but better than what I had . Comes with navagition but requires subscription and is to fat. Works ok though,OK
32G rom 3G ram but there are better. What lost the stars was a BATTERY THAT YOU CAN'T REMOVE ! ALL THE BLOATWARE APPS. CAN RUN AS LONG AS THEY WANT AND U CAN'T CUT OFF THE POWER TO THEM . UNDERSTAND NOW ?,OK
"The phone looks good except that the battery is very poor..since its new phone the power come down quickly, it's not come for even 1 day if I have full charge..",OK
"I bought this phone as my mom's first smart phone. It has the easy mode option which allows you to enlarge the icons and simply the dashboard to display only the necessities. I like the phone for that reason, but as a smart phone user, I wouldn't buy it for myself. It is so slow, and the pictures are not great either.",OK
"It's okay, it's backwards from the one we bought at Verizon, however it got soaked at an event and needed to replace.It's been acting up and we've not had it a year, so we'll get to purchase another piece of junk from a secondary source as we still have to get through our lovely contract before we can replace it with something better.**Not always as they appear!",OK
It's good phone it's big and nice but it was really complicated at the beggining. You must ACTIVATE ONLY with T-Mobile american sim card which is activate internet. But Only T-mobile american. Then you have an old android operative system. If you want the new and good aplications you slould use the new android which the phone will ask u about that. And the biggest problem is the slow telephone ever. But also if you buy from the store all over the world is same. You have programs from the market app and you can download. Also the phone has not micro SD card.,OK
"Seller vendor Breed, it was shipped sealed and brand new but I noticed the back button was very weak responsive time so I thought this will go away and been a month it's getting worse and I have to press the back button hard enough to function properly. the signal strength on samsung note 4 international is weak, in the US -104 dBm is considered 3 bars while this phone is 1 bar. and this phone claims HD voice but I do not see anywhere in the menu to locate VoLTE or HD voice. I kinda regret buying this I should have bought s7 edge but oh well. try not to buy international version as their phones not fully work in the US even LTE bands and specs are great. But good thing about international phones is that it updates firmware way ahead of time than carrier brand phones. This phone keeps showing ""Refreshing Sim Data"" while using cricket wireless i tried everything and no solutions as of now. i prolly wont keep this phone long as i have few issues showing after months go by.",OK
I ordered this case after seeing it in another color on someone else's phone. I chose this case because of the color and price. From the photo's shown it looked as if the back was a lighter purple with an ombrÌ© effect. It's not. I was slightly disappointed after opening the box to see its a solid maroon color and not purple ombrÌ© like the picture appeared it to be. I am still keeping it though since it's a great case and it was a nice price. I'd give it 4 stars for durability but I'm only giving it three since the pictures weren't completely accurate.,OK
"It's ok so far,however you need more & better instructions on how to use the watch,& set up features,on how to use its features, how to delete things put in by mistake.Longer battery life",OK
I love the phone. But they need to put that it is not compatible with 4G or lte.. the highest it goes is h+...,OK

"Great build, feels really nice with the frosted glass, but my the camera experience is terrible and buggy and just can't compete which is a shame since Sony is the manufacture of the camera in the Iphone 6s and Galaxy s7. Silky smooth skin on android is great and the best skinned version of Android, but Sony please update your camera.",OK
"Apple iPhone 6 Plus is good and meets my expectations. I love it. Unfortunately, the quality of adaptor/charger which came with the phone is poor.",OK
"The BBerry Classic is a 5 star product. The reason for the 3 star is that the price from this Seller is less than Shop Blackerry, because this product is no longer under warranty. Delivery was on time. Product looked and felt new, except for outside box. It worked perfectly before I had to return it, because I couldn't update the software to the same higher version as my existing Classic ( which means compatibility issues). So much energy was wasted with calls to Blackerry Support, hence taking time to provide this write up. The good news is the prompt refund from Amazon.",OK
"I really spent lots of time on returning of this cell phone. When I used the radio of this cell phone at the first time, the screen was crazy. Also, the screen was crazy three times when I used Youtube. I wondered whether there was something wrong with the main board of this cell phone. I asked for a return for this order. The seller didn't confirm a return and e-mailed me to contact tech. support for fixing it. After I contacted tech. support, they couldn't fix it because there is something wrong with the IMEI number of the phone. Then, I contacted seller and asked a return again. However, Seller sent me the same e-mail that I need to contact tech. support. After seller didn't give me any help, I filed a claim to Amazon. With the help from Amazon, Seller confirmed me a full refund.",OK

"I like the phone. I am still trying to get used to all the features it has to offer. The charger I was sent does not give a good charge. I get messages saying I need to use the charger that was purchased with the phone for the best charge. It looks as if it would use the same charger as my Samsung Galaxy S4, but it does not. I have lots of chargers (new) but it is impossible to get any of them to fit into the charging slot. I am not sure if this is a defect or not, but it surely is aggravating.",OK
The phone is a little awkward and takes time for even the most intuitive kids to figure out. The front face plate is just plane wierd. Phone does it's job and seems greate for kids. I personally would never buy one for me or for someone who needs their phone for more than just emergencies.,OK
"It's a great phone but it doesn't use the high speed HSPA+ or 3G, only EDGE with T-Mobile and I suppose other Providers in the US as well.",OK
My be my bad luck but the screen failed within two months - not so tough or just a bad product?,OK
"Pros; The hardware quality feels good. The screen is high resolution and bright. It is very good for reading and writing emails. Cons; feels heavy and not very comfortable to hold, call quality not as expected, the camera does not give you good quality photos.",OK
"Phone is great for the money Ca $50, except that is slow. I am Nokia user and this is slow. The simple comand given to call last number with Green phone buttom it takes min 6 sec. With my prevouse Nokias was immidiate.The writing names to phones is similar with Erricson option of picking the letter. Also waste of time and energy.This is what I don't like in this phone other than it is OK.",OK
"Receiver a faulty device, front camera would crash as soon as it opened, never showing any images, just a black screen.Awaiting replacement.",OK
"The size is cool, but ultimately this is an over-sized Galaxy S4. There is nothing special about it and even though it says it comes ""unlocked"", all the AT&T logos and apps pop up on the screen during start up and in the applications section. Had it for a 3-4 weeks, but then got rid of it as I have T-Mobile and it really is better utilized with AT&T. Got a prepaid AT&T SIM card and had better use with the phone. If you have AT&T, you will appreciate the phone more.",OK
Bought this to replace a broken Sony M2. This is an International Version. No a US version. Some of the Apps are different.,OK
"I buy a lot of phones. I really wanted to like this BLU phone-tablet. However, the RAM needs to increase to help with the multi-tasking and the freezing. Other than that it's good. But I hope they make some upgrades and I'll buy when it comes out.",OK
"My only problem is that it seems slow at times. May it's just my plan but it takes a couple seconds to get from page to page or section to section. Otherwise, it's okay as a phone.",OK
Yea bought this to replace my Bionic and hell for $20 a used phone it still works but have a problem on mine where I cannot see the sent messages and if I even press on that option the entire phone freezes up and you have to remove the battery to make it work again but other than that this phone does what its supposed to..make calls and send a message here and there. Thanks to this bad boy my phone bill is less that $15 a month!,OK
"It was bought for my Mother-in-law, and she loves it! So, thumbs up for you.. I thought no one has it in stock, but you did.. I think I'll buy other one for my Mom..",OK
"The LG enV3 is perfectly fine for what I need. Texts and phone calls. The camera is not close to what the iPhone 4 or iPhone 5. You need a data card to add music that no one mentions.If you just need a phone to stay in touch, and be able to touch, this is your baby. I actually like that it's not touch screen. It's more like typing on a laptop. All in all. If you don't need toget emails or play games on your phone (which is stupid in the first place) this is perfect. It's not exactly impressive if you're sitting at a meeting with people that all have iPhones, butthat's just a status thing. I think...don't get what you don't need. This is a perfect little phone. Almost no bells or whistles, which is what most people really need. Go for it.",OK
"Within 2 months after receiving this phone, it started going haywire. It would change the color to black and white and lines would display across the screen or it would continuously jump. When on whatsapp calls, after a while, it loses wifi, disconnects the call and changes the time to military time. I've still been able to use it by shutting down and powering up again and then it would be normal again. I contacted the seller and they advised me to return it for repair. Since I am currently overseas, I will return it in April when my husband returns to the US. Hopefully they can fix it.",OK
"Pretty good phone experience. Definitely good value for the price. The screen is fairly vibrant and responsive. Audio is good. The accessories included, good earphones and plastic case (the one case you're ever going to have), are nice. The two sim card slots in the back are good for travel.One major issue is how they partitioned the storage. Internal storage is only about 2 gb and that's all the room you will have for apps and certain data. Though you can alleviate this issue with an external SD card, the limitations of 2 gb are still rather annoying and have forced me to only have the pertinent apps and not install fun apps.Definitely recommended as a initial phone for kids/teens, back-up phone or temporary replacement, but a higher end flagship phone may be otherwise more recommended because of its one flaw.",OK
"The phone is UAE (United Arab Emirates) version of the phone.It's unlocked manually using unofficial unlock method (not by Samsung). They also put it in developer mode.Other then that, the device is OK. I just hope the ""unlocking method"" used and phone origin will not create a problems later when updating to newer firmware etc.",OK
"Changed from the Blu studio 7. The tactile feel of the screen is less pleasing than on previous phones, and the touchscreen is much less responsive than on other devices. I prefer the rainbow accessibility feature of the kit Kat 4.4 as well as the contacts software accompanying that software version.",OK
"The key on the back did not open completely, so it does not come off like it should.Now the front screen shows black, this happened 2 days ago.",OK
"though i know little about BB, this device is not as good as i have hoped. but the price, only can get a refurnished one with Orange Logo... With more budget, I will definitely try to get a totally new and new-style BB.",OK
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",OK
I was unable to use the phone at first because the battery died. I had to purchase a new batter otherwise it works fine.,OK
"It seems well built, but it has no upgrade available to kitkat. Cyanogenmod doesn't support this particular model. The Blu version of jellybean included seems a bit restrictive.",OK
Needed a phone to use since I washed mine. This one served to fill in the gap until I could buy what I wanted.,OK
"The hardware is good and in good condition for a used phone. The OS is Windows 10 and it's horrible. It takes 3x the processing time to open up apps and the phone is super slow. If you buy this phone, get the Windows 8.1 OS.",OK
"Would have like to have given this less stars, but I wont. I expected this phone to have 4G but it DOESN'T HAVE IT, but not reading into it carefully is my fault. I do wish it said it does not have 4G capabilities in the title or description but it didn't. If you buy this phone at any T mobile store or any like store it comes with 4G. Luckily the person I bought this phone for doesn't mind. It is a powerful smartphone and does everything you want it to do.",OK
My back camera stop working da first day i got it.... N I forgot it has no flash on it camera sucks,OK
It's a good phone. Just didn't like the fact that everything came in korean language. The specifications of the box and the manual is in korean. Even the phone's default language is korean,OK
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,OK
"The version of the BlackBerry 8520 phone to request international version does not bring the Spanish option, just bring the English language. I can not make calls because neither hear nor did I hear and does not bring a manual in several languages. The letter ""M"" sticks. That unfortunate to lose my money",OK
"Unfortunately, the case didn't last very long. Loved the concept, but it broke after a few months.",OK
"Doesn't have the best internal storage, camera isn't the best and when you double tap the screen it magnifies the screen. Otherwise it's a pretty decent phone. Been using it for a couple month now. I haven't had any problems with it. Dropped it a couple times pretty hard and it's pretty durable just a couple scuff marks.",OK
"Very fast shipping, product as described. Package come with promotion credit. Good purchased.Used after 15days, this unit works well with normal web browsing, whatsapp, Wechat but does not work with VOIP application.Problem may be come from local provider [ in Toronto , Canada ], user who need to use VOIP application, do not buy this model.",OK
"Ok, typical technology of a BB phone, make his work, not comparable with an iphone, but solid smartphone this one",OK
"It's a Sony Xperia Z2 with a camera that is sub par to my ZL model which has lesser megapixels....colors are not as good(true), specially in darker settings(after sunset).....and to make things more challenging, the new lollipop is also sub par to KitKat in my opinion. Screen is a HUGE improvement....much clearer and brighter for outside use....boy....what a difference....Rest is alright.....after all.....it is primarily a cellphone, and it does make calls eh..eh..eh...hope this helps......camera's flash is also dimmer than my ZL model.....sheesh.......(just so you know.....I still haven't swapped my ZL for this one....I'm giving this one as a gift to probably to one of my kids.....",OK
"I'm not sure what was wrong with this unit, but its memory was almost completely full, and I wasn't able to delete anything to make more space. AT&T said I needed a memory card, which fixed the problem. Everything works OK now.",OK
"The phone is OK at best, the camera and processor is performing better than any phone i can find at this price but the push notifications and band support for tmobile and att&t gives this phone a terrible reception for rural areas, needs alot of fixing if this phone will be put up at the top ranks",OK
Very fast phone but heats too much. I recommend everybody to monitorize CPU temperature. With some apps it reaches 75å¡C!!!,OK
"The iPhone itself is amazing, but the battery does not last half a day. I can't trust it to be available if needed in an emergency due to battery life. I did some checking and it turned out the battery had over 700 recharge cycles, which means the phone had been used for over two years. If possible, do not buy refurbished.",OK
The phone is very small. It makes beeps like I'm getting another call when I'm trying to talk on it and it makes hang up sounds and I can hear a dial tone while talking so I think I have dropped the call but the other person on the phone (the other caller) says he/she doesn't hear it. I have contacted At&t (my service provider) about it and they say it isn't them; it's my phone!!! So that really stinks!!! It's fine though for the money. ????,OK
"Great value. Really good phone unless you drop it...which you will, and there is no where to go to get it fixed. I ordered a new screen and digitizer which didn't work. So now I have a worthless hunk of plastic and metal.",OK
"I ordered this as a replacement for a, I can't even use the words here, ATT GoPhone. The touch screen is nice, and it's super touchy to use. The slide function for the keyboard is good, but I have a hard time texting with the letters spaced so far apart. I also have to press down hard to type and end up making a large deal of errors while texting. My texting speed has also slowed down.However, for the cost, it's a good replacement. The bluetooth feature works well for my hands free system in my car. I don't use any other features on the phone, just talk, text, and voicemail.",OK
"it was a refurbished phone, it's unlocked and works OK. i wish they could be more clear and say the phone is refurbished.",OK
"I really wanted to give a good review of this phone. I love the sleek look of this device. And, the bold purple really stands out as different. Not to mention the great camera, and 3GBs of ram that keeps apps moving snappily. Thats the good, but the bad is this thing is constantly overheating.I wish I could keep it, but this thing is constantly overheating. I can literally feel the heat coming of the phone. Even when I'm not putting it to heavy usage (i.e. using the camera, watching videos, playing games) the phone is still noticeably warm.",OK
"I purchased this phone in May 2009 and really liked the features of this phone: the keyboard, clear screen, ability to get an additional battery, additional memory chip and small size. I was able to use this phone for work and personal e-mail without major problems for about a year. Unfortunately, about thirteen months after I got the E71, it started rebooting randomly. Finally last month, on a business trip to San Diego, it began to reboot constantly, rendering it virtually unusable. I tried reseting the device without any change. I looked up some posts on the internets and some thought it was related to the AT&T network in certain areas. Perhaps it was a conflict with my Jawbone bluetooth or other software I had installed. Regardless, I could no longer depend on the phone since I will be working quite a bit in the San Diego area so, I joined the rest of my family and switched over to the iphone 4.",OK
"I am not so please about this phone, the screen is not lighting up when am in calls every minute I have to reboot and restart, the screen is sticking, am not please.Also my apps are not responding I have to disable and uninstall then reinstall I honestly don't want this phone and would like a refund!",OK
It will do till we have an upgrade ready. Didn't realize it does not have a flashlight and that is my husband's favorite feature. Does not hold a charge for very long.,OK
i know samsung battery is not thaaaat good compared to others but this device has a 3300 mAh battery (!!!!) it was supposed to be a really good one. it was getting super hot at first and i was like wtf. anyway it's ok now and i really love it. oh! the calender keeps crashing :/ actually it never worked. so im giving 3 stars.,OK
"The JUNING (TM) 5.5, has a lot of features that I like, such as the ability to record the songs on the radio and save for future playback, handy when I workout. What I do not like about this phone is that it freezes on a black screen from time to time, and when typing texts the touch screen will pick the letter next to the one being selected, making texting difficult. This does not happen often but often enough that it is worth mentioning. This JUNING 5.5 will also reset the wallpaper at random, it seems to prefer the stock wallpaper and will keep resetting the wallpaper if you apply a live wallpaper from app. The JUNING 5.5 also drops calls frequently and disconnects from bluetooth ear piece constantly. I am thinking seriously of exchanging it for another phone with similar features.",OK
This didn't come with a charger and we ordered one and it still doesnt work. My advice go to a store and get a new one.,OK
it dident work for me. if you buy a unlocked phone that dont come from the usa not everything will work on it. i really like the razr wish they woud start making them again.ps the phone is not made in the usa its were it was first set up that will cause the proublem.,OK
Not to many apps are created for this os. Better get a Windows 8 or higher,OK
will freeze up and send text messages over and over. screen sometimes will not respond when touched. if slide open for keyboard the screen will go black and not work and have to power it down and leave off for awhile.,OK
I adore the phone but three things that's very depressing:-1). BATTERY!!! - it goes down to quickly while in use - i hate that!!! and my in use period is not excessive2) OVERHEATS!! - am not sure if am the only one experiencing this problem but this baby gets hot ALOT!!!!3) CAMERA!! - its good sometimes and the stability which i read and viewed videos about is not as effective. Regarding the general settings of the camera just maybe i have to fiddle with it to get the expected resultsOutside the 3 above its a really nice phone but because of those three issues am having second thoughts to be honest,OK
Recommended for basic funtions. Not a super phone. Looks good but the battery doesn't last.,OK
I don't know if it is software or hardware problem but the battery drains pretty fast and the phones heats a lot.,OK
"The phone at first works fine and I was happy with the phone and the battery lasts for 2 days. After 9 months, the battery is not holding even after closing apps and I have to charge it 1-2 times a day.I don't know whether the battery performance will degrade after more usage.Worst, I cannot replace the battery in the phone.However the phone works great.",OK
I'd like to believe I'm a good reader with good comprehension but the beginning of this book seemed like it was geared to another phone. The instructions didn't match the make and model of the phone. Later on the book became accurate. Fortunately I didn't need the beginning.,OK
Purchased 2 phones for 2 friends that live out of country. One phones camera didn't work at all....that's what ya get you buy on the Internet!!! Never again.,OK
I'm pretty sure this was not new. The description was not clear and I think it's a little deceptive.The phone is also tuned for AT&T. You can still use other SIM cards but there are annoying AT&T apps that are not easily removed.,OK
I bought this for my mom. She had a smartphone but didn't like it. She loves this phone and it isn't in to bad of condition. It can be a little glitchy at times and had also turned off for no reason a couple times. The charging port is very loose and that could be reason it randomly turns off. It is a used phone and I dont think I would get another one.,OK
"So I was really excited about this phone. Really good reviews. 68% positive which is about the same as the Samsung galaxy S7. The same specs, solid body. Metal. Felt like a Nokia. Ssuuper fast OS, great pics, great screen. The one flaw my phone had and its major is that it would not connect to the internet. Calls? check. Text? check. Internet? no. I tried to set the APN which is not hard. Got nothing. Took it to ATT , my carrier, Nothing. They couldn't understand why it would not connect. So I jut put in for a return. Will drop off at UPS tomorrow. Really wanted to like this phone, at $200 it would have been a steal. But the internet issue killed it for me. Sorry BLU. I got a Galaxy S7 in stead.",OK
"The article says it is version does not bring international and Spanish language to change, raises 4G and neither does, up to 3G and H, samsung products have previous versions and if they raise 4G.",OK
Delivery was on time. Phone works fine except that when I plugged it in to charge it the touch screen stopped working. I had to turn it off a few times until it started working again. It seemd used because it had some contacts in the Blackberry Messneger.,OK
Too many scratches on the outer coverpone had a tecnical problem ... is switching the speaker to headphones without have headphons plugged in,OK
"The phone works very well. It is fast and responsive but the main problem is phone is taking very long time to charge but gets discharged very quickly even if you don't use he phone which concerns me, thanks.",OK
"The phone is pretty, takes good photos, has a nice display, good call quality, and is very lightweight. However mine three months in has begun to freeze multiple times a day (touching the screen does nothing and I often have to reboot). That is very frustrating and it makes the phone feel like a bad bargain instead of a good one.",OK
This phone took two months intell it started to miss up the phone itself looks nice but it gets hot fast it started to make calls by itself and apps would just open by there self it pisses me off bad that It does this I wish I can get my money back.,OK
"Phone was exactly what was in description, but this phone has very bad battery life! Would recommend the other droids.",OK
"I bought this phone expecting a good quality phone; however, it has been a disappointment. I have had the phone for about 4 weeks & have had to charge the battery about every 4-5 days. The real problem happened this morning when I tried to plug in the car charger. It did not make contact. No charging was going on. When I got to work, I pulled out the home/office charger I had been using all along & it too did not make contact. No charging was going on. I checked the slot in the phone & it had shifted on one side so that now I am unable to recharge the battery. Very disappointing. Time to file a complaint with then seller.",OK
"Good article, good balidad of materials and design, software upgradeable, does not meet the needs of today usuariosde, but it is useful for people who would use it only for workBuen articulo, buena balidad de materiales y diseÌ±o, software mejorable, no se ajusta a las necesidades de los usuariosde hoy en dia, pero es util para personas que lo utilizarian solo para trabajo",OK
"Hello good day friend, I communicate with you on this opportunity to ask for the samsung s3 mini to buy him, it asks me to encerder ingrece says a code of reconocimiendo pim sim network??? which is concerned not with the chip card pim but will not work the cell is locked and I saw that is orange and I released pedi please confirms my doubts I can hardly thank you very much and good day.",OK
"I am a S3 owner. I decided to switch to Moto G given performace issues with my current phone, It is almost unusuable (do not take me wrong, S3 is an excellent phone, just that I had high expectations of this high end phone that they weren't totally achieved). I hope to have a better performance with Moto G as a result of the pure Android OS.I haven't received the phone yet so I can give a proper review (I am pretty sure it will be a great phone). However, my complaint is that it is stated that the PHONE IS 4G UNIVERSAL..... why it doesn't work with Band 3 (used in Venezuela)?. I realized this after the pre-order.You can't say ""UNIVERSAL"" when it is actually far from that. Aware overseas buyer of this.It will work in the US with no problem. But if you travel to Europe, Africa or Venezuela, 4G won't work.It could have been totaly UNIVERSAL if Motorola would want so.",OK
it quit working 2 weeks after I purchased it. worked good while it worked....I liked it ...then the screen froze.,OK
this is a US version with missing 3g capabilities in other parts of the world. look for one with the RM-133 for a better product.other than that the phone's great and i had no issues with it,OK
Although its some years old still a great phone. In comparison to the new phones these days its a bit on the bulky (heavy) side.,OK
"the phone is new like the description, but the front camera issue and can't use properly.thanks to Amazon and 360 mobile solutions for this withdraw.",OK
It lags out and overheats a bit but its a decent phone if you are not a heavy user like me,OK
This was a gift so I have no idea how the phone worked for the recipient.,OK
I love to have unlocked phone so that i can used it international but what i get was not like that.,OK
I didn't read the fine print it's not USD it's all in Chinese I'm going to have to send it back,OK
"I ran into a serious problem with the service of the phone a few weeks after getting it. I contacted my carrier, checked if everything was good. Switched my sim and the problem wouldnt resolve. So i went to apple and the phone itself had a defect that made it so the phones gps antenna wouldnt work, which was the reason why i wouldnt get any signal what so ever. I got a free replacement. If youre buying the phone full price i suggest buying ir from Apple directly.",OK
"Hardware is very well made, but software (=Android) became barely usable (slow) after 6 month of use",OK
needs battery with White Moisture strip = battery that came with phone pour. Only have voice & mail. Miss the flip phone= T moble,OK
"i don't know i'm not using it is going overseas, i can't really tell;that's why i can not rated this phone. I'm sorry this not the phone that is going overseas; bad news about it as a matter of fact i'm sending this phone back to the seller; i bought this phone new but it's a disappointment.SAMSUNG GALAXY S 5360",OK
Not what I had expected. Has hole in the back for the Apple symbol. I was expecting higher grade with a complete full wrap around.,OK
"The phone came on time , but had reception as well as calling issues, despite two other phones working perfectly of different brand at the same location. Amazon was prompt enough to provide me refund.",OK
"Nice phone for the price, if it works properly. I took it to Europe, purchased a sim card with a data plan and hoped all will be good. But.. anywhere with not 100% or poor reception it keeps rebooting. Not just dropped calls, but shutting down while you are tweaking the settings, typing a message, browsing etc. It does this like 8 times in a row, so you can't get back to where you started. Annoying as hell.Also, started getting some buzzing while on the phone, sounds like some parts inside are lose or making noise.Volume - would like to make it louder, but there are not many options - even if you get to the ""test"" settings, it will still be not as loud as I would prefer.P.S. this is truly international version, with 3G working on european frequencies wherever 3G is available.",OK
The glider doesn't last long when you have a nervous habit of sliding it back and forth.,OK
Decent case. However upon taking phone out of case to clean the side piece now lose and moves but still works just really annoying,OK
"Phone works ok, however the screen is unresponsive when plugged into the charger. When the charger is unplugged the screen response to touch.",OK
Great phone but it came with a couple of dead pixels right in the center of the screen. I've never run into dead pixels on a phone before. Returned and waiting for another.,OK
"the battery life is low, no good wi fi , would like to send it back and upgrade or get my money back. Thanks",OK
Works just fine. A little sensitive on the screen. Stays charged for a day or two,OK
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS A GIFT FOR MY MOTHER. I ORDERED IT IN BLACK AND RECEIVED A BLUE PHONE. THIS IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT AS MY MOTHER LOVES A NOKIA FLIP.,OK
Bought for an international user. It was doing some funky automatic volume thing where the ringer volume kept going down without being touched. The camera is not the best either. But its good for the money I guess.,OK
"This one doesn't work with T mobile. I bought it, it is a great phone. However, with the T mobile sim card in it. I can only text and make phone calls, I can't use the data.",OK
Received the phone in good conditions as it stated on their site. I have not problems with the phone it has been running great.,OK
"I have had the phone for a couple weeks now and am only giving it 3 stars. I wish the phone ear speaker was louder when on calls. I can barely hear some people and it can't be turned up any louder. My biggest complaint though is that the phone keeps dropping in and out of wifi at home and work. I have no problems with my other devices consistently staying on my wifi. Frustrating. I have contacted the support line on this issue. no response back yet.Other than that, speed is good. no lag.",OK
doesn't work as well as I expected. It will not sync to my phone which is a Samsung Galaxy 6. Unable to correct the time or anything else,OK
"Good slim phone, very stylish. The only problems I can address is the small storage capacity and the speakers when trying to play YouTube or music only utilizes the bottom speaker near where you talk.",OK
The telephone woks fine but it wasn't new. It had many programs alredy install and erased. The Message in the most used app's such as BBM and whatsapp were to reinstall. The back cover was not in great condition.,OK
For the price you can't beat it. However the international phones do not support wifi calling nor does it support android pay. So it's up to you if those are deal breakers to you,OK
"I got it earlier than expected, but it didn't come with a charger like it said .",OK
This phone has a large screen on which you can enjoy multimedia content excellently. It has all the functions of a smartphone with a tablet size. Overall very good device for the price it costs. But overall performance leaves much to be desired. It is very slow. Overall I recommended if you're not going to give a very intensive use.,OK
"I love everything about this phone except for the fact that it won't open text photos. I use a straight talk sim on AT&T, signal is always full bars, 4g works great and Wi-Fi connection is instant. I have been through all APN settings, I have used third party apps and internet for help. I used the Blu Studio 5.0 C with no problems, sending this one back and getting another phone.",OK
"I just switched from a Nokia 2710i Navigator to the Nokia C6 just because the 2710i Navigator, which I bought on a trip to Germany, does not support Wi-Fi access. I tried for hours loading some MP3 songs to the phone via Ovi Suite. In my last attempt I finally shut down the phone, connected again and suddenly it worked. I was loading also some Maps and was surprised, that after some 10 maps the 2GB memory card was almost full. When I checked the sizes of the maps I noticed, that the C6 maps consume almost ten times as much as the same maps for my 2710i. So keep in mind that you might need to buy a bigger memory card. With the 2GB card you are quickly running out of memory.After all I have the impression, that beside the wireless access, the C6 does not offer much more functions as my old 2710i.",OK
"The clip on this one isn't as 'tight' as I would like (I fear it will break), but it is the exact replacement that I originally had.",OK
"Very sluggish performance and a lot of random restarts. Also, during some calls it cuts my voice off, even though its not muted. However, it is a budget phone and provides the basics. Besides talk, the messaging and other apps work ok, including the GPS Maps app.Overall, not my first choice but it is cheap, its unlocked, works in other countries with GSM frequency.",OK
"Great phone, fast and timely shipping. the only downside to this product was that when i got it, the lock button stuck so i have to press really hard to get it to lock and unlock.",OK
LOOKED LIKE A STURDY PHONE WITH ALL THE FEATURES WE NEEDED. LAST MINUTE OUR PHONE CO BACKED OUT OF ENDORSING AND COVERING THIS PHONE. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE RETURN,OK
"I loved the look of the phone, how it felt in my hands, however, it had an issue with the camera. Every time I would take a picture the phone would turn off on it's own.",OK
"Seemed to be an OK phone, but way behind the s4 I planned on replacing.",OK
"it got so hot and the screen will not rotate. had to return it. nice phone though, put all the blame to Samsung for dont know how to fix their own problem.",OK
"It came without 2gb sd card :S shipped in 1 day, phone is good, love keybord but battery life is too short , has no internal memory.",OK
This is a very nice phone but as another reviewer stated it does not have 4G LTE capabilities. This is very misleading for buyers and this is why I gave it 3 stars. It only goes up to a H signal bar.,OK
"I bought this phone simply because it was cheap and I needed a phone ASAP when my other one was about to die. It is pretty simple to use and pretty basic all around, but it was too basic for me and I decided to spend a little more on another phone with more features.Note: This particular phone was released for the German market; (which I knew upon purchase) So, you must go in the controls to change it to English function and there is no American plug outlet.It's a good phone for someone looking for an entry-level ""smarter"" phone. It's easy to use and cheap.",OK
"Like the phone itself But the battery life is real short.Mostly 3g picked up in our area, Would by another HTC phone in future",OK
I feel like the charge I get off of this lasts like the charges you get off of a car or battery pack. My charging port is faulty so I can't use a regular charger any more. The best bet with this device is to drain your battery and charge completely while the device is off. Partial charges are next to useless.,OK
"I tried ordering a case to go with the phone but you had old info on a lost credit card so every thing got messed up. I tried to correct the problem but never got the case. My phone is very cool and I like it alot, I'm Mr Mullan.",OK
"Good but the charger is unusable .it is very brand new phone as expected but I can,t use the charger",OK
"I purchased this cellphone from the seller BREED and they only have the AT&T version, the cellphone was working ok, but is not the international version, so be aware that it does not have 3G 900 frequency, so in some companies the 3G it won‰Ûªt work, so there, from the seller BREED is not the international version.They are going to give me my refund if i send the cellphone back, so no hard feelings :)",OK
"I love this phone: small enough, great feel, great software. Great sound quality. Love the wi-fi. Does take a bit of savvy to understand the menu options, but I dont mind that.But the thing that bugs me :The speaker volume isnt loud enough!! Whether I have it on handset mode or loudspeaker mode, I just cant hear the other person well enough!! Even my old piece-of-junk cheap samsung is louder than this! I'm surprised such a basic feature is bad..",OK
"Los Pros: Buen telefono, bastante personalizable, diseÌ±o anatÌ_mico, pueden descargarse muchas aplicaciones para sacar aun mas provecho del equipo, la pantalla tiene buena sensibilidad, la camara es excelente y tambien la calidad del sonido al reproducir musica, el precio es accesible.Los Contras: No trae un instrumento para maniobrar en la pantalla (lÌÁpiz o stylus), a veces se congela cuando se utiliza mas de una aplicacion al mismo tiempo, no muestra las fotos de los contactos cuando se recibe un mensaje de texto y no se puede insertar datos como numeros o datos a un msj de texto sin necesidad de adjuntar o crear una tarjeta de negocios como se hace con el 5300.",OK
It will break easily. It is a good phone when you need something small and you don't want to carry anything bulky.,OK
"I didn't know about a battery defect until the phone came, and it shuts down at random times! Other then that, I haven't had any bad luck with it.",OK
hey frnds i recommend this cell phone..nice HTC product...but when u buy than search on other site also some time distributor price is more than other distributor...,OK
"This Phone is good, runs fine and dandy, BUT I have a problem with the wall charger that came with mine, the moment I plug it in it makes an ""electric buzzing"" sound which I don't like one bit, so I have to buy a wall charger now I don't like to charge my phones using my PC, all in all the phone is good and runs fine in Venezuela with movistar, is a shame that the charger seems to be broken.",OK
"this iphone looks good, but headphone is a cheap copy. i like this iphone, but i hate this headphone. anyway headphone is not too necessary for me",OK
"really liked the phone but it is kind of slow and when I go on the internet, it takes awhile to download",OK
"Just received the phone and have not used it enough yet to review everything. The phone itself should be great, had good reviews on the web. I gave it four stars because of these things:1- It's made in china.2- You need to have nails to open the battery cover. You need to push and hold down the release then pull off the cover using other finger's nail. I hate that3- It does not have US English.4- It's not a US version neither a European version. It's Asian version.It has all Asian languages, but no US English or European language.5- it does not pick up 4G on tmobile, just 3G.Update: I gave it first time 4 stars, now giving it only 3 stars because HTC is not supporting this phone anymore. The last software update to android 4.0.3 was back in december 2012, now the jelly bean 4.2.2 is out there but HTC says that the sensation xe is not getting it. Why? no answers.What I'm doing? switching to Samsung!!!HTC you loosing customers just like that...",OK
"It's an amazing machine on its own world.But my only concern is still my inability to download from the apps the bbm app for android fone to allow me connects to the platform . However, so fat so good.",OK
"I just received this phone today and was quite excited until I was looking at the instructions that said insert sim cards before using phone, unfortunately there were no sim cards in the package. What's us with that? Were they supposed to be included, and if not, why was that information not included? I paid extra to have the 2 GIG RAM, and 16 GIG memory. Is that what there is without the SIM cards? It is all very unclear. Please advise?",OK
"It's the cutest little phone you'll ever see/hold. While it is possible to use it for literally everything a much larger smartphone can do, it runs an old OS and texting on the tiny keyboard is nearly impossible. I was walking around running errands, and I simply was not able to walk and use my phone at the same time; I had to stop and type verrrrrry carefully to do anything from text to check the map. I'm very sad to say i returned it after one week. To be fair, this may be in part because I went from using an iPhone to this; maybe a little to much change at once!",OK
"The charging cord was defective, I had to replace it. The phone never charged with the cord that came with it.",OK
No doubt this is plenty of phone for the cost. However I have already had to have it replaced. It would not boot past the BLU logo screen. It was not a month old. I like the phone and hope that was just a fluke.,OK
The first one I bought was great. I put my work badge in it and it worked great. After about 6 months it broke and I purchased a second one and it didn't last a month.,OK
This phone says its a 4G but only operates are 3G CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHY?,OK
"At the time I bought this, no other phone provided dual-sim capabilities and the quality/performance of this one.For the price was one of the best deals, but has its caveats. As some other users have reported, the USB port gets broken with use, so you'll end up with a phone you cannot charge or connect to your computer, and you'll need another identical phone or and external charger to charge the battery.On the good side, performance is good, screen quality is surprisingly good and accepts 64GB SD cards.",OK
You can't watch YouTube videos on this phone but other than that it's a good phone,OK
"Great watch and concept but for some reason, my husband and I cannot call the watch although we are the two guardian numbers on that number. A work around for this is to have the watch call us when we need it but we would love to be able to call it directly...",OK
"Not sure how I feel about this phone. I usually get Samsung brand and decided to give Blu a whirl since my husband loves his. All in all its set up really nice. Everything is simple to find and easily accessible. It lags a little bit in apps but not much and not constantly. The cameras are excellent! That was my big draw to it, so there's a win. But the storage is absolutely terrible. I've never had an issue with storage on any phone before, but I had to delete apps that came on it and about 400 photos from my SD card in order to operate it. Otherwise, it's a decent phone.",OK
"I got it right. Beautiful phone. It works well unlocked in Argentina. But it didnt come with earphones, and i didnt know it. It was supossed to be like that or i didn't get mines???",OK
"I loved it when it first came , kinda took alil long but when I started using it , it started action up , the screen would turn blue & just turn off and it won't start up unless it wants to , I had a whole day without a phone until I plugged in the charger _Ùªã",OK
Actually. My fault I said 3. I ordered the wrong phone. Customer service is a 10.,OK
"The phone is fine. It's a basic phone. It worked for about 2 months and then the phone just stopped charging. I used another charger that was compatible with the phone and it again did not charge. The battery was dead. In 3 months time, the battery died. This is unacceptable to me. Thankfully we had an old phone in the house and I was able to switch out the batteries and now it works fine again. Beware of old batteries when you buy from this seller!",OK
the problem with this phone is the battery doesnt hold a charge. Always keep it as fully charged as possible.,OK
"very good and huge phone for the amount. Worth buying. Set up was good and fast. Only problem was with my sims card it was to small, but once I took the phone to the mobile store they were able to fix that problem and the phone work excellent. One major con is the phone has no flash for the camera huge no no.....Will need to order another phone",OK
"Love this phone ,but for some reason it came without the camera chip inside.I had to use the one from my old phone in left to take pictures.Not understand why such a great phone would not have the picture chip with phone.",OK
"For some reason the charger port keeps breaking off. Idk why, I didn't drop it. This is the 2nd one I bought because the other charger port broke and my phone was not running correctly",OK
So far I am loving this phone. Nice rich colors. NIce to see in sunlight. I like all the features. The buttons on the back do not bother me and that was the one thing I didn't like when researching the phone. I love the look and feel of the phone. It's a nice size; not too small but not super huge. Takes great pictures/video. Plenty of storage in my opinion. So far I havent found anything I don't like. My only issue is the usb cord does not want to stay plugged into the phone It's very touch and if knocked will fall out I may be buying a new cord. My son wants the same phone now so we will be ordering a second one.2/15/16 I have had phone a few weeks now and i dontvlikecrhe fact thevphone gets really hot and its almostctoo hot to even use. I alao had to orderca replacement charger as the one that came with ph would not stay connected.bbi am disappointed in how hotvthe ph gets. Not confident its going to last.,OK
"I waited for so long to upgrade my BB Torch. But sadly, this was just too big for me to operate with 1 hand :(Also, i was disappointed that the apps market didn't improve as i had expected with the addition of Amazon apps. No Google Voice, Hulu or Netflix etc.",OK
Over all the phone was very nice...My friends have Samsung and even they was impressed by this phone.However I took it to Metro and the phone would not recognize the system so I wasn't able to active it..,OK
"Not bad ... packaging could have been a little better, but overall good purchase. Worked as expected ... thanks",OK
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",OK
"Good reception, good photos, but the headset does not fit well. Anyway I have audio problemsso it is not much use. Thank you for attention",OK
"Worked as I needed it too for the purpose of a phone, eventually switched to a non counterfeit brand once I had the money. Gave this phone to a friend for them to use internationally.",OK
"No android updates, not supported. Great phone otherwise, simple functions weren't possible and it was a cheap phone as well. But it is like 140 dollars anyways, so it is a great value for people who don't care about the little things.",OK
"I loved the shape of the device. But I'm desapointed because the phone doesn't have language features, and more over it can not be unlocked in order to used by other networks than T-Mobile.",OK
"Good as a tablet, but could never get it to work as a phone. As a matter of fact had to take it to a repair shop to get my sim card out of it Cruz the ""phablet"" are the dang thing",OK
"It's a decent for the price.. I've had this one for more than 6 months. The cons are 1) I am pretty frequently unable to connect to the internet using my home WIFI or my carrier. The connection is slow when I'm able to connect. 2) the phone randomly changes settings, including the merging of several contact's phone numbers onto one contact's name. And finally 4) the selfie camera is awful. Pros 1) it does everything else I'd expect a smart phone to do and 2) it does have Google play",OK
"The phone I love but the charger is broke, I went to charge the phone and it would not charge and it has something rattling inside it so now i must get a new charger, which is disappointing.",OK
"In general not a bad phone. Nice screen size and quality. Perhaps a tad heavy. Enough juice in the battery for one day use. Do not forget to charge regularly. Volume controls are not very responsive and opening and closing the phone to replace/insert SIM, MicroSD, and/or battery is a nuisance as the plastic covers are difficult to use.Rooting/unlocking the phone is not too complicated apart from the challenge to enter HBOOT mode requiring powering on while holding the volume-down button. The volume button is extremely unresponsive and I probably had to boot 25 times before being successful.",OK
"There are some touch screen issues and lighting issues. However, for the price I paid I suppose I can't complain.",OK
Well I liked the phone but it wont keep a charge so I to spend another [...] bucks to order a battery on line. I don't know if the battery I ordered is any good. I think its some kind of conspiricy to get more money out your pocket I guess times are really hard. Other than that the phone really worked great.,OK
"I am truly upset with this phone. Like any good buyer I spent countless weeks researching and debating which phone to get. Finally I saw this great deal of a phone on Amazon and was sold instantly. I couldn't wait, and when it came I had high hopes. To my dismay the call quality is poor, very poor, almost non-existent. All the other phone features worked great, except the one that mattered the most, the phone aspect, calling and talking. I hear other people fine, but they say I fade in and out and a lot of the time end up with a bad phone call because of the argument between me and the caller. I am hoping by christmas to get a bluetooth earpiece to help the quality because after that, my only other option is to try and get another phone. In the end, just a disappointment.",OK
The phone is amazing and all except the information is misleading. If you are a T-Mobile carrier DO NOT GET THIS PHONE! You will be unsatisfied because the fastest internet they provide is only 2g although the information says it goes up to 4g lte. Unless you have AT&T or do not care about the internet speed then again DO NOT GET THIS PHONE! They do not provide full detail information. Very ambiguous,OK
"cannot keep GPS location so you cannot use navigation, it will not update the weather even if it says to every hour, and when you do don't expect it to be right.battery last a long time 2 days at least. its great for calls, internet, and texting. that's it",OK
Phone is extremely rugged and feels good in your hand. It is nice to get away from delicate smartphones. Overall I like this phone but it seems to struggle with maintaining a good connection compared to other NON smartphones. I had to stop using it because I couldn't ever understand people when making calls because the connection was always weak. This may have to do with where I live but other phones on the same network work fine.,OK
It worked well for 1 year. Now it is switched off and never getting switched on. I am not sure about the problem,OK
Good basic phone. Very easy to use and came with charger as specified. Glad it did as this phone uses mini usb for charging. I'm deducting 2 stars for 2 battery issues. Number one the battery has water damage and the water indicator isn't pink but red so it's not like it came from humidity. Additionally the battery is bad/bulging and finding an actual oem that isn't fake is proving a bit harder than expected. I didn't expect a bad battery when purchasing but for a cheap phone replacement not too bad.,OK
"The phone was in better than expected shape for a refurb. The accessories were not Samsung. Just some off-beaten, dollar store brand. I ended up returning it because of software and hardware issues that could not be fixed here and was covered under the warranty.",OK
"The product was fully functional, it had minor scratches as would be expected from a used phone. However, the charger that came with it was not a blackberry charger and did not work. I need a charger.",OK
Had a hard time trying to get it to register with Straight Talk - ended up returning it.,OK
"Firstly the phone is very thin which is a plus for me, the only problem is that the battery lasts just about one day after average use. I was a bit disappointed with one aspect of the phone, from the pictures I viewed on Amazon.com it indicated that the phone was factory unlocked however when I received the phone it was branded T-mobile. Other than that the phone is great, it has an on board memory of 6GB as well as the keypad makes for easy typing.",OK
"El telefono es estupendo la camara es unica el unico problema es que se me apaga y al apagarse se le colocan unas rayas en la pantalla por lo cual debo mandarlo a reparar ,el sonido es garantizado devolverlo seria perder la compra lastima que presenta este problema.",OK
"Its OK for the price you are paying. It's too slow and camera take normal pics, it's good to carry because of the size and you can download all your apps normally. Sometimes the sound is not good and you have to use the speaker mode.",OK
The products were fair enough but were not up to expectation. I will love if they can improve on it,OK
"This was a decent phone while I had it. The phone is a comfortable size and weight, and the keyboard was pleasant to use. However it did have some glitches in the software which would cause it to freeze on occasion or would make the phone restart.",OK
"i buy this in dicember and for problems, i get it in april recently, it wasnt unlock... and only i got was cellphone and chargerd with some scars and division of keyboard broken...",OK
10 minutes in use the phone kept shutting off and rebooting itself...has been rebooting randomly through out the days....sucks when you have a nice long text written and it doesn't save it....but over all for $54....no biggie...my expectations after reading the reviews were par for the course....so i am not totally disappointed....i wish it would just behave and stop powering off...though i am happy it powers back up ok....came new i think???....no scratches at all...very clean in original box....ac charger included....use mine with PAGE PLUS CELLULAR pay as you go using verizon towers...its cdma....great coverage...clear and no drop calls at all....RECOMMEND HIGHLY PAGE PLUS .... ( :,OK
"Hello I am writing to let you know I'm a little unhappy, for his article, that makes them buy days .. because razon.ustedes put my picture of product, a phone whose front picture HTC's symbol. but is selling another .. which has the image of ATT & T which is not like me at all the truth .. because I trusted that what they sold me was the same as advertised on amazon .. so why my 3 stars for you .. and hurts living in Venezuela, because it would make them get their equipment and get my money back or at least a change .. over the phone that I really wanted. HTC was the front and back ..",OK
Nothing was wrong with it at all. Just wasn't what I thought it was at all,OK
"wouldnt buy again, the speaker got bad with just one month. Buy another cell phone, not this one.",OK
Got it sooner than what it said in order. That was GREAT!!!! But downside was it came with no book and everything was in chinese.,OK
wish i could find a sidekick 2008...but this 1 will do for now..o and it such that u have to order special headPhones in order to listen to the radio or MP3 in public setting.,OK
"nice little computer, wont work on venison so i cant tell you how it is as a phone :P",OK
"Camera stopped working after doing a OTA Update. I contacted Blu, and they replied quickly with RMA instructions. Currently device is in their hands waiting for a response regarding the RMA. Will keep updated.",OK
The phone works but regrettably it came preloaded with AT&T apps. We need to be made aware of this when we are purchasing phones. I do not have AT&T in my country so I am not interested in their services.,OK
"It may do everything but came with no information. I had to look on the internet for instructions and even they aren't clear. The back falls off frequently and the phone needs to be locked between uses or you inadvertently press buttons in error. It is comfortable in the hand and the buttons are easy to see. I probably wouldn't make this purchase if I were doing it again,",OK
It is a nice phone but it comes with Chinese software and no working version of google play. One has to horse around a lot to get it going.,OK
"Phone works fine and battery is great but it is difficult to figure out how to do everything. The user guide is not very helpful. I would prefer more detailed menus. Also my husband keeps it in his pocket, so if a button gets bumped it beeps which is kind of annoying.",OK
"This phone is excellent for the price. The screen bright and clear colors, it is amazing regarding I was specting something with cheap feeling but the reviews were right.My only complaint is that when unboxing the phone, I found that it was just the phone and the USB cable, just that. I understand about cutting manufacture costs but any phone should come with their wall charger and headphones (at least cheap headphones). I would probably gave five stars to this product if at least was clearly stated that the box includes only the phone and its USB cable.",OK
"Seems to work okay. Good graphics. Feels solid. Sending it back due to NO WARRANTY. It was not stated in the description on Amazon. If it was, I would not have purchased it.",OK
"Good quality, long battery life, a bit complicated to use, but overall a good phone.",OK
battery consume too fast and difficult to put on silent mode when in a meeting or when required too bad,OK
I bought this phone specifically for travel out of the US. The camera quality sucks but it served its purpose for my trip to France.,OK
I was happy to receive the phone . I am not happy that it is not rooted,OK
"Fast, clear and easy to navigate. Because it is an older model, there are features we wish we had, like auto correct.",OK
"The volume button didn't work 90% of the time. I bought it assuming it was new. It wasn't the screen was not the original. The battery was old and inflated. When I tried to charge the phone I had to hold the charger in for a few seconds to make sure it was charging. Even then it would stop charging on it's own.I had to buy a brand new phone (full priced) to make sure I wasn't getting another ""new"" phone.",OK
"The phone worked great the first 2 years I owed it, but now it doesn't hold a battery charge for more than just a few hours and it's constantly abnormally resetting. Granted 2 years is a long time for phones, I still wish it was built to last at least 3 before having those types of glitches. The speakers are not very good, so sometimes I have problems hearing people if the connection is poor or if there is a lot of ambiance noise. I bought 2 units, one for me and one for my wife, and they both have the exact same problems.",OK
"Purchased 2 phones to bring back with me to Nigeria for use there. One phone had numbers stored in it, soit was not new as advertised. The other phone had a used battery. Advertising fraud???? Will not purchasefrom this vendor again.",OK
Good phone. A little on the large size. The finger print scanner is not as good as other phones.,OK
"From the moment I opened the box I feel in love with this phone. Out was big it had a great camera, a kick stand and it was much better than the iPhone 4 so I was happy. This is a wonderful phone except it has three major flaws. For one as soon as I plugged it in I was having problems with it's charging port, then i did some investigating and found out that it happens a lot. Secondly HTC phones are prone to cracking. Thirdly the battery life is poor it takes a lot of work to make it last the day.",OK
Good used phone that I bought that is unlocked to send overseas to a family member that is in dire need of a good phone. Little nicked up but good enough for the price I paid and screen is in good condition. A+,OK
"would not fit unless I changed my phone cover ,phone not protected as well as before.",OK
"It's ok just because the guy was nice and tried to help but it took a month to deliver the phone, with a lot of excuses (the mail lost it, etc.)",OK
Seal appeared to be broken when I first opened the package. Phone is the best I have ever experienced so far. Be careful with these international phones if you are a US buyer.,OK
It's a good phone only issue is poor Wi-Fi driver don't forget us on windows 10,OK
This is one time I should have invested in a better quality phone and not attempted to save money. This phone will not be with me long and an upgrade is just around the corner.,OK
"The ringer control on the particular unit I purchased is not dependable and the speakers are sub-par,",OK
"Unsatisfied with this phone. Not the sellers fault but I received the phone and instantly started putting my normal apps on it. Not far into this process, I ran out of space. After looking into my storage I realized the system data take up 4g of my 8g of space. I bought an SD card for this but am annoyed because many of the apps I use only work when on the phone, not on the SD. Also, I have to install the app onto the phone, then move it to the SD card. Being someone who like to install multiple apps at a time to test, this is a huge annoyance. Next time I will do more research before purchasing a phone.",OK
"Overall, the Link is a reliable and handy little phone with a high quality screen and many features. It is rather slim, and fits conveniently in any small purse or pocket. However, it does have a couple of drawbacks. The first (which I have come to get used to) is the relatively cramped qwerty keyboard. At just over 2 inches wide, there is little room for a full keyboard, however, the Link combats this using tapered and raised keys making the problem less obvious. Additionally, after just a week, I am typing with ease.The other issue that I have run into is the small amount of memory for messages. I have to empty my inbox about every other day in order to keep my phone from freezing up. Which I really don't have a problem with, other than its slight inconvenience.But overall, this is a great little phone.",OK
"I got this as an inexpensive replacement phone for my Galaxy S4. I don't need all the bells and whistles that new phones offer. I just need a reliable phone that I can occasionally surf the internet on the go from, use Spotify to listen to my music, and connect to my cars bluetooth for calls and music. This does all of that. However, the most important feature of a phone to me is call quality. The call quality is TERRIBLE. It sounds incredibly tinny and I can't understand the caller half the time. This is only due to to the cheap quality speaker, call quality over bluetooth is great.",OK
The phone have a problem with the earphone to listen to people when you call.,OK
"Great Camera. Screen is somewhat fragile. First smartphone I've ever broken the screen on, and within the first month. :(",OK
I've broken two of these clips getting into various cars. That's why I can only rate 3 stars.,OK
Charger did not work with the phone that was sent. Not the original charger. Was very irritated about that. Phone worked good but how am I suppose to charge it.,OK
"The sound when making or receiving a call, is very low, is very hard to understand what people say.",OK
"Ok, when I first turn on the phone and started to work it out, I actually thought I was done with Android. Well I still love the phone's look. However I'm finding more and more that not only it doesn't work as hoped but it's clear that Windows Phone has a long way to go to be appreciated as Android. Honestly most of the apps that I am used to simply do not work as smooth as I found them in Android. To make matter worse the phone is giving ominous signs of freezing up. After just four months? That's unacceptable! So I probably wouldn't buy it again, unless this one is perhaps defective. But I'll say it again, it's a beautiful phone in my opinion!",OK
This device is as comparable to other devices on the market and what one comes to expect from SONY ERICSSON.,OK
The iPhone's home button was not working which makes the whole phone not worth 214$ i would not recommend this to a friend,OK
This item international and I live in the US. Other than that the item is fine,OK
"It is as durable as advertised and has an incredible battery life. Yet, the phone feels cheap and plasticky. It even has poor call quality, which is almost literally its only job. I would not buy it again unless it was sold at a much lower price point.",OK
"I had the galaxy s4 for over two years and loved it. I cracked the screen so I upgraded to the galaxy s5. I am not happy with the s5, it is difficult to charge, it's very sensitive and will not work with just any charger. Will not work with my portable battery chargers.",OK
"Phone is NOT new as advertised! No SIM card, NO quick start booklet...Believe the phone is refurbished! However, works fine (only been using for a few days yet) and screen is crystal clear.",OK
"Buenas noches, por favor necesito ponerme en contacto con el vendedor, para que por favor me envie por emial la factura de este celular,no lo he nacionalizado por ese problema",OK
"The phone itself is in great condition; however, the battery was terrible. It wouldn't hold a charge long and would drop about 30% after a five minute phone call. I hopped onto Apple's website and found out the battery was part of a recall (you have to enter your serial number to see if your battery is part of the recall) - Apple fixed it free of charge. It might be worth it to check the serial numbers before selling the phones so the product fully works.",OK
"great phone, good price, fast shipping, only problem was the extra charge by FedEx that I did not expect.",OK
Sadly have to return. Finally determined the bottom speaker does not work. Lengthy process to discover. No ring when in my pocket.Otherwise it's a pretty decent small phone (what I was after to begin with).I may try another.....?,OK
it does what it should... the numbers are large and its not confusing.... nothing unnecessary.... however its unclear how to get back to the home screen without shutting the phone off and back on,OK
"Quite finicky with GSM retailers - 4G/LTE phases in and out with this guy. Overall, the phone works fine. The dual SIM card slots is a big plus. Speakers are definitely lacking in volume.",OK
I thought this phone was gonna be more than it is. It's OK. It's a phone.,OK
"good phone but, the camera makes a noise like a laptop would when on and adds a sound that's like coming from air conditioner nearby.when i rotate the phone the camera is on, the lenses make a screeching noise, almost like an old door.overall not too bad, not too good. well not what i expected it would be.",OK
I love the size and Everything about this phone except the volume. Impossible and poor quality speakers.,OK
"Bought it for my Mother, she said the keyboard is too small for her, but the phone itself is fine. I'm looking to replace it with a larger key pad for her.",OK
"Bought 2, one came looking poor than expected, the other 1 was fine. One charging cable was bad, cudnt charge my iPhone.",OK
"the phone itself works ok im not unhappy with the vendor I received it from, but the phone itself isn't all that great. The battery dies often and takes a while to charge. It takes a while to load things sometimes. All in all its an ok phone to get me through until my upgrade but I would never purchase it to use for a long period of time.",OK
Was a little disappointed when I tried to take a photo. The SD card was missing. No manual or any contact information was included from the actual seller.,OK
"It's ok product, I have some difficult to write message in T9 predictive mode, due to firmware is in English, and I live in Mexico. For use internet, it's slowly, and have it very poor sign captation. Over all, it's a good issue. It's ok.",OK
"Nokia C2-01.5 is just an average camera. The back was hard to open and it came with no sim card. However, I was able to use the sim card from my AT&T phone. I got a good deal from AT&T and am happily using my new phone. Still lots of things to learn about the phone.",OK
"I bought this phone for $130, and while it was worth the money, it does have problems.The first and most important is that at times while making phone calls, my recipient will no longer be able to hear me. However, I can still hear them. This is not a huge deal for me, because I don't make many phone calls, but I'm sure it would be to most people.The second is the construction is pretty cheap (of course it is, it only cost $130!) The power button has broken a couple times on me. It seems like the button is just popping out of position or something. Both these times I hit the phone against my hand a few times, and it started to work again. On a good note, I have dropped this phone an uncountable number of times already and nothing has cracked.The third is the camera. It's pretty awful. It is only 3.2 MP after all.These are really the only complaints I have of this phone. I would definitely not buy it if you are used to iPhones and other high-end phones though.",OK
"I enjoyed the phone in the beginning. I hated that it had bloatware, and it keeps trying to push these ASUS apps onto me. Eventually my phone had issues. It turns out this model had a recall. You could call them and they would give you a replacement for like $25 I think.",OK
"just got that phone and it seems to work with basic stuff. It doesn't work with the AT&T microcell, which is real important to me. according to att it is not fully compatible, and that's why it is not working with the microcell. Unfortunately I have to return it",OK
"functional...arrived quite dirty/crusty...sorta gross, but cleaned up fine and works fine for basic calling (which is all we were looking for). Havn't tried any other features",OK
"it says that it is Unlocked in the ad, but is it? I opened up the package, turned on the device and it strangely it had a magenta letter T on the screen. Hang about, it is a T- Mobile germany phone. with t Mobile apps and customisations. and No nokia blue theme. Only t mobile grau (grey). It made me laugh considering that i have a strong anti carrier phone policy. that was false advertisig on the sellers part.",OK
I HAVEN'T TURNED PHONE ON YET: IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALSO STILL WAITING FOR MY OUTTER BOX CASE ......,OK
"Headphone jack stopped working after two weeks. I've read this happening to a few other customers. Otherwise the phone is excellent, but this issue is very annoying.",OK
"I needed a new phone becuase I broke my other one. So I selected a new Iphone. I got this phone in the mail and everything on it works fine and runs like it should. As for the charger I got, It was a used charger and didnt work at charging my iphone. I contacted customer service and they told me to contact Apple. I contacted apple then went back to the seller to try and get my AC charger replaced or have them send me a new one. Niether has happened. Very disappointed in the customer who is selling this product. Bottom line is phone is great seller is terrible.",OK
"Not much to say, I got the product, it arrived on time and it works. But its not as I expected it, so I am disappointed.",OK
"Cool phone, great picture quality. My only major Con is the speaker--they are horrible. I have to use the earphones when talking on the phone in order to hear",OK
The only thing I dont like Is the volume is low and ive turned my volume on my phone all the way up in still barely can hear,OK
"i couldn't believe in that. it doesn't matter if you're connected to the net through WiFi or not, unless you don't have a special blackberry data plan for this unlocked device you can't even setup an email account. i could get this phone for FREE with plan i HAD to purchase just to use as simple thing as email. why nobody mentioned this important future in their reviews???by the way, for those who experience problems with blackberry battery life, just remove those facebook tweeters and other social network guys, and you battery will be back to life.",OK
"The phone is pretty good, but have 2 things that I don't like about it. My phone was made in China, so it came with Chinese manual, I don't understand Chinese, it should have a part in English. Another thing is it's charger was made for Nokia in China; therefore, it doesn't fit the U.S. power outlet.P/S THE BOX HAD NO SEAL!",OK
Not the ZTE Axon I thought I was going to get. Resolution was only 1080 and ram was only 2 gigs. An ok phone for an ok price.,OK
"The item arrived a couple of days ahead of delivery date which was great because it was a late Christmas gift for my granddaughter who was in need of a new phone. However, the charger that came with the phone does NOT work!!!!",OK
"I asked for a lavanda blackberry, and I receveid a purple one.I receveid on tome, but in different color.",OK
"Not the fault of the seller, but this phone does not seem to have the quality of my old RAZR, which I used for several years before losing it. For one thing, it keeps dropping the bluetooth connection in my car, which is very annoying when you are making a call, especially in my state where making calls with a handheld phone while driving is illegal. The old RAZR rarely did this. I have to hang up, usually power down the phone and power up again in order to reconnect.Besides that, the battery runs down really quickly with no warning. One minute it looks fully charged according to the display, and the next minute it goes totally dead.",OK
"Very nice phone except for a MAJOR problem with DUAL SIM operation. The reason for a Dual Sim phone is for the purpose of staying ""connect"" in a fast paced world. This phone does not allow you to have Mobile Data available when both Sims are active, it simply shuts off when both sims are selected. Between T-Mobile and Samsung, the problem could not be resolved. The answer was ""just have ONE SIM active and Mobile Data will work"". Wrong reason for me when I have 3 Asus phones working perfectly fine with Dual sim operation on T-Mobile. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED.",OK
"What can I say, it is nokia again, with this hardware, it doesn't work well because of stupid windows. Bluetooth doesn't work. Forget multitasking. You can not receive calls from skype and tango if they are not running in session. Camera is fine but not good as iphone or samsung. What you give is what you get, if you want a simple phone, you can buy..",OK
Ordered BLACK NEW LG EnV2 cell phone recieved a Maroon Lg EnV 2 makes me think that I actually recieve a Used or remanafacture phone,OK
"I did forget about ""butt"" dialing. And for some reason, my Bluetooth hands free voice command does not work well. Can't decide whose fault that is. Love the keyboard.",OK
the phone is great if you need a easy to do phone i just wish it was a little smaller to fit in my pants pocket better but its a good phone,OK
"The equipment was in mint condition as new, I choose to return the product due to te product was not able to use my country signal band for the LTE connection.",OK
keys are kind've small and tends to constantly turn to voice command mode due to button sticking out. Makes great calls and keypad and buttons are tough. good battery life.,OK
"Seal was broken. Some tiny scratches on the back which was a little bit loose. This cellphone might not be a brand new one, but it's still almost new. who knows•_ÙAll the other conditions are pretty good. LG G3 has the same size of screen as Iphone6 plus, but it's smaller and lighter.",OK
"phone is fine, takes good pictures but battery life is bad. doesn't last a day of normal activity and it's brand new...",OK
This unit is the second unit that I got off line. The unit I got was supposed to be very good but this is the third I have gotten and this on like the others does not work correctly. This unit when slid open reset and it takes 2 to 3 minutes to reset. I do not believe there is a working Blackberry 9800 torch. A working Torch is great but The first one worked great for 1 year and the speaker blew out. The next one just did not work but it was reconditioned and returned. The next one was a very good unit that again did not work. This one locks the screen or resets the whole phone and very seldom rings. I just bought a new one but I am not holding my breath.,OK
"Pretty good for a used phone. Not as durable as I hoped for, but it had pretty good reception, nothing outstanding",OK
"For the life if me, cannot get this thing to receive texts. Calls are fine. Texts are sent fine. But nothing u do fixed the issue.",OK
"The phone arrived fast and the phone is beautiful. Although the instruction manuals are all in chinese and the phone was previously set up for a village or something similar in Taipei, Taiwan. The camera isn't the best either with the user expecting a 13mp camera and having come out subpar. I am concerned about the phone being fake. It seems as though it was used and then put in english.",OK
i would have given it five stars if they would have included a wall charger,OK
"I have read amazing things about this phone. Most of them are true. As always, I would prefer Android better, and having a nexus makes you experience Android at its best. Unfortunately, when I opened the phone and took the first picture I found out the camara is damaged.Before ordering, I read another buyer had a negative experience with this seller. I just wished my experience was going to be better. I recommend the phone, but I have my doubts about the vendor. If you are interested on this phone, you may want to look for another seller.",OK
"It worked ok for a used phone, volume down button loose on phone when got phone",OK
"the phone works very well. what I was disappointed by was when I went to register it with blackberry, I was told that the 2 year warranty had already expired. it would have been nice to know that there was no warranty when Ibought it.",OK
"This phone has a factory history of camera problems, plus ate up battery time too fast.I knew the history before purchasing. No fault of seller. I just needed this phone to get by for a while.",OK
"Ordered this phone about 1.5 years ago, I guess I'll review it. The phone was in excellent condition out of the box, but it was NOT unlocked and had to pay to get it unlocked. The OS is very dated so it was a bit laggy. I guess now you're able to update the OS so maybe that will help. :)",OK
"My daughter has literally dozens of cell covers so wanted to stay with the 4S. They usually last just about a year so not very well made. My son's has a OnePlus One and it is much better quality, esp the glass (and the backing is nicer too). And I have a 3 year old Samsung (basic phone, not a smartphone) that is still in decent, useable condition. This has iMessage but other than that, I don't think they are worth it - we're on our 3rd one already",OK
"The phone is good and meets my basic needs. However, the scroll down manual is unclear in many areas. Sending and receiving text messages are unclear. Have called others who have similar phones for guidance.",OK
If you're buying this for use in the US you will need to buy an international charger adapter. The charger that it comes with will not work in the US without an adapter. Other vendors on Amazon provide it.,OK
I had a hard time with the camera freezing at first. The camera would freeze after i took one picture. It was really annoying to want to take a picture and then have to take the battery out of my phone because it would freeze. I also don't like the charger it comes with. It is always telling me that the charger is not compatible and will beep at me all night. I started using my husbands charger. I had to factory reset the phone after a couple weeks because I couldn't get the low memory icon to go away even after erasing everything manually. So it takes a while to figure things out but I am starting to get the hang of it and like it now.,OK
"phone work excellent, ive owned this phone previosly. It work great with straigth talk. i reccoment this phone to people who plan to use it with straight talk.",OK
"Do not buy this phone if you text much, want a long battery life or want to view your phone in bright daylight. At least 20% of the time messages will fail to send. Battery life is about a day. There are loads of applications that cannot be removed and take up much of the memory. It also needs to be rebooted periodically by taking the battery out as it locks up every week or so. It is a phone that was designed and put together quickly.",OK
"the battery doesn't hold a charge very well but we're satisfied with the phone. Our original phone went through the wash and didn't come out very well so we needed to buy an inexpensive phone and this fits the bill. Shipping was fast. I would buy it again if I needed to. I just think I'll quit doing laundry, it's getting too expensive washing phones :)",OK
"this phone is Excelent, But waterproof!, when I probe with water, superficially, fogging and take you to check and was told that he had entered the water, separate wing inside the device, but did not suffer major damage.",OK
Works OK. Just wish it had a ground tab to help secure it to the wall better. Some of those those wall-warts can get quite heavy.,OK
I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas..I like it so much that I am thinking of getting the same one in pink..The phone works with t-mobile sim cards and is very easy to use..I like the touch screen and apps...It is a great phone..,OK
"It had a lot more scratches on the back than I thought it was going to have, but all in all it worked for a good 6months... you get what you paid for.",OK
"The mobile is Ok but in the description said that it is able to work with 4G, that is wrong. I'll kindly suggest to delete this point form the page description",OK
Bad volume takes 9 hrs to fully charge speaker phone low big phone but slow and for straight talk carriers u have to buy $60 SIM kit to switch over,OK
"Everything about this phone is very good, except one thing. The rear facing camera is disappointing, pictures are far from being good. The front facing camera is very good.Other than that I really like it.",OK
"I was satisfied with the product the only thing was a blue line going down my screen I just wanted to make sure my screen,wasn't going to go out or nothing but other then that I love the phone.",OK
"IT'S OKAY, I wish I had purchased the rugged 3 instead. I do thank you for this one because it's better than what I had.",OK
Hello i received the phone I love it but number 2 sim slot say forbidden it don't work nut I can get it check out here,OK
Great for protecting from every day use. I put my phone in my back pocket so the edges have taken on some color from my jeans. The bottom one seems to be wearing after a week of use already. The plastic part is fine. The rubber is taking on color and is easy to rub off.,OK
"Awesome deal, and I might almost buy it again in retrospect. Occasionally freezes up, which is annoying. Mostly hate the apps the phone comes with, that are sometimes very hard or impossible to delete.",OK
"I still am not sure what I think about this phone. It isn't all that easy to use, but it is an older phone. I will update either way as I learn more.",OK
good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible,OK
Thank u I receive it but it's say it include a handset but is not in there,OK
Received phone with defective battery. It did not charge and had to order replacement battery,OK
The phone was in good shape like promised but you would think that if someone just paid 254.00 for a USED phone that it would at least come with a phone charger. Plus the phone didn't have the capibility of being activated from the phone. So not only do I have to go up to the verizon store to PAY to have it activated but I also have to spend more money for a charger.,OK
Works just like the original otter box clip just not as thick of material have had it going on 4 months so far so good,OK
"Average phone; decent features all around and nice thin form factor.The battery is non-removable. That knocks an entire star off.Android Lollipop is... deficient. That knocks the second star off. Lollipop has numerous issues. Hotspot doesn't always work with all clients and mDNS is flaky, weird media player/background behavior, etc. All known issues, all classified as ""won't-fix"". This is endemic of all Lollipop devices.Otherwise the performance and specs of the phone are actually pretty decent.",OK
Phone looks fine but i need a sim card just to access the phone. That was a waste of time,OK
"I bought this phone as a very simple replacement for my wife who only wanted a phone to make and receive calls--that's it! And this phone is great for that.But ... it is only has 850 and 1900 band frequencies--not 1800 which is what my wife needs in India. We thought we were all prepared with her ""International version"" Motofone F3 and an Indian SIM card purchased before she left; we tested the Indian SIM card with the Motofone and it worked great. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that did not mean it would work in India. It worked here (in the US) because it roamed to a 850/1900 MHz network. But in India, the SIM card needs a 1800 MHz network. My wife now has to get another phone to use with her Indian SIM card.",OK
The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it.,OK
"You cannot activate this phone on a Verizon contract. Also the phone is a bit small, for old people I know they want something bigger.",OK
its ok i mean like its not like they said it is glitchy and the camera sucks,OK
"Phone was 5 star battery was at best a 2..would never charge all the way up, had to replace it right away.",OK
"Maybe it is better if used with AT&T, but just minimal when used with Consumer Cellular.WIFI works now and then, even when right next to my router, and my Wi-FiCan' t send photos via mms, although C C has tried to set my network to do so.So, here I have a phone that I paid more for, because of the 5 MP camera, and Wi-Fi, and both are either iffy or non existent. So, save yourself some money if you are using it with a network other than AT&T, and get the less expensive model.I thought it would be ok because Consumer Cellular uses the same network as AT&T.",OK
"I bought this unit from jcstore. It is a T-Mobile Germany version of the device, unlocked though. I didn't get any recipt or proof of purchaseOverall, the Lumia 800 is an awesome device. The display is beautiful, all features work properly.The only problem is the in-call volume. I tried it several times, in several locations and there is lack of clarity and audio volume.I can only hear the other person clearly if I align the earpiece directly in my ear. The volume is at maximum but still it is too low. Moreover, in noisy environments it becomes completely inaudible.I am surprised no one else mentioned it before. It could be a problem with just my device but I doubt it.I am probably going to return it.",OK
There was a case that came with the phone but the mouth holes don't match up....also absolutely nobody carries cases for the particular model. This is my second BLU phone I love the company but not this model. If it wasn't to late I'd exchange it for the Studio in a heartbeat !! The worse thing is nobody can understand me...everyone says it sounds like I'm hiding under a blanket so I HAVE to use a Bluetooth.... Smh. But again I love the studio and should have gotten that instead.,OK
it is not the best but for its price it is very good but because it is refurbished it is missing the center button,OK
"I am switching from an iphone to an android, so this phone has been fairly easy to get used to. The battery dies extremely quickly, even without any applications open. A dying battery is one of the reasons that I needed a new phone in the first place.",OK
The phone is great but the camera does not work and I too it to Nokia here in Greece where I live and they order a part and I am waiting to see will I have to pay for ths part or is it under garentee?,OK
"I don't receive my memory card.I guess they took it out. the phone was good for 1year,but after that I see some call drops,shut off by itself.Overall , it is not bad for the price.",OK
"I have not use it yet, but it looks nice and cute .But how do I get replacement batter?",OK
Great phone I was really happy with it except I couldn't get more then 2g on metro or T-Mobile I want to return it but I don't know how,OK
Listed as no contract and ready to use but phone was retired by Verizon and could not activate.. Nothing wrong with the phone besides not being able to use it.,OK
"This (Orange) case is HUNTING CAMO on the back, which is not noted in the description anyplace. The case itself is fine and would protect the phone as well as any other OB Defender case, but the design description is very misleading... if you want CAMO, get it; if not, find another color.Update: We purchased two of these cases, one in Blue and one in Purple. The purple one already has cracks in it, which is something I didn't expect at all from an Otterbox. I expected much better durability from this case in the 5 months since we've had them.",OK
The phone is fine and does everything as expected. The charger is not the original and it is really bad!!,OK
"I agree with ""Andy"", the C1-01 is a good basic phone. I bought this phone in 2011 for $49.99, it is $10 more now (2012). The battery seems to last a very long time. The phone has a minimal camera, but do not expect to take detailed photos - the result is very ""grainy"". In sum, a reliable, compact, and dependable phone with a relatively long battery life.",OK
These were purchased as gifts so I cannot really comment as to functionality of the phones but I got feedback from one person who said that they had a problem with one of the phones.,OK
"After 1.5 years the phone is on its way out. It was a good phone for about a year but now it only partially charges, resets itself randomly, GPS no longer works, and appears to run much slower than when new.",OK
"Works well. The parents and I all purchased this phone. I had to purchase another phone due to the charging port breaking internally. It was probably my own fault but I ended up purchasing another phone that had a little more strength to it. functionally it worked great. Only slowed down when running Pandora, fb, craigslist in background and games.",OK
"The phone is perfect, everything to expect of a SonyEricsson... the problem was being able to use it!! It comes out of the box in Chinese, so you better speak Chinese, or know someone who does. I had to go through many online videos of people setting up their phones and try to follow their steps to be able switch mine to English, wasn't easy!",OK
"This was my introductory phone to Touch Screen cell-phone.Pros.* Always liked small phone I can fit in my pants' pocket easy. This one does.* Graphics are clean.* GPS and WiFi capability* Can be used as WiFi router, but with a downside (see Cons under connectivity)* Screen is quite strong for a little guy. I never used a screen protector and I have no scratches after a year and a half.* IT takes decent photos (5MP)* Sound recorder is awesome. I recorded a conversation (kind of spying) and had it in my pocket. Voices were clear.Con's.* Connectivity: it is only EDGE band. Using it as a WiFi router for my tablet was not fast enough, making it USELESS to have this capability.* The RAM is only 600MB.* Can not handle a memory card larger than 8GB (I only tried a 4GB one, but I assume it could take an 8GB one) I did try a 14GB one without success.This is a good phone for a kid (10-15) whose parents are wise to realize that to spend $500 on cell phone is ludicrous.",OK
It is for people who don't use APPs. You can use it only for email and normal phone functions. you can forget about the SMART and samsung brand makes it expensive and runs out of internal memory too quickly.,OK
"I have been using the phone for a while. It works really great. At first I had some conflict with the lock/unlock problem but the seller promptly took care of it.I've been using this phone for a month now and everything is fine except one. The screen does not rotate while I am browsing the internet. It used to earlier when I first got the phone but now it doesn't. I don't know if it is a software glitch or a hardware issue but other than that, I really love the phone. I love it's design, especially how thin it is. Speed is nice too. Compared to what is out in the market now, this phone is nothing but if compared to the phones that came out during its release period, I will most certainly say this one's a winner.",OK
"Everything looks cosmetically fine. but there was one issue with this order. The micro Sd card reader was damaged and there are no ways to fix it, as far as I know of atm.",OK
Great phone.....then the camera stopped storing images for some unknown reason. Still plenty of internal an external memory. Outside of that....decent phone.,OK
"It came in Italian language, already had to reboot it and it wasn't locked as per my carrier told me.",OK
"I have had some problems with this phone but, in general, it is in good conditions. I recommend every body to contact the seller first before buying to ensure the full functionality of your future device. The devices, they are selling, are used but they have to be able to do all their operations. With the money I expended to repair my device, I could have bought a new one.",OK
When using headphones in this phone the right ear doesn't work! phones is nice otherwise tho. what can be done to fix this?,OK
"This phone needs to be rugged. First of all the instruction book is a joke and trying to figure out how to configure the phone is enough to make you throw it at the wall. Then when you finally do figure it out, the icons on the top left side of the phone are so small that I couldn't tell what they were, even with a magnifying glass!",OK
I love everything about the case except for the screen cover. You have to push really hard on the screen cover to enter information. I did read some other reviews and they felt the same way. I would have given it 5 stars if the screen cover fit better because I feel that my phone is well protected with this case. Also love the color!,OK
My phone only lasted a year and there's no way i use any kind of warranty because i live in venezuela. it was good while it last,OK
It's a shame that Sony did not pay enough attention to this product. It lacked memory and processor power.,OK
"Bought this phone and returned it right away as it is not a tmobile branded phone and could not do wifi calling or get HD voice calls. Ended up buying the same phone from tmobile for a couple dollars more and got the unlock code from tmobile so that I could use the phone in europe with a prepaid sim card. Love the LG G4, just not this unlocked/unbrand phone for daily use on tmobile.",OK
"Great compact device. Is not your typical big display, but is really easy to carry around.Friendly interface; however, I did had issues with accessing and reading the drive at first.(That's why I gave it a 3 star, but it should deserve a 4 or even 5).I plugged the usb to y PC and it was reading it as a ""drive"", and couldn't add music another things, so I installed the Samsung Kies program(sort of Itunes for Iphone), and thatdid the trick. Now...I don't use the program for uploading stuff, I only create folders andname them(Music,Pictures,etc), that way I just drag and drop, it's easier and faster that way,even better than something like Itunes. You can also create playlist and all that stuff.",OK
"Great phone with 2 issues, GPS does not lock in to location, battery life is not good.",OK
"The Motorola Droid 2 is an okay phone. The only complaint I have with it is that I charged itas soon as I got it and gave it to my daughter and the battery didnt hold its charge at all, andstill doesnt. I paid over a hundred and some dollars for the darn thing, the battery should at leasthold its charge!",OK
"I bought this because I needed a phone to replace a broken one in the middle of a verizon contract. It is reliable and does not shut down for no reason, like my Motorola Droid. However the battery discharges very fast and it does not have as much memory and is slower. I know it is an older phone, and it was a good choice for what I needed.",OK
-Update: 2/23/16-The thumb sized unresponsive circle on the screen has resolved itself but there is no telling if the issue will pop up again so I am putting the rating at 3 stars for now. The device works well other than this issue with the screen/S Pen.,OK
I really liked the case. Fits my phone like a glove. The price was great for an Otterbox. Looks great on my phone. But the problem I'm having is I've had it on my phone less than 2wks & the hot pink gets stained from my jeans or anything it comes in contact with. I'm not a dirty person so I'm not doing anything special for the pretty hot pink to start darkening. I think it'll only be a matter of time before I have to replace this b/c it looks like crap from the discoloration. If it wasn't for that I'd give it 5 stars. But I see myself replacing it soon. I'm constantly wiping it off but it doesn't all come off. Ugh :(,OK
The phone runs good the only complaint I have with it is that when I got my first one the speaker blew up within the first 2 weeks and then on the second device I received the speaker is starting to distort at about 80 percent volume,OK
i find it kinda annoying.. the speaker button and the off button collide all the time.. and when i'm turning the screen off i sometimes inadvertantly turn off the volume so i dont hear people calling.. i also dont like the fact that i cant post pix to my facebook automatically i have to go to facebook and then upload pix.. that sucks.. plus i dont like not being able to send voice/recorder texts.. all in all disappointed.. next time i'll stick to samsung..,OK
The battery is too weak and can only last less than one day for normal use.,OK
Used primarily for phone and text service works as expected. Internet use is not viable. Tried to access google and used 10 minutes before I was able to much. Great price and is what was expected. Replaced lost phone that had same features. Would buy again if I wanted this type of phone.,OK
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,OK
"I read all of the reviews and even checked online to make sure this was a good phone.It is not a SMART PHONE it is the most STUPID phone I've ever owned, and I intend to return it ASAP.It took 3 days of searching online to find out how to download ringtones to the phone that the phone will actually let me use. Nothing in the manual or the online manual tells you the hoops you have to jump thru. If there hadn't been a BLOG I'd have never figured it out.This phone shuts off immeditately if I turn it on and accidentally turn my hand sideways while holding it.It won't get AT&T service at my house, even though my AT&T GO Phone gets a signal without a problem. It won't hook to the 3G network half the time. I bought this phone NEW so it wasn't remanufactured. Do NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.",OK
"I love the phone but I'm having problems with it and my carrier and samsung can't fix it.There is a pop up error message,if anyone has any ideas please let me know.",OK
"This is indeed a nice phone but it isn't entirely unlocked. I bought this phone to use with Straight Talk and while it will make calls with my Straight Talk Sim card in the phone it will not access data without having a WiFi source. The software in this particular phone will not allow you to change the APN settings in the phone. I'm sure there is some way around this but I couldn't find any instructions on how to do it without rooting the phone which is said to void the warranty and I didn't feel that I should have to go through all of that anyway so the phone is being returned for a refund.Bottom line, if you are an AT&T customer this is a great phone and a good deal. If you are a Straight Talk customer save yourself some time and look for something else.-I would also like to note that i contacted the seller and they were nothing but helpful, I give their customer support an A+",OK
"Phone was fine. I got it a month ago.But today and yesterday, the battery caused quite a lot of problems.I have to conclude that the battery is defected. Not to mention that the battery has no brand on it whatsoever.Yesterday, when my phone has 80% battery capacity left, I turned off the screen and put in my pocket. 1 hour later, my phone died so I had to be without a phone for half a day.Today, even worse. Battery capacity went from 64% to 14% in just 15 mins.Note that I did not even have wifi on during this whole time. Furthermore, it is not possible for a phone to consume that much power in this short period of time even with all features turned on.Very unsatisfied with the battery. Apart from that, product and shipping is good.",OK
I bought this galaxy s4 about 3 months ago .I was getting ready for my vacation to Manila after a week of use the camera stop working andI tried to get it fix and went to Samsung dealer here in Manila and the verdict was ... too expensive to fix LCD just quit .... Im sure its a good camera and smart phone but I didnt have a chance to use it and no help from the dealer.Ron,OK
"Was not told it was the smaller version LG G3 in description when ordering and was not told it was international version. Phone works fine but was not ""given the whole picture"" of what I was ordering.",OK
"I bought this phone because my little brother lost my dads new one. He was using a really old phone for at least 6 months. So for fathers day we got him this one. The item was listed as ""Very Good"", but the phone has a large dent/chunk missing right on top and whatever coating was on the buttons was peeling off. Phone works really good though. Only problem was that we dont use data and I bought this phone figuring it woulden't need any since its an older version texting phone. Verizon is making it so that its older models require the minimum data plans which was really frustration to find out. So thats $10 a month wasted :/",OK
The only problem I have is that the phone is in another language. I changed it to English but I couldn't change the app store to English fully.,OK
"It works but I don't get great reception, the sound quality is only ok and the buttons are hard to push",OK
"I had high hopes for this phone based on reviews, but unfortunately the one I got would not connect to my Consumer Cellular/AT&T network. It read the SIM card and contacts and connected on WIFI, but no calling or texts. On the plus side, shipping was right on time, and even though it said 2-4 days after receipt of item for a refund, they posted my refund within an hour of when I dropped it off at the UPS Store! Good customer service!",OK
"I use this phone for the apps and for wi-fi. I cannot use it as a phone because everyone I tried said they were not capatible the whole reason I picked a phone without a SIM card was so I could choose who I wanted as my carrier but after spending an entire day driving around I found out it wasn't capatible with Straight Talk, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Boost, or T- Mobile. So if you need a phone to use as a phone don't pick this one but if you are looking for something you can use for the apps and to get on line using wifi then the phone works great.",OK
"Not sure yet... as a staunch android user, I want to give it a chance.",OK
"the phone its okay i thought it had more features than that, there is no camera and upon receiving the phones the chargers was not working i had to purchase extra chargers. i am from trinidad and its costly to have these items sent back that is why i depend on you to supply me with the best product and service",OK
"PROS:-cheap-4GB ram, snappy fast performance-big full HD screen-dual simCONS:-cheap fragile plastic-screen brightness is dimmer-screen is yellowish",OK
It's a good phone except the H key takes several clicks before it puts the H in the txt messages on screen.,OK
"I enjoyed this phone a lot, fast, great camera and convenient, but I just hate the battery life so much. I charged it the whole night, and I used it like only three hours. Then, no battery.",OK
All pretty much okay. The one thing not okay is the front display. The screen will not take any type ofpicture due to it being damaged.Other then that I am happy with the product.,OK
It was a new iphone Although I was having some issues with it because it would not alow me to download any social media apps,OK
I loved this phone and was using for 10 months until it became unresponsive. It was fast and easily handled multitasking. All of a sudden the screen would go blank and it wouldn't respond for hours.,OK
The description of the phone said it was new but the box was open and the charger was used.. The phone it self looked new and it word greate!! Can complain over all..,OK
"I liked the phone. It's my 1st samsung phone and i have a great opinion of the apps and everything, the only thing i would change is the battery. I have to charge it 3 times every day. No really what i was looking forward to.Also the box said it included: handset, rechargeable battery, charger, USB cable, quick start guide.I could say that i didn't get my handset.",OK
"As much as I like this phone there are a couple of issues I need to address. The first thing i notice when i got the phone is that it was not factory sealed and it had been opened before. Not only that, but after looking into the settings the system been MODIFIED. Because of this I don't get any new update. What's worse is that the phone crashes and then KEEPS REBOOTING over and over. None of the recovery options work except for a factory reset. Even though it works after that, the system is still modified. This happened to me two times already. I would watch out for this.",OK
Everything was well product came on time only one issue battery that came with one of the phones doesn't charge so now i have to spend money on another battery,OK
Overall the product was as described. Unfortunately the lens protector on the camera was so scratched up that it needed to be replaced.,OK
I have discovered they do not make Apple products like they used to...the top button locked up on the third day of having it.,OK
I love the Otterbox Defender Series cases for my Samsung Galaxy S5. My 2 1/2 year old has dropped my phone on all terrifying surfaces with no issues or breakage! I honestly wouldn't pick the pink cover again. In under a month it shows dirt.,OK
"They are ok but the break so much, need a bunch to keep my phone on my belt.",OK
"El producto a mitad de enviÌ_ fue devuelto, por no ser de bandas 1,2,5,6, la devoluciÌ_n se realizo a peticiÌ_n mÌ_a, no especifican las bandas del producto lo hicieron cuando ya habÌ_an enviado por eso la devoluciÌ_n, en cuanto a la empresa fueron responsables en cuanto al reintegro de mi dinero.",OK
If you speak Spanish it probably would be a great phone. I don't so I returned it. Love AMAZON,OK
Be aware that this item does not include a power supply. The included micro USB will only provide 0.60 amps of power throughput when trying to charge an iPhone and an iPad at the same time with this setup. The iPhone and iPad will constantly chime as they start and stop charging. I returned mine.,OK
"I was looking for an unlocked dual SIM card phone I could use when I go on vacation, that had a nice camera. My everyday phone is an iPhone 6, and although I prefer android to apple I can't live with the quality of most of the photos android phones tend to produce. However this phone is different-it takes great photos! It fits comfortably in my hand, and although I'm concerned with only having 8 gbs of storage on the device-I know an ad card will be a great place for photos, videos and music. The screen is super bright, however the device does feel cheep in the hand. What can you expect for the price though. If you would rather have a better build quality then epic camera quality you need to go with the kata i3s-it's built better then many flagship smartphones, and although it's advertised as 3G speed it gets the same h+ this phone gets.The camera on this phone-although not iPhone good, is still pretty epic. It's honestly better then the galaxy s4, and comparable to the Galaxy s5 camera.",OK
I can give more because of the charger i dont like it a all. kind of charger doesn't look ok to me it has 2 pieces to plug in and doesn't fit into the plug the phone is ok no complaint,OK
"this iphone was worth the money i paid, it was cheap therefore i was expecting some sort of minimum malfunction, happens that the home button was a bit warned out but still workedno complains",OK
I LOVE the size and you can barely feel it in your pocket but the connectivity is really bad. I lose signals pretty often and it can be annoying. Was almost a perfect phone.,OK
"Not bad for first timers good phone for any body gsm ok like itWould recomand it to any body.,",OK
"Great phone - 5 stars!It is not unlocked!Yes, you will be able to insert a SIM card for other carrier and use it.No, you WILL NOT receive any system updates for AT&T branded phones!There is a lot of work on system going on now, and receiving updates is very important.Best buy an unlocked phone from Blackberry site.",OK
"I received the phone in a tattered case, it looked used and torn up. When I pulled the phone out it looked new and had most of the parts. I had to buy a sim card before I could take pictures because the phone did not come with one. There is also not enough storage on the phone, I downloaded a few apps and shortly got a message that the memory was full even with the additional sim card that I purchased. Otherwise, all the features on the phone worked fine.",OK
Awkward interfaces. Purchased for my father and its a little too complicated to use for him. Ie not intuitive. Screen completely scratched 2 days in. Ie not a durable screen.,OK
"Its working well but i do not seem to get why it sometimes switch off by itself, i do try like three attempt before switching it on . Apart from that, its good.",OK
"Anyone looking to save money on a phone, this was a great device for the 15 minutes I tried to use it. But it doesn't work on AT&T's data network (didn't notice this was a 955 and not a 950 - my fault!!!) and it comes with a European charger. This wasn't in the description despite the phone being stocked in an AMZN warehouse located within same-day distance of me here in VA.",OK
This phone works ok add it's for my Teen-Age daughter however it does freeze up a lot and she had to restart the phone but it is a good value for herThank you,OK
"It Looks nice, but the box looks generic at best. The power brick is generic, black and not Samsung branded.",OK
"I took this phone into 4 different countries across South East Asia and the internet and media all worked as expected. the phone on the other hand did not. I tried 5 different sim cards from various countries and NONE of them worked properly or worked at all. So gave up on the phone and used it as a messenger and media player. I really enjoyed the media player portion because I have many files in WMA format. It's a gd mp3/wma player. It's compact and sits well on a armband. As for the phone, I bought a cheapo and that worked! I had to carry both but it wasn't too bad.As far as for the rating of this phone I really would only 2.5 stars. One star for the phone and 3.5 stars for the medai portion. I would NOT buy this phone again but I the Win jr HD sounds a bit more promising. I may buy again before the next trip but very unlikely.",OK
Just had this for the weekend. Friday work great but Saturday and Sunday nightmare it keep freezing up and even shuts off by it self. I'm trying to see maybe I have defect one try to replace this one but I only see is refund my only options.maybe there's software issue or something. My conclusion i can't recommend this to anyone size is great looks good too but is to damm slow specially multitasking between apps especially on fb or messager.,OK
"Good, except the fact that I can't share internet with this phone outside the US.It would have been good to know before I bought it.",OK
"Pretty good phone, but the Moto G now has a problem with disconnecting from you provider ever since the new KitKat 4.4 came out. I haven't heard of a definite fix and my phone is constantly losing connection to the ATT towers. Other than that it is great, but this issue, is of course, not acceptable and extremely annoying. Hey! my phone doesn't connect to the network. Yay!! Exactly what I always wanted. Or is it Google's fault? Supposedly this started after the Android update.",OK
Its a good product only that the network provider (ULTRAMOBILE) does not provide internet facility for this product which seemed very unfortunate and sad to me for i am addicted to face book and other internet services. Above all its sound system is awesome!,OK
usb cable was damaged and did not come the memory card if the phone is in perfect condition thanks you very much,OK
"Came as advertised and in time, not much to say about this known product.My first review was positive but I am modifying my review. I needed an Unlocked Cell phone to be able to use it abroad.a few days ago it fell and got the screen messed up.I took it to repair and waited in the workshop while it was being fixed.Much to my surprise the person fixing it told me and showed me that the phone had been open and the parts being replaced where not original, it had a screw missing and parts of the screen circuits where not glued like the originals are.It never affected the performance of the phone but I suppose it shouldn't have been sold as new when it was probably refurbished.",OK
"The product was as advertized. It was a gift I bought for someone. So far, the person did not report any problems about the phone. I think it is a good buy.",OK
I've had this phone for about a month and for some reason the video player in my browser stop working. And it breaks any ear phones that aren't Samsung but for the most part it's and OK phone,OK
"Not sure what to make of this phone. I really liked it when I got it, but it's starting to act up. Shutting down,jumping top different apps. ,typing things then it disappears...if it doesn't straighten out, I'll update review and ask for a replacement. Also, I know it's an Amazon phone but really?!...way to overloaded with crap.",OK
"The phone sometimes switch off and it's always hot, still watching of its continued may have to return it but in all its nice phone.",OK
"Hello, BUY this phone because it said it came UNLOCKED, CURRENTLY live in Venezuela and the phone came in 3 languages ‰ÛÜ‰ÛÜ(English Canadian, French and Chinese) and to insert sims card I lifted the Signal. What I can DO? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me.",OK
"In terms of hardware its excellent, 5 stars. But in terms of business use, software it sucks. My phone is an extension of my office.. emails, calendar and contacts. In all those it sucks. I have it synced with my office exchange server - esp the calendar doesnt work",OK
Great phone! Love the size and battery life. However the phone constantly freezes up. I just returned one for the same reason thinking it was that particular phone. However once I got this one I realized it is the 4 series. I will be going with Apple for my next phone now that they come in larger sizes.,OK
"If they put a quad-core in that phone, it would be a good deal; but, as is, it's too slow. Rather than seconds to connect to a website, we're talking minutes and it was not uncommon to have the connection time-out before it was secured. Other than that, itwas just too big and cumbersome to truly be mobile. Using it at home would be fine, but for me, carrying it around was too inconvenient.",OK
"Purchased this phone for my mom, it was her first smart phone. I have the note 3 so i know the phone well, however what i didn't do was check out all the functions and features before the return date. One day she was gone listen to music on the blue tooth i bought her, and all the phone does is growl. The microphone doesn't work and never did when we purchased the phone, but it's my fault for not thoroughly checking it outwhen i purchased it. But buyers CHECK OUT YOUR MERCHANDISE.",OK
"I ordered what was supposed to be a new Blackberry Bold 9000. The first one they sent was clearly used and not working well. The second one may or may not be new but it was made for Vodaphone in Denmark. It works sort of ok on T-Mobile (I told seller it would be connected to T Mobile) but the software is some non-authorized version that BB does not support and cannot upgrade. The result is some funky outages and an inability to fully synch email, calendar and contacts. So it works as a phone with some aps, but not as fully as it would if had been made for T mobile or ATT. Buyer beware of these cell phone suppliers.",OK
Charging port has been badly damaged. The plug is very weak and sometimes the phone does not recognize it's being plugged in. Fear it may stop charging all together.,OK
"well I did not bring my laptop charger that had additional , expected me to come with the phone but did not come, because the Z30 brings its additional accessory that brings its cargo stack , but nothing came as expected the laptop charger.",OK
"RAM is low and phone is very slow, not a lot of space to store apps.",OK
"I give the actual phone 5 stars,but the picture is NOT the actual item as said,it had alot more damage than it showed in the picture and the screen isn't perfect either,it works,but not happy with the seller for lying about the picture which was near mint being the actual phone k would receive,and it didn't come with a charger like the ad said,I had to use an old one I had laying around,like I said I like the phone in general,but the one I receive it totally worn out,not happy with the purchase,and I never leave bad reviews unless I'm really unhappy,this is a first,just disappointed",OK
"at first it work really well, but after a few days it started to cut off during calls, txting and down loading...so far in the last 5 days it has not cut off",OK
"I did not rate that high because the quality wasn't as good. I bought 2 iphones as an anniversary present for myself and my fiance. His phone- home button doesn't work sometimes and the camera phone has a crack in it so the pictures come out fuzzy. My phone- It worked GREAT at first, but one day I barely dropped it and it broke internally. No one has ever seen an iPhone break like that. I ended up having to buy a new phone. If you don't mind spending money and taking a risk with your money then it's a great buy, or if you're not expecting a good quality phone.",OK
I returned the two phones because my wife and I decided they were not smart enough. This is not a complaint as the phones were exactly as advertised.,OK
"I bought the phone because I was led to belive that it could handle WiFi calling. Not true, unless you have a carrier contract to that effect. I returned the phone, and Amazon gave me a full refund.",OK
"It was an okay item for the money , i don't own it anymore , I believe I bought this item for my Brother a while back .",OK
"Im giving it 3 stars. It works fine for just your average phone. The negatives are short bluetooth range, short wifi range, and the absolute worst is the fact that they promised android 4.4 kit kat May 1st, then they promised June 1st, now saying end of June. How many times will BLU PRODUCTS put this update off??? I also bought the BLU LIFE ONE X and its the same situation. If you are wondering, go to facebook and search BLU PRODUCTS and youll see everyone else is complaining too. This is not on the seller, the phone arrived on time as advertised. I have no problem with them, its BLU themselves that keep upsetting me and a whole lot of other people. They are more into selling their newer models and forget about the people that already bought from them.",OK
"Used this phone for two days, and then KAPUTS, it just freezes up on me and will reboot everytime I try to enter my pin. Dont waste your money. Its cheap but won't work at all. Just save it for better phone. Very small phone. I bought two phones and the other duo android sold on amazon sucks too, so I switched to this - they're both sucky. Keep your money!",OK
"Fits a little big on the tablet. Have to shake it sometimes to find the button to turn it in, but...keeps it covered!",OK
The color does not look as good as the pictures. Is it possible for me to trade for the Green one?,OK
"I bought this phone for my wife as an upgrade, and the phone looked immaculate, but it only worked for a couple of months because the volume stopped working. Luckily I called Verizon and due to the fact that the no longer had any replacement iPhone 4S phone I was sent an iPhone 5 instead so in the end it was all worth it.",OK
Great phone but the charging port died after 5 months. Since it is a Blu phone it is hard to find replacement parts.,OK
"It works good except at random times and doesn't come back on for hours and the screen is lit up but it makes a sound over and over again. Which is obviously really inconvenient, kinda wish I wouldn't have wasted my money.",OK
"Received the phone in April and thought it was the the best affordable 6"" phone on the market. I was comparing the style, the vivid screen, and picture quality to an IPhone. Little did I know that the phone would began to crap out on me. I've had the phone for five months now and it suddenly started randomly powering off by itself and taking a least a minute or two to repower. The phone went from that issue to now suddenly the camera won't work. I've tried all the troubleshooting I know of and even contacted the blu brand. They inform me that it's technically nothing they can fix, just return the phone back to the manufacture and they will try to fix it. Meanwhile I would be left with no phone in process not even a loaner phone. FYI.. Probably will never buy blu brand again even though their phones are beautiful, stylish, and vivid color screens. The internal quality is not up to par. Buyer beware!",OK
"unfortunately Sprint could not activate the phone due to the blocking issue with the phone, the matter was handled very well and quickly. Very satisfied with the service.",OK
It's a good phone for anyone who's a little tough on their phones. The only thing that I would change is the location of the buttons non the side. They're to easy to push while you talking or texting and change the screen. Other than that I'm happy with the phone.,OK
its an okay phone the phone arrived in brand new condition but i just wanted something with bigger buttons for texting so i gave it to one of my sons friends and they love it,OK
"The phone is fine, just can't do any e-mailing because it is a T-Mobile phone and I use ATT. The color didn't mater I just covered it with a hard case the camera and every thing else works just fine, I just can't sent photos back to my computer.",OK
This phone is no good if has pure problems....No battery lifeNot good screen its just keep moving up and down and changing when ever...just bad the worst phone I ever bought.,OK
"It freezes and lags a lot on non-blackberry apps. Specifically, spotify. Music streaming is essential for me, and thus a blackberry, no matter which model, is out of the question. I tried to give the classic a chance but it's just not the phone for me. However it still works pretty well and I love the keyboard so i'll give it a 3/5.",OK
"I cannot used, because I'm from Venezuela, and here cannot use CDMA. But is a good phone if you are in USA",OK
"They sent me the worng phone... I received a Curve.So far it seems to work fine, but the parts of the charger are wrong, they just don't fit to one another.Also there is supposed to be a memory card and it did not come with the phone either. Kind of dissapointing actually.I believe I will manage, but it is just not right and wanted you all out there to be ware.",OK
This phone had the least internal memory of all the cell phones I have used the color purple suits me being fabu!,OK
Since this one was made in China it is not as good as the original Nokia. It is similar but not as usual friendly. I don 't know where the originalOne that a&t was made. But it was considerably better. It took 1 month to receive it. If I had know this I would not have purchased it.,OK
"Desafortunadamente para mi el cargador del celular me saliÌ_ malo y tuve que comprar otro, ademÌÁs, cuando intento tomar fotos y muevo la mano, la pantalla se congela y me impide tomar la foto.",OK
I love it but it keeps dropping my calls and turning off by itself. I reported it they replaced it with a new one it still has the same problem the only reason I keep it is because I love the pink one I've had all of the order colors,OK
"I loved the phone but it started malfunctioning in late January early February. It keeps freezing up on me and the battery dies way too fast. Thing is, I'm in the caribbean now and can't return or replace it.",OK
"The phone is great, but all I received was the phone and the charger. No headphones, or charm, not even the doc...",OK
"Actually I can not say anything about the Atrix HD, new seller ships a different telephone. It is a new seller and seller is bad, dishonest.But if I have an Atrix 2, which is very good, the screen is good, the camera also, and quality of construction is very good. And therefore, I assume the Atrix HD also it is.",OK
i needed something to carry through until our new phone could be obtained . the phone is fair.The keyboard is not so great.,OK
"This is a pretty good price for the device itself, has a decent screen, great battery life and is very lightweight. However it is really only good as a phone because of its tiny internal storage capacity. You can only install apps on the internal storage no matter how big of an external SDcard you add to it. That is only good for music, files or photos. I would not buy again mainly because it comes with so much spyware and bloatware pre-installed that you cannot remove. Every few days it will automatically install more spyware applications/games that can potentially send your private information out over the web, and you have to jump through hoops to root the device in order to remove that stuff... not for the novice android user.",OK
It's hard to type over the plastic cover. It's kind of big and bulky. It's hard to get to the charger area and all the other options on the phone.,OK
Serves a purpose. Can't wait to go back to my smartphone that doesn't randomly shut off on me.,OK
It said it was brand new but had a couple of scratches on the corner of it. I would have requested another one but i was on the corner si i guess thats not that big of deal right? Sendig it back would be a hassle.,OK
"The phone is good, but I'm having problems with the battery. It shuts down, then does not turn on... the battery now appear swollen! I don't know what to do.",OK
"I gave up my Iphone for something simpler (I have a number of lines so I still have smart phones). Small and light. It comes with a european two prong plug which then is paired to an adapter. Also you can't change the image on the home screen, so I hope you like flowers. I can't complain for what I paid.",OK
"rugged phone but not loud enough for me,maybe the phone was defective?.otherwise great product,battery life great and overall quality excellent",OK
"The seal was broken when I received it. Although Samsung indicates clearly that do not accept if the seal is broken, I accepted it to save me a potential huge amount of trouble by bearing a huge amount of risk. It is reasonable to assume all the unlocked Note 3 this seller sells are open box. I do believe seller should indicate this situation. However, I bought this for my wife. She thought she can live with that so I leave it alone. I didn't even bother to find out where the phone came from. It could be from Europe, it could be from Asia. Any way, for others who are interested in buying from this seller, be aware of the risk you are taking.",OK
"Needed the same cell phone since mine no longer charged and this way could charge new battery and put in old phone to download the backup assistant to get my contacts. I guess it is new as stated, but it must have been sitting a long time cause the battery needs to be charged daily, and I don't use it a lot. When my original phone was new I only charged it once every 2-3 days, this one doesn't make it through the day. The phone itself is almost identical to my original phone, works on verizon with no problem. A few differences as far as display and settings, but nothing drastic.",OK
"The phone is a great has an alarm clock, calendar, calculator, ad camera. My only problem is that I am an ATT user and it will not accept MMS messages ( picture mail or fwds) it asks you to retrieve message, but will not open it. So if you don't mind not being able to receive MMS messages it's a great phone.",OK
"Smartphone that I received has contained a breakaway part on a top, near power button.Works fine but I wold prefer do not have surprise like this.I tried to check if it possible to change skin for this, but skin is a part of screen and too expensive.",OK
"my only complaint is that the battery does not last that long enough even in battery saver mode, my Z3 performs better at this",OK
I'm having real problems with this phone..took it to repair and cannot get parts for it,OK
"So, the phone is fast, has a good sized screen. 4G Worked for T mobile and 2G worked, but 3G did not work. Whenever I am in a 3G only area, the phone is useless. The Phone has ATT Start up Screen, ATT specific programs pre-installed and badging so just be aware.",OK
It contains softwhere from a Germany Company ....impossible to erase... and nobody talked at the description about. That was a bit disappointing. However... the cellphone is amazing as I expected,OK
"I bought this to replace my broken phone until I was eligible to get my upgrade from Verizon, it served its purpose.",OK
Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,OK
The phone seems to work okay but the number of Apps is limited. Several of the Apps I need to use are not available.,OK
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS NOT 100% COMPATIBLE WITH T-MOBILE LTE. SINCE ONLY 2 GSM CARRIERS EXIST THE PHONE SHOULD BE FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH BOTH. THAT IS A MAJOR MINUS.,OK
Phone is good. But I don't like headphone that headphone not fix my ears. If it possible please change bullet type headphone in ears. Please help me. And your deliver is very late I'm wait for almost 15days. But when I order that time showing 5 days it's not good as much possible deliver faster. And more my data cable too short.,OK
In buid memory is very low can't support large data unless you install micro SD card,OK
nice value for the price.. I bougth this for my 5 years niece and know she will love it. f,OK
I did not realize it would take so much time to get service for this. Had to finally call Great Call to get service and then it takes 24 hours to activate.,OK
"I ordered the Blackberry Bold 9000 without camera, it came with a camera. I received the wrong charger and cord and had to purchase another. There is no 1-800 number to relay this information",OK
The phone is up and running beautiful. Good buy and seems to work and looks great. The issue that created the rating of three stars is no owners manual. This is my third phone purchased from Amazon. To sell a phone and not furnish a owners manual or even a copy of one rated the three stars.,OK
"I've had the phone for about two weeks and so far it hasn't given me problems it's been running pretty smooth. I really like it so far, but it has really bad front camera quality the back one is decent but not the front. Also it would make it much better to have more accessories available for this phone because there is rarely any and the screen protector is a bit costly.UPDATE: After having it for a couple months I've noticed that the phone gets really hot whenever you use any app and it has started running much slower even though i still have a lot of memory free on it. It has started freezing up and I've had to shut it down a couple times in order for it to unfreeze.",OK
Nokia Lumia phones are far better. However the quality of Nokia phones are expected to decline now that Microsoft is in control.,OK
Didn't get the battery life I was promised. Plus the phone overheat at times. Everything else is going great.,OK
Its not bad for the price. Still trying to figure out how to make the facebook app work and to change the language to English. Other than that its okay watch.,OK
"the charge does not last more than 12 hours, I have to charge it every day. Is there anything I can do to make the charge last longer",OK
"I'm a blackberry fan and since I cracked my screen of my passport, I went ahead and replaced it with priv. The phone is nice. It was suppose to be delivered by fedex at certain, it did not. No fault of the seller. FedEx service in my residential area is unsatisfactory. However, when I opened the boxed I noticed that it was in AT&T packaging, booted up with an AT&T mobile log and has a AT&T logo on the back of the phone. And upon further review it has AT&T apps loaded that you cannot delete. So this is truly not a factory unlocked phone from blackberry but an unlocked AT&T blackberry priv. The description should say that. I use TMO as my carrier and now I have unnecessary applications taking up memory space on my phone. I'm planning on sending it back because I wanted a TRUE unlocked blackberry phone. Please update your description to indicate that this is a AT&T unlocked carrier phone. Even though my TMO sim works fine, I have to deal with the AT&T loaded apps, software and settings.",OK
Don't buy from Sell Phones.. The Phone says that is a D855 but it is a d850,OK
"I liked this phone so much but was frustrated to have two main problems.one of them is distinguishing connected Arabic text, where after doing some research and using some demo phones that uses windows 8, this problem does not exist so I hope they will fix this issue in all the windows 7 phones with the 7.8 update.The other problem is the echo the other side keep hearing when I send or receive phone calls, hope this problem will be fixed soon.",OK
The mic of the earphone is not work. Just got it two days and the price is cheaper now. I like iPhone 4. Beautiful. Bit my SIM card is big one. How can I make it smaller,OK
"I don't use this phone... it's for my grandfather who is terrible with electronics. Ok, it works, gets good reception, etc. The biggest problem with it is that rocker button on the front outside. It controls the volume ONLY when the phone is open. What a dumb design. For some reason, he ends up hitting the button and eventually turning it to vibrate/silent and never notices until one of the other relatives complains they can't reach him. Make sure your technically-challenged user knows how to use a rocker-style button... that took a little explaining.",OK
"Phone's display is very good. Other than that it's quite flimsy. Be aware that International version will NOT support ATT's 4G speeds (bands are not in software), plus it will not support Visual Voicemail as this is not their base version of OS. Sometimes freezes up. Battery charges slow. Camera on the phone is not so great it requires a LOT of light to make a good picture. I was about to live with it because of the big screen, but phone suddenly quit on me and will not even turn on! There're obvious issues with reliability, not sure if I am returning back to this model. Returning mine back!",OK
"This is a great phone for international purposes (that is, if you plan on using it in countries where blackberries still prevail), however because the Tour is not a popular as other models, it does not always work. Sometimes the ""EDGE"" (proof that internet is flowing) will shut down, not because of your network service provider, but because of the phone itself.The phone wasn't really meant to work outside of the country it was made, so you'll find it sometimes becomes incompatible with the service. If this doesn't matter, then it's a great deal.",OK
"The basics of purchasing something is getting what you ask for. I ordered a BLACK phone but instead got a WHITE phone. The product itself is good, but for a company to make a mistake like this is just plain scary. Main reason for purchasing is for the dual sims and i am loving that so far. Device quickly was updated to 5.0. It runs well but gets hot at some weird times. I dont mean warm, i mean you cant miss the fact that it is hot. I have had two instances when i look at it and it is off. These have been registered as ""System incidents"". Was reading up on these incidents and i am a bit concerned. These situations are different from from restarts that i have triggered be squeezing the door outside the dual sim area. I assume that when i squeeze there, i move the sim underneath and this triggers a restart. I can live with that because my sims were cut. Screen is lovely, its loud enough so i dont miss calls, camera is good, it switches between apps effortlessly and well, its a good phone.....so far.",OK
"We needed a basic phone with no data that would be good for texting and phone. Unfortunately the texting feature on this phone is not that great. It is hard to type a word like ok - it always changes it to something else; as well as a whole list of other words. The ability to change the word back by pressing one key (past phones you just pushed the 0 key and it would switch to another word, press again and another word) - not so with this phone. It can be very challenging to just type a 10 word text!!",OK
I love the phone but mine came with the battery and backcover missing. Amazon was was great and offered my a refund so I can purchase a battery and backcover. Phone now works great with Cricket!,OK
"Does the job is compact and able to hear it when it rings, my problem is with the carrier not the phone",OK
"initially I had problems getting both sim cards to work and it was not the sim cards as i tested them on other mobiles. since I work in the middle east I was update that I purchased online and then could not send it back. then I discovered that the cost here was similar which really irritated me. After switching sim card slots and testing it eventually started working, which was a relief !",OK
"Shipped quickly, good phone. deleted all m info when I had to restart it, but happy otherwise.",OK
Basically battery is getting drain out very fast not as expected.initially it was ok but after two months started this problem.,OK
I dont like the buttons. They are too small for big fingers and everytine I try to answer I press other buttons and end up hanging up on people.,OK
"I'm not sorry I bought this phone but I will be going with something else from the Sky Devices Line. The phone itself has a battery life that sucks BEYOND description, you can't find a case that is made for this phone & you can't ""swipe"" words while texting. The seller was just great and got back to me immediately with a question I had in regards to my shipment & I will be buying from them again. Overall, for the money this phone was a great buy & very well built.",OK
Some of my features don't work and my phone be freezing on me and it takes a few min for the call to go threw not happy at all with the phone can I get another one and do I have a warranty on the phone,OK
It is a nice phone.The bad thing is that the third time i've dropped it the glass broke.,OK
"Phone is sluggish, performs poorly with stock version of jellybean. But, the application I used to flash cm11 was infected with malware...",OK
Will fit 2 ID cards in the pocket. I tried 3 but it caused a jam and wouldn't open. The front of the phone does not seem very protected or drop proof. This case also does not fit the 5c very well.,OK
"Fast arrival and good quality for price! Got the phone to replace an expensive phone that broke. Typing on the keyboard on the screen is tedious. Using the internet is very slow, too. Seems study enough and came with extra covers which was nice. Overall, I am happy. This is a great holdover phone until I can afford a new Android.",OK
The phone was in good condition and worked perfectly fine BUT!! the battery life is horrible my phone dies in 2 hrs,OK
got for my dad and he loves it the simplicity of the phone makes it what it is. it came brand new in the box with all the accessories,OK
The phone is having issues the date is wrong the time is wrong its not working right we were wondering if we can return it,OK
It is ok. I was hoping for better performance. I cannot have all the apps I want because it stops working.,OK
okay all alone in my country used 3g and 2g phone is T-MOBILE funcioa me super slow with the data,OK
"Everything was great, except for the fact that iMessage and FaceTime wouldn't work. If this weren't the case, I would have rated 5 stars.",OK
i hate this phone.. had nun but problems.. cud nt activate.. was told esn didnt exsist and was rooted.. and the phone was in horrible shape.. tap and scratches everywhere,OK
"I've been using this phone for a few months now. It's been very good, easy to use and fast. I noticed once in a while, the person I was talking to on the phone, would have trouble hearing me saying the volume of my voice was too low. Then other times the volume of my voice was fine.A couple of days ago, the microphone in the phone went dead and the only thing the person on the other end could hear was static.HTC support told me to soft boot, then hard boot the phone, but it didn't help. I now have to contact them again to say their support help did not work.The company seems very sincere in wanting to help me and the phone is still under the 1 year warranty, so I am sure they will take care of me and my phone.I might advise you to buy insurance on this model phone as I have seen and heard of a lot of HTC owners having microphone problems with their HTC EVO 4G.Will update later.",OK
"The cellphone is good, but when I check it I noticed that the battery is not samsung s3 but samsung s3 mini. And contained no instruction manual.",OK
It's a good for the price tag. I really liked the battery life and all other aspect. The screen design makes it difficult to recommend this phone. Thin phone + 5.5 display is prone to CRACK!!! My idol3 screen cracked in regular usage and I'm no longer able to use the phone.,OK
"It's not clear from the product information that this phone is a packaged AT&T handset, and will only receive OTA updates when an AT&T sim is inserted. Also, there is no known root on this model, whereas on other continents' variants there is.",OK
it messed up in like 2 days the power button brook in 2 months and the ear jack wont work I think it is a wasted of money,OK
"This Samsung galaxy note 4 is OK, but i don't like the feature, i think the 3 note feature is kinda better than it, I'll try to get the 6 maybe the 6 note feature might be better than that. i don't really like the 4 note",OK
It's a good phone but I would prefer that it comes in a factory way. This XPERIA Z3 is an European version with some apps of its local provider (german) an its charger doesn't work without an adapter,OK
OK Phone not very user friendly. But ok if you ned a spare phone. Would be nice for a young college girl or a young female executive,OK
I just bought it because I had the same phone and lost it. When my contract is up I will upgrade.,OK
"Phone was for my brother. It gets the job done as far as I can tell, he's quiet, doesnt say anything unless something is wrong so since I've not heard otherwise; no news is good news. :-)",OK
"At first this phone was great, the only problem i had with it was that the home button was loose and would often get stuck down causing siri to come on, but other than that it worked well. until one night i pulled it out of my purse and it said no service, i thought it would just turn back on again but it wouldn't let me call or txt. i brought it into verizon and they told me they couldn't do anything for my phone and i would need to but a new phone for the full price. after that i was very angry because i got this phone to replace a broken one and not even 2 weeks later it stops working. But after talking to amazon and and the company that i bought the phone though they had me send back the phone and they gave me a refund. Im upset about the phone but i am thankful for good costumer care!",OK
This phone has no slide out keyboard. The wrong pic is being displayed with this phone. Other than than its not a bad phone has a lot of features for such a compact phone.,OK
"I have had numerous issues with this iPhone 5, but after hours on the phone on several separate occasions with Apple technicians, I believe most of the issues have finally been resolved. The primary problem was that the software needed to be updated. Based on my experience, I hope in the future if I ever need to replace my phone that I will be in a financial position to purchase a new rather than a refurbished one. At this point I had no choice. The cost was a 50% less than a new phone, so I was happy to be able to replace my iPhone 4 (which finally went dead) at a reasonable cost.",OK
This phone is great for its size and design but not much else...I chose this phone for its size because it was not as oversized as the Galaxy S6. From a design perspective and size the phone is great especially if you like a smaller phone. The drawbacks are that the processor and battery life are not as good as the galaxy 6. There is noticeable delay when switching between apps and my experience with battery life is only 8 hours on a single charge. Only choose this phone if your top criteria is a smaller form factor. If you want battery life and speed then choose the galaxy S6,OK
"Text message auto recognition program does not work very good, type in 3-4 characters and it still does not recognize the word, over 50% of the time you have to type out the entire word...what a bore.",OK
"Amazon said they shipped this item and it was in stock. After 15 days Amazon said that it was not in stock and printed a shipping label in error. So what I thought would arrive before Christmas did not because of Amazon's lack of honoring a product they said was in stock. Lesson learned is if Amazon says product is in stock, you probably should not count on their word.",OK
"The email won't load. After numerous attempts and also with the help of an AT&T rep, we realized that this phone is not working as well as it should. I can't check my email, but I can get a call and make a call. It's a little pricey, but I'm keeping it as a back-up in case the cheaper phone I have dies.",OK
bought this item for jamaica but it only works with one of the phone carrier out there and it not the carrier i boughtit for ..,OK
"Im a little disappointed with this phone, it looks great, it feels great but right out of the box the WI-FI antenna does not work. So this phone is overseas right now, I cant return it or exchange so I guess I have to pay to have look at it.",OK
Great phone but the capacity of the memory is too low. With a few apps downloaded it is full.,OK
Smaller than I thought it would be. Works just fine for my Husband as he just wanted a simple phone to replace his broken LG,OK
"Bought the first one for my son about a year ago. Works fine, especially for the price which was about $57 and free shipping. Bought another for my daughter last month, but this one had a defective touch screen that would not power on. Amazon's no-hassle return policy is truly terrific and between them and/or the vendor, a UPS driver was soon at my door with a completed return label, all postage paid. Soon after, the purchase amount was fully refunded to my credit card. As long as such great customer-first policies are in place, I'd have no qualms about trying this phone yet again. After all, the first one is a real trooper, now in its second year of service for my son.",OK
"Everything about the phone was nice expect the speaker and mic quality. in call people will not be able to hear you, sometimes, which turns out to be most. I think its a software issue that consistent with most of the phones as this is my second one with the same problem...You either have to talk on speaker or with an ear piece. You just want to keep it because it looks so good but that issue you just cant bypass.[...]",OK
"The phone was affordable and it does work, but there are differences that i noticed.Some of the software is different than the original Cingular release, but it still works fine.There were these photos on it that were of these random people . . . before selling a phone, factory reset the devices first.",OK
"Wife loved the phone, except that the software kept over-heating. Causing the phone to shut off for lengthy periods of time.",OK
Positives:RuggedLooks niceGood sound qualityDrawbacks:Can't get it to send/receive pic messagesCan't make the text larger (it's a pretty tiny display)Still trying to figure it out,OK
"1. an unlocked phone bought straight from the manufacturer should come with root access, this doesn't.2. low volume during calls even with volume set to max unless you put it into speakerphone mode each call3. the standard exit app/home/memory usage toolbar should be pushed further down since the touch screen is bigger than the graphics screen, with it being higher than standard it covers up the edge of some full screen apps and games4. doesn't have encryption, which is a security issue since on android phones you're permanently logged in to your Google accountother than these issues as of oct 2014 it seems to be a ok middle ground phone until better ones become cheaper",OK
"Really neat phone, has no WiFi which is exactly why I bought it. Love most things about it but the signal strength compared to my flip phones is horrible. No signal between tall buildings.",OK
"Slow phone, but good for price as an extra/spare unit which is why I got it.",OK
I like it but the battery dies pretty. Quickly... But if not for that I would give not five stars,OK
"Battery life is not very good. Had to return it. The phone is pretty light, easy to carry around.",OK
I love this phone every thing is great except being a phone. Calls drop or dont connect. People say you go in and out they cant hear you and it gets so hot. I guess I really cant call it a great phone can I . I need to return it. This sucks because now because if yer another LG phone I lose money time and goodwill.,OK
"the item i received was in good shape, but a fake earpod were provided inside the box. keep that in mind",OK
"I wanted a phone in which I could text easily and this phone does accomplish that. This phone probably has more features than I would ever use but I wanted the Qwerty keyboard.Reason for 3 stars - it does freeze up and I have to remove the battery to rectify the situation. While it is a manageable issue I still think it is unacceptable for a phone. I will use this phone until it dies and then I will simply buy another model.Edit: In April 2015, I FINALLY upgraded to an iPhone so this phone lasted 4 years. After some time, I no longer had an issue with the phone freezing.",OK
"Why did you like or dislike this product?to a greater extent I liked this phone. first of all its a 4G ,has nice windows, camera etcI was disappointed when I found out it had no memory card,why did u guys remove it? it also accommodates only small lines yet in Africa we still use big lines but well they can be reduced to fit personal useotherwise its generally a cool phoneThank you",OK
The phone is good but the back dude is lije a rumble against the floor but the phone work perfect an the unloked is real,OK
Widh the Phone's IOS Could be upgraded. That would have really helped and made the phone modern. The Phone itself doesn't have much built in memory either almost certainly requiring an additional (Purchased Seperately) memory cary,OK
"Well the phone vibrates everytime i type on it, and you can't change it in the settings, very slow with apps and internet use, good music quality, fits perfectly in your pocket, even with skinny jeans...",OK
"The quality of voice receiving and talking is good. The screen size is good but the keypad is much too small and the numbers, letters against black are almost not visible. For this price, you would think to have a keyboard like a computer for sms.",OK
"The optical scroll key on this phone looked like it was loose and felt poorly finished. The earlier peal that i had had the button in same depth as other keys. However, in this phone, the button seemed protruding out. Also, the navigation feels a little hampered because of this.",OK
"It's fast and provides a good phone signal, but since the phone (and all documentation) was in Chinese, along with the Huawei version of an app store. I had to manually load Google Play Store to make the phone usable. (You can find it on the Huawei store by searching in English for ""Play"".)Unfortunately, my Google account on the phone disappears every week or so, forcing me to reinstall the Play Store and reinitialize the phone. I can't uninstall the Chinese version of programs on the phone or turn off Huawei updates, so I am continuously getting notifications to update programs in Chinese.I have it now and use it, but I would not buy it again until it's available in the U.S. market.",OK
"Good phone it serves it's purpose , it seems to have a mind of it's own, I will set it how I want it but it reverts back to regular settings if with Eco mode off.. Besides that like I said for the price it's a very good phone if you are not too picky .",OK
"For my wife actually, because it's hard to see her use a small screen with her multitasking through out the day (she won't use her glasses u didn't hear it from me_Ù÷ä)...oh some glitches (metro pcs)depending on the carrier u use. with the minor issues I gave it a 3 stars.thanks",OK
Love the cover but makes it hard to have in the section of my purse!,OK
I dropped my phone on the pavement getting out of the car and when I went to turn it on nothing came up so I searched around for the part that I need and that is the lcd so I'm highly upset and in a rant because I can't find the part anywhere,OK
"Nice phone, but volume is really low and the screen came with a crack to the lower left side :l",OK
"The phone has some issues that can only be fixed by rebooting it. also so it sounds like people are under water, you have to end the call and restart it. The touch screen is off a bit. But in all for a used cell that came with no charger it works",OK
Granted it was a teen but this phone did not hold up long at all. Phone was used 3 weeks and the buttons stuck. Phone started doing random things. Seller did there part with shipping and so on just not the quality phone I thought it was going to be,OK
It works somewhat like the original Verizon cell phone I purchased but it has a major flaw in its software. I'm in the process of returning it to the third party vender for a full refund as I type. Buying any electronic item like this is a gamble.,OK
I love this phone the only thing i dislike about it is when im on the phone with a call the screen turns black and it wont come back on. With my old phone i could just push the power button and it would come on this one doesnt do this. So i cant call any business because im not able to push numbers for the automated services.,OK
"Phone is great, but can't find a case for it! I would give 5 stars if I could get a case that fit!",OK
"This was my first windows phone. I bought it a month ago, when it was $97. I wanted to get the Nokia Lumia, but my bugdget was tight. I got this one instead because the price was good for a 16 GB phone.Pros: Good internal memory, the software is smoothCons: Too heavy; Looks like it is made of iron or something; cannot set a personalized ringtone for my phone calls and all those; cannot receive MMS nor send them; I cannot send group message, but I can if I use another phone, so it is not about plan, but about the phone itself.Conclusion: I feel like I leave in the last century or so: I cannot send pics by sms to my friends, I cannot set the song I like and set it as my ringtone, I cannot download email attachments even if they are just pictures......If the phone falls on my toe it can break it. It is still better than nothing.",OK
"nice vintage more durable than my previous phones, they scratched relatively quicker than this one and the price was good i had trouble with asigning voicemail",OK
"At first I was excited to get this new smartphone. Inspite of the newness I am disappointed. It seems there is ""limited-at-best product help available. It seems as though this phone was someone's after-thought and ditched it right away. Truth be told I would skip on this phone the next time and choose something a bit more in use. It's a good enough phone I suppose. It has it's flaws which for the most part can be overlooked considering the price. It looks pretty but when BLU gets it's act together maybe they'll make a better product.",OK
"Phone is a great deal for the price. Unfortunately, it does not work with Tmobile. I took it to the store to activate and when they put in the Sim card, the phone does not pick up their network. Also ordered the same phone in black and that didn't work either. Had to return both and got the BLU Dash D171a, which works fine w/ the Tmobile Sim cards.",OK
"I had high expectations or this phone as a previous z1c and z3c owner. The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size. The vanilla-like Android experience Sony installs is appreciated as well-- its the closest you can get out of the box without buying a Nexus imho.",OK
I just received this phone today. Have been trying to set it up. I was told it was a fake! Please tell me that's not true !,OK
The power button is sticky and it is slow. the touch screen takes multiple hits to get one app open.,OK
"The phone has worked fine for my elderly mother. Customer Service is terrible. I had a lot of trouble getting access to my online account, which took several unsatisfactory and unproductive phone calls to Great Call. When I later called to have them stop the automatic charges to a credit card that was about to expire, they assured me that it was taken care of. The next month, not only did I pay the bill, but it was charged to the credit card--a double payment. When I called they had no record of my request to remove the auto payment. They assured me that they were removing it today. I asked for confirmation in writing, by email or a note in my account online, and was told that was not possible. I asked to talk to a supervisor, who said she would send me an email. I will see if one comes. Every time I call I have to wait about 10 minutes on hold before I talk to anyone. They definitely need to improve customer service, especially for a product that is marketed to seniors.",OK
"I have only had this phone for less than two months and it is already malfunctining on me. The messaging is wigging out!!! It has not been dropped, covered in a case, and not dropped in any water. There is no reason for the phone to freak out this way. I am unsatified with this and unpleased with the fact that the seller did not leave any contact information so that product may be exchanged. I am highly disappointed. 350.00 for a phone that is already screwing up!!!",OK
"Was a good phone, I had to order a new battery so I couldn't use it for longer than I would've liked but I enjoyed the phone while I had it..",OK
"Mine was one of the many (search ""Nexus 5x camera problems"") with major camera problems. After working for a few weeks -- long enough to outlast Amazon's return policy -- starting the camera would either cause a device restart or the app would show only a black screen. Poor design, poor QA - a black mark for Google and LG. Also, performance is often very laggy, and as many have reported, battery life is weak. If the camera works and when performance is not laggy, it is a good phone.",OK
