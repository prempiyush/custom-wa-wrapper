this phone is a pain in the butt. don't download to many apps or you'll have to reset it back to factory settings and loose your phone number and have to get it reactivated all over again. also you'll have to deal with it going slow. sometimes the phone freezes and turns off by itself. drop it once and the camera stops working drop it again and magically the camera works again. -_- also it may slide by itself and press buttons by itself. the battery also dies quickly and you can't use any other battery other than the one meant for this phone. same thing with the charger. if you use a different battery the battery will bulge and soon explode. if you use a different charger your phone will be charging literally all day and never get fully charged. :( this phone is only good if you don't want alot of apps. but the phone is still not worth it.,Very_Bad

"I have owned many Samsung phones and never had a problem with reception. But this ""New"" phone has the worst reception ever. I can barely get a signal, Calls are dropped, always says ""searching"". When I have a bar and try to text , it won't go thru in many area's. I had my son stand next to me with his Samsung TM 506 phone and it has full reception, yet the T459 has none?? After researching the T459 phone, I found many other people had poor reception with it. Therefore it seems to be a problem with this model. Don't waste your money on this phone. I ended up returning this phone.",Very_Bad

"I received the phone as scheduled. Initially I was unhappy that the phonr was not sent with a SIM card that could be utilized immediately. Being that the Z10 and my previous blackberry used differnet sized SIM cards I had to purchase a new SIM card. One the phone was activated I was suprised to find that the phone was so efficient and resourceful, but that was short lived as the phone began shutting down (powering off) on its own. Eventually the phone just stopped powering up at all, and all of this in a matter of two/three weeks. The phone was sent back by mail and I am awaiting either a new phone or reimbursement of my funds. I was very dissapointed with my purchase. Finally when I attempted to contact the store that the phone was ultimately purchased from through Amazon I could not reach any one to discuss this defective phone.",Very_Bad

I sent it in for repair -- only to find out that my limited warranty does not cover damage from ""excessively moist air"" or water. I did not damage my phone with water. I guess the damage was caused by all the excessive rain occurring in the East Coast. Nokia phones are expensive, and I could have purchased quite a number of remarkable phones with better features, applications, software, etc., etc., for a lot less $$$ -- but yet I was loyal to Nokia. Needless to say, Nokia is not repairing or replacing my phone -- and hence, I will never purchase another Nokia phone or product in this lifetime.",Very_Bad

Some of you may say ""oh its just the carrier"" but I literally took the sim out of my old phone, put in this one and activated it.

Although amazon has been a pain latetly also... So I'm scared if i try to return it I won't get my money for months. Anyway bad purchase don't buy unless you like to look flashy with a piece of crap.

When I tried for warranty replacement, I found out that this was not actually a blue iPhone; the original seller had taken a pink iPhone and put a blue cover on it.

Then, 2 days ago, i turn my phone off, and turn it back on, like i have always done, and my storage card is damaged. And i would LOVE to know how since the phone has NEVER been wet, or dropped! I come back on here to try to contact the seller, and i can't. The title CLEARLY says warranty, but only a 30 day one? I sank $200 into this phone, and it doesn't work now, for NO reason?!Do NOT waste your money on this phone, seems now i see all the reviews of SEVERAL phones doing the SAME thing, around the SAME period of time.

"On the surface, it seemed as though it would work. Nice screen, initially booted up until I tried to call it. This product never did work for me. I tried it several times with existing SIM card and new SIM cards even multiple carriers (AT&T and Verizon). Then it even eventually stopped booting up. Not a worthy product of purchase whatsoever -- a real waste of the money spent. By the time I threw in the towel and tried to return it, I got the message ""time for returning this item has expired"" by one day. I wish I had paid closer attention to the small print saying that I had a limited time to return the product. I would not recommend purchase of it.",Very_Bad
"The phone arrived to my address very quickly, but I quickly noticed that all of the phone's documentation and its interface was in Portuguese (I double-checked just now; there's no indication in the description of the product that everything is in Portuguese). Fortunately, the people at the AT&T store were able to figure out how to change the language of the phone to show English. However, upon getting ready to plug it in to charge up for the night, I noticed that there appeared to be no power cord for the phone. There were a couple miscellaneous parts that didn't seem to go together in any way whatsoever (I can't really be sure since all of the instructions are in Portuguese), and neither of the parts look like the search results when I google for blackberry curve 9360 power cords.Being able to charge the phone is kind of important. If this can't be rectified immediately, I want a full refund.",Very_Bad

I purchase the LG KP500 Cookie Phone in April of 2010. One year later this phone has been nothing but a piece of junk. I was so excited about getting the phone. The touch screen has always been slow to respond once touched. The touch screen is currently inoperable which doesn't allow me to use the phone. I haven't used the phone in 2 months and when I turned it back on thinking just maybe the touch screen would respond...nope...this found is dead.I never like to spend my hard earn money on a product that doesn't last 1 good year.,Very_Bad

It will either lock up or shut down randomly, the apps on it want to work every other day, some phone calls don't ring and when you miss them, they don't show a missed call. The biggest issue is when it locks up though. it happens when my phone runs dead. I will charge it and try and boot it up, but doesn't work. they tell you to force restart, doesn't work. by the end of it the phone decides it wants to work and you don't know how the hell it turned back on.

"It worked great for one month and since then has only been s***ier. After bad, it gets worse and worse. Among the main problems there is that keys keep being pressed while locked (for example in your pocket) so every time you need it your phone you need to go through an identification process because it thinks you have been trying to enter the passcode too many times. It is also super slow and crashes all the time. I never had a phone as bad as this one.

It's a nice phone if you can get over the Chinese script all over the place even after you set it for English. The size is nice for reading but cumbersome to hold while doing anything else and there aren't many choices for cases for it. If your pushing a stroller, it doesn't fit in the cupholders or anywhere good. The touchscreen wasn't the greatest and towards the bottom by the space bar and period, I always had to press more than once. There are better apps to use than what it comes loaded with so you need to get busy downloading and customizing.

Very pixelated, washed out screen, that finds no redemption in it's needing several taps on things to register, whacky scrolling, and sometimes you'll end up clicking on something else entirely. Cheap all around, and even it's lightly modified UI is buggy! I wanted to like this because of the snazzy color that set it apart, but I have to warn potential customers -- don't do it! I can recommend their Blu R1 HD (excellent screen, slim, great price) and Blu Energy X Plus (outstanding battery endurance, better UI and build).",Very_Bad

"I concur with Mr. Love, a previous reviewer with basically similar experience.I ordered WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE NEW, my Samsung SIII 1747 white model. I set up the phone and immediately found that the phone was not taking charge fully. I figured the charger port may have had a fault so I purchased a charger docking system but to no avail. Witihn 10mins of use, the entire phone would turn hot to touch.Eventually, I carried my phone for technical review at a cellular phone company only to be notified that my phone was not an original model and that it was made up of all non-authentic parts.I still had to resort to purchase of a new Samsung SIII phone thats working perfectly.Lesson learned: take not of reviews (had I read Mr. Love's review prior, I don't think I would have bothered with this agency through which I purchased my phone)I hope those persons who are selling these faulty phones get whats coming to them!",Very_Bad

Additionally, the WFI connection on this phone kept dropping and each time I had to re-enter the password to get it to reconnect, after doing the ~ 20 times I decided this one is going back. I requested a return this evening. My family and I have several Windows Phones that work fine, so I think it is the phone.

The screen was small and the navigaqtion was too complicated when it should be simple. It was annoying how the messages would pop up. It's supposedly a texting phone but the message box would be full within 70 messages. I had to delete messages constantly which just led to me to not text as much anymore. I also couldn't set any song as a ringtone anhd was stuck with very generic tones. The screen wasn't very sensitive and within two months it stopped responding.

"Starting about 1 week after getting it, the 1st one I received would not wake up. Removing the battery only fixed the problem briefly. The only way to get it to turn on was to hold down the power button until it restarted. Finally had to factory restore it. That fixed it temporarily. After restoring it several times I returned the phone and Amazon sent me another. This one started doing it regularly a month after receiving it.

This product says OtterBox on it but does not perform like any other OtterBox I have. I have a Samsung 10.1 tablet and the buttons do not line up with the case correctly. To be more specific I have to remove the outer rubber of the case and wedge my finger in to turn the tablet on or change the volume. This has never been a problem with any of my OtterBox cases.,Very_Bad

I have been using an unlocked galaxy S4 (that was originally AT&T) for quite some time now. However, the seller had already set the S4 up for straight talk use before it was shipped. I cracked that screen so I made the purchase for this Alpha. When I was attempting to put it all together to get the setup started, I found that the SIM card slot is much too small for my already purchased SIM card for straight talk service.

"Bought two of these. One for myself and one for my husband. They work good with Page Plus, but are HORRIBLE on battery usage. As long as I don't use it (at all) it'll stay charged for about 2 days. If we use them at all during the day, they just die on you without warning (even if they were just charged in full). You can't talk on it without being plugged up to a charger. My husband fusses every day because I bought these phones. The speakers on his is busted and he can hardly have a conversation on the phones over the muffled sound the speakers produce. I would not buy this phone again and regret my purchase, LITERALLY, every day.Would give it 0 stars if I could.",Very_Bad

When I first received this phone I charged it up for 5hrs and it only got to 86%. I have ads popping up asking If I want to download one app or another. I dont know where that came from since I have not downloaded anything to this phone. The speaker phone sucks and my time will not stay at proper setting. The screen seems to detect ""improper taps"" if you will. I can tap the call button and it opens messages. For such a big phone this should not be a problem. The only thing that I hate to have to return is the leather case. Its awesome, other than that _ÙÔ__ÙÔ__ÙÔ_",Very_Bad

A bit more torn up than i would have been ok with but the major issue i have is that by putting the phone on silent/vibrate it DOES NOT mute the shutter sound when you take pictures which is a major issue in my book as most if not all normal iphones do mute it when you put it on vibrate. Another major problem i had was that it does not come with all the original accessories as it says towards the top of the page but below that it is briefly stated that it in fact does not come with all original accessories.,Very_Bad

HTC indicated that the motherboard is probably bad. This was an ATT phone and I put it on a T-Mobile network.

"Made of pure grade 1 Chinesium. Cameras both suck at 5mp, Android thinks they are 8mp so it looks like moosh. Volume buttons do not necessarily control the thing you intend to control. Example, with YouTube playing, the volume buttons control the call volume, and when you use hangouts it changes the notification volume. It can't handle hangouts well, your friends video will be very unstable. Not to mention the deceptive looking screen size... It has a fat black border...1/5 would not bang again.",Very_Bad

"This phone is the worst phone I ever had. The reasons:- Incredibly slow, laggs and often times does not react at all to power button or touch commands- I cant take calls, whenever I am being called and I swipe to pick up it declines- When I place acall the screen turns black and does not turn on again- The phone gets very hot and wastes lots of energy. With minimal use the battery is drained within 4 hoursThis is just a small part of what`s wrong with this phone. Additionally I had to send it in for repair because in did not register whenever the headphones were unplugged.",Very_Bad

I wanted to switch the phone to my phone company provider and they couldn't have many hours, so I proceeded to the nearby Apple store for assistance. I was told by Apple the phone I bought from this company was indeed not going to work, but it was defective and I should return it.

(Organized by sent and received and not by conversations.)When I ordered this and remembered this annoying inbox, I decided I could tolerate it. However, this particular phone f'd up quite a lot for a phone that was advertised as functional. At one point, I couldn't send messages or make calls and had to restart the phone. Then I decided, fine, I'll just return it.This company has not only sent me a faulty phone, but when I put in a return request, I was asked to pay for postage and a restocking fee. So, no, I won't be returning this phone. I'm just going to sell it myself for parts because this is ridiculous and no one should have to go through the same process I did with this phone again.

It actually showed it was 'off'.Third I was send a USED phone with a long black hair stuck to the charger baggie, no instruction book, no standard screen protective laminates on the screen or the camera lens (this has been standard for 10 years or so), and there is a dent on the camera bezel as well as a scratch or chip on the camera lens.

I charged it again and DID NOT USE it only to discover that there was some type of battery drain. I contacted amazon and they refunded my card and i bought another one. Now, I see that the same problem is occurring. the battery is draining with no use. It might be a design flaw or need a new firm ware update.

At first it would go black if I was on it for more than 30 seconds now the screen keeps fading black everytime I try to unlock it and will randomely shut off.

"The seller is a fraud. The phone is not able to be connected to the Verizon network; I tried two different Verizon Wireless stores and both stores informed me that the phone I purchased from the seller was not compatible with the Verizon network. Also, the actual phone does not have the Verizon symbol on the front of the phone like the picture shows. The Verizon Wireless service representative said the Verizon symbol also helped identify whether the phone can be hooked up to Verizon's network. I challenge the seller to prove me wrong.",Very_Bad
"Everything went wrong. I`m not saying that there was a bad intention on behalf of the sales people (because they tried everything to help me get it going) But it just was not unlocked, and had a very poor experience due to the fact that I was traveling and had no time to replace it. Finally I had to stay with my iphone 4 (which I still have). Amazon attitude was not as expected, but they followed the process. I was promised a full reimboursement, because it was not unlocked as published, that included my expenses for shipping, and they did not comply. Better to forget experience.",Very_Bad

When i was scrolling up and down, if my fingers accidentally brushed the green call button it would call the last person i called. contacts and game scores and texts get erased if the battery falls out. hard to turn on at first. i recommend NOT GETTING THIS PHONE. also the layout is different than most phones so it took me months to interpret completely. that was a waste of my time.

Got it on cyber monday. Phone came with screen that would stop working intermittently. After talking to Amazon a couple times there were no more in stock. They also didn't think they were getting any in at all. So only option was to talk to Samsung or send it back and find another deal on a nice phone. Samsung was hard to deal with on the phone. felt like I was talking to someone who was reading a script. After all of that they said they would need the phone for about a week to look at it. Feeling like I would be told that I simply dropped the phone or something I am sending it back to Amazon. Total waste of time.,Very_Bad
Power button stopped working after 9months use. The phone is useless without power button. Can't turn on the phone anymore.,Very_Bad
"This was my second time buying an iphone on Amazon as the previous one was blacklisted. Upon arrival, I noticed that this ""refurbished"" product never had its screen installed properly. I could push the screen on the bottom right corner, indicating that the screen itself wasn't 100% in tact. I will be returning it as I didn't sign up for that. Also, the screen is starting to not register my movements, which sucks.",Very_Bad
"The device is Ok, but my discomfort is that it was sent with a wall charger of UK and an adaptor for USWhy the device sold in US is delivered with a charger used in other country?Perhaps do not exist in this country chargers Samsung?It's really very uncomfortable using the charger, plus is very large.",Very_Bad
"Worst experience buying a phone, ever.Charger was broken, camera doesn't work nor do any camera apps in fact if you even try to use it the whole phone flips out, and the keyboard is barely functional.

Handset is new, but also not with original package.The phone have no scratch but smells bad, doesn't have the new one's taste. But it is unlocked and seems new.

"I must say I have all ways had good luck with Amazon, BUT when I had a defective purchase [Jitter Bug phone] they charged me a RESTOCKING fee. This is not right. You should stand behind your products, and make your customer whole. Now if I decided I was not happy with a purchase , then I can see it, maybe. This unscrupulous practice makes me want to buy some where else. What say U.After arguing with some 1 @ amazon for 15 minutes they finally give me a $13. + credit on my next purchase. My concern is does this same policy apply to the hundreds of dollars I have spent with Amazon in the past year, or so. That's the question I would like an answer to. AMAZON ARE YOU LISENING ?",Very_Bad

I ran with it in my pocket and it go a little sweaty, but no LG claims it is ""water damage"" and they refuse to fix the problem. I cannot believe that anyone would not stand behind a product like this. If I dropped it in water I would admit it and bit the bullet and buy a new phone but I will not pay to fix a phone that broke from normal use. If a phone is so sensitive to water that it breaks from using it when working out that is complete idiocy. I'm not sure how I am supposed to do anything different when running.

Constant dropping of both bluetooth and cellular signals. I bought this thing for the camera (passable, but not worth the junk phone its chained to. But then the camera stopped working 8 months after I bought it anyway). I think Microsoft is being infiltrated by Google/IOS idiots who are running this platform into the ground, if the constantly decreasing functionality caused by the constant updates are any indication. Garbage. Shame on you Nokia and MS. Bye bye windows phone. This paperweight has driven me to Android.",Very_Bad

The first phone was extrememly slow, contact lists would get lost (synced w/Google), text messages may or may not come through or send, and I continually had to power off the phone to ""reboot"" and begin working correctly again. So, I requested a replacement phone, stating the first was defective. The second phone, was better, but was still slow, and at times would stop making/receiving calls and texts, and needing to be rebooted. I gave up and sent both phones back and bought a better quality smartphone.",Very_Bad

"the phone I purchased through Amazon could not be used by me and was already assigned a phone number and after much running around to Verizon stores, I had to return the phone through the postoffice - a huge inconvenience. . It was a very upsetting experience and I do not understand how Amazon could sell me a blackberry that was already in use with another and had an assigned phone number in place. The inconvenience and bad faith I experienced made me think Amazon is not selling products that customers can always use. I am dealing with a serious bone fracture and this made everything worse. Why would I use Amazon again for anything? Suzanne Hebron",Very_Bad
Because the charger was broken the phone hardly worked right waste of time and money not sure about your phones,Very_Bad

"Used to be a great phone years ago. I bought this for my mom as a transition closer to a smart phone. The phone had issues receiving texts and would often shut down when you tried to open a text. The charging cable also didn't seem to fit quite right. I thought maybe this www a faulty phone so I had Amazon send me another new one to try and it did the same exact thing! I'm guessing that despite it being a new device, the software and basic parts of the phone are still technically old as I don't believe they are manufactured anymore. I would not recommend this phone anymore.",Very_Bad
"Worked fine the first few months but then started to malfunction. It overheats A LOT. Started to not charge anymore. When it would charge it would die within 30 minutes or maybe less (not being dramatic at all). Headphones were okay. The charger sucked and the battery sucked. No cases so no protection from damage (the case that came with it was crappy). Took decent pictures. Overall, I would not recommend.",Very_Bad
No way this phone is new like it said when I purchased it. The phone is constantly turning off by itself. Always freezing up. This phone sucks.,Very_Bad

So glad it wasn't next to my face... I've contacted BLU and hopefully they respond in a timely manner. Considering their support hours are very short, I'm not expecting to hear anything anytime soon.

Then it started not connecting to WiFI at my daughters houses or mine. When I rebooted it I lost everything and had to reload my ringtone, wallpaper and all apps. Now I only have 3 apps on it and it is running slow. The people at the Verizon stores I have taken it to said that is was not a new phone and it was not refurbished either. I have taken it to 3 different Verizon stores and they all said the same thing. I actually hate this phone and will never ever order another one on this site. As soon as I find another phone, I will be returning this to you to dispose of as you see fit. A very unsatisfied customer.",Very_Bad

I'm a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and I was on the second to last hole here. It's thicker and heavier than I expected, but I think I would get used to it.The Good: Even though I didn't want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iPhone 6. I could get my music, even though it wasn't very loud. I liked the idea of an FM radio. Even though the headphones didn't fit, good sound quality.",Very_Bad

It crashes and the screen will not come back on. Many people who purchased these 16gb gt-n7100 have had complete device failures.

"I previously left feedback about this phone from iCellPhones. The phone worked fine, but the battery would not work and was incredibly beat up. I had to order a replacement battery and have yet to even be able to use the phone at all. The seller named ""Miles"" emailed me and ask to fix my problem, which was great! However, after not being able to reply for two days, Miles from iCellPhones took my personal number and text messaged me about fixing my problem and removing my negative feedback. While some may think he was trying to go above and beyond to help me out, I took it as a ridiculous attempt to remove negative feedback. I do not appreciate having my number used for text messaging-- especially at the end of the month. Not only did I have to jump through hoops to get this phone working at all, I also had to pay overage fees through my cell company for the 4 text messages I received. Ridiculous.",Very_Bad

"When you download games from google play store it wants you to download google play which is usually the way it works. Problem is, if you do that then you have no room for any other apps whatsoever. I even added a 16 GB SD card and it still won't work. You can set the phone to send all downloads and data to the sad cardand that won't even work. I had to factory reset the phone to clear it out for my daughter to download a music playing app. Even then she can only add two games if they are small ones. Can't add YouTube or even the new Pokemon game. Big bummer for her. She can use it as a phone though. Lol. If you just want a phone and maybe a app or two then it works as long as you don't download google play services. I guess it's up to you.",Very_Bad

The phone arrived ontime. The phone was locked and I was mislead by seller as he sold the phone advirtising as it's unlocked. I had to spend approx $80 to unlock the phone. I am very disappointed with this purchase as seller should have mentioned about the lock system upfont.,Very_Bad

"1. Unboxing the phone, the box was missing the SILICONE TRANSPARENT PROTECTIVE CASE2. I "" turned on"" the cellphone and it sounds like its "" turning on"" but the screen is only showing a BLACK LIGHTED SCREEN.. i have pressed the buttons and they give sound, so most likely the screen is faulty.IN THE PICTURE, THE PHONE IS SUPPOSEDLY "" ON"" IS ALL I GET.I need a REFUND ASAP.",Very_Bad
"It's funny, more and more I'm realizing the *negative* reviews seem to be the most valid on Amazon, as they are the ones that have actually used the product for any length of time. Even if they are in the vast minority, those reviewers are almost always right.Anyways...I have no idea how so many people rated this so highly? The screen protector nearly renders your iPhone useless. You have to press SO hard! Totally ruins the functionality of the phone. I tried to use the case for a few weeks hoping somehow it would settle in. No such luck. I also wrongly assumed with the popularity of OtterBox that I was somehow overlooking something. Nope. Maybe previous versions of the OtterBox were better, but this case is majorly flawed. I'm sure it will protect your phone, it's a huge bumper! But otherwise it's impractical to use. Luckily Amazon has a great return policy within 30 days, otherwise I would have wasted $23 bucks.",Very_Bad
"Bought this for my wife. After about 10 months, the phone started acting up with various problems. One problem is that the screen would go black after a phone call, which made it impossible to hang up (if the other party didn't hang up). Of course, this also meant that nothing else could be done. After a few minutes the screen would come back on again, but in very unpredictable fashion. Sometimes, when turning the phone on, the screen would light up then immediately go dark. This happens repeatedly. I looked on the problem online, and it appears to be fairly common. Really unacceptable for a former flagship phone to have such serious problems.I realize that there aren't too many G2s around anymore, since LG is soon likely to move on to the G5, but I would still caution getting a used or refurbished model of this phone.",Very_Bad

"When it worked (both of them: each developed the same problem) they were fine. Problem is, about 6 months into ownership the volume went down. This happened on both. On the first one I was unaware there was a code to reset it, so I got a new one and tossed the first. Second one got so quiet, I reset it to the code supplied on the internet. This worked ONCE, but when volume went down the 2nd time, I gave up. NOT worth the money unless you have hearing like Superman. Rugged? Yes, but what value is that if you can't hear the damned thing.",Very_Bad

I bought this phone last year. The dual card function never worked. The speakers went dead within months of the purchase. I would definitely not recommend this non-USA phone. It is sold out of China or Korea and is not covered by Samsung USA warranty. It is not cost effective to send it to China if something goes wrong. These phones are really a piece of junk.,Very_Bad
So this phone says that it is compatible with Verizon but IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON. My phone got stolen and I needed a phone for work and other necessary reasons and Amazon screwed me over.

Wi-fi is fine, but would be nice if the stock messaging app worked. Camera is ok. It's far below the iPhone 6 or 7, and the best Samsungs as well, but it's fine for a cheap phone.

"The phone was in very good shape when i bought it but it was LOCKED!!!!(European phone).The description in the title on Amazon clearly mentioned that the phone was 'unlocked'. That was not the case.

The customer service was helpful but the code that they provided for unlocking the phone did not work. Again, a very disappointing experience overall since i bought this for a friend who had to travel overseas... Please ask point-blank questions before you buy from this vendor...",Very_Bad

Does not support anything faster than HSPA (i.e. much slower than 4 G) in the US. Have had this exact phone for 2 weeks. No way around getting a better signal. Frequently loses all **phone**signal. Including any emergency calling capability. Sometime NO data access at all. I could be standing next to the cellphone tower in a major city!! My old phone had 4G LTE. Not for use in this country (USA).,Very_Bad
"Turned out not to be what it was listed as. It turned out to be a previously used phone in the UK which wasn't completely unlocked and can't be because it was used on a UK wireless network. So if you're trying to use this in the states, all you'll be able to do is text and receive calls with no access to any data. I actually had to call HTC for them to tell me this.",Very_Bad
There was something wrong with the phone. I had already sent it to my country before I realized there was a black mark on the top of the screen. Spent a lot of t of money on it now I can return it_Ù÷Ó,Very_Bad
"Bought the phone July of 2015. After 10 months, the phone completely stopped working. I tried contacting the seller for advice on what to do. It hasn't even been a year and the phone stopped working!! Would definitely not recommend buying a international phone as not only can you do nothing if something like this happens, but I'm assuming the parts used for these devices are much cheaper and so may not last long. I took very good care of the phone, no drops or water damage. This was clearly a Samsung related issue. Will not buy from this seller again or an international phone. It is worth spending the extra $100 to buy a US phone and with a 1 year warranty!!",Very_Bad
Honestly I was shocked when I received the device. I thought it's a brand new phone. But unfortunately it's not. The phone was refurbished and even the battery is not the original one. Also the accessories that come with the phone is not the original. All in all I am not satisfiedRegards,Very_Bad
"This is the worst product ive bought from amazon to date. Imports from UAE seem to full of flaws as quality control isn't implemented at any point in the process. Thus, UAE imports are the worst copycat products made on the planet and we consumers are screwed out of our money. I actually believe this is a copycat product and not an actual real samsung phone. The phone consistently and randomly restarts over and over again. I could be texting or doing work and it shuts down or randomly restarts. I know the seller and amazon wont refund or replace my money for the product so im screwed and stuck with it. I think the next time I buy a Samsung smart phone im going to buy it in the US and directly from the manufacture.

It didn't work for me. I'm unable to unlock the screen after the initial start up when it locks. I have to keep taking the battery out to restart the device,Very_Bad
I was forced to buy this product because the one I wanted was not unlocked as advertised.

It would take 10-15 business days for them to evaluate their options. Therefore, it could take a calendar month the have a warranty claim fixed. I call Amazon to complain about the lengthy processing time. A supervisor offered to refund with a 20 percent restocking fee since the crap failed passed 30-day return window. The phone is currently on the way to Amazon. I will update this review when I have a resolution.",Very_Bad

"I did lots of research before purchasing this phone, and I was pleased with the bang for the buck when the phone arrived. Then I noticed that the Android Market was missing. The ability to add apps was my number one reason for selecting an android phone. I'm pretty tech savvy, and I invested a few hours looking into resolving the problem on my own, but found no easy way. Like other reviewers with the same issue, I had the Arabic version.In summary, I recommend the phone if you're looking for a low cost, entry level smartphone. Yes, the resolution is poor, but it's OK given the price tag. Yes, the phone can be sluggish at times, but it's not excessive and I could easily live with it. However, if you do decide on this phone, I highly recommend asking the seller if it's the Arabic version and if the Android Market app is installed.Also, keep in mind that the Wildfire S will be coming out shortly, and will have a slightly better processor and screen resolution. Of course, it will also be more expensive...",Very_Bad

The worst decision I have ever made. This phone overheats on the charger every night now and will die in a matter of an hour. I have only had this phone for 2 months and honestly things just keep getting worse. I guess that is what I get for buying a refurbished phone. It's honestly worth the extra $100 to just buy from Apple. Then at least you know it will work and you can have them fix it or bring it back if it doesn't. I'm very disappointed.,Very_Bad

However, it is unacceptable to pay so much for a phone, which will last less than a year.Now I am looking for a new phone... I'd love to buy a newer version of Sony Xperia Z3 or Z5. However, really worry that the same issue of spontaneously cracked screen will happen again with my new phone if I'll buy it, as the owners of Sony Xperia Z3 or Z5 also report this happening to them..The issue does not appear to be fixed by Sony..So sad, as the phone is really amazing.. i would have rate it 5 stars, if not the screen issue.Interestingly, the screen on the outside is completely smooth, i.e the crack is NOT on the outside of the screen, the crack is deeply INSIDE of the screen..",Very_Bad

Very disappointed in this otter box. The description said white/pink. You would assume it was white with maybe some pink on edges or back. That was not the case. It had a really cheap design on the back and one of the corners of the design wasn't glued down well. I assumed the cheap picture/decal came off since it was peeled down on the corner. After pulling part if it off I realized it was made to stay on. Now I have a gray back with glue all over it. This is my first bad experience with Amazon. The ugly picture on back should be shown before you purchase it. Very disappointed.,Very_Bad

I initially thought I would get better at it but after a few weeks my texting speed is still awful.

I loved this phone, but I never would have spent the money on it that I did if I'd known that I would get only three months use out of it. I also purchased an otterbox case for it at the same time. I never dropped the phone, got it near liquid, or caused damage to it in any way. But now I own and expensive HTC Windows 8 phone paper weight.Of course it would die after the 30 days return period, I am not pleased with this purchase or the seller either at this point.

So I've return it and ordered this one instead(only because it had reviews that it's identical to an Otterbox). And it really is.""Fogeek PC TPU Combo Protective case for IPhone 6 Plus & 6s plus"". I've typed all this review with the cover on and zero problems. Plus it's 12.99$ with prime shipping(bonus).",Very_Bad
"I bought this for someone who works in construction. It falls on a daily bases and has not taken any damage to date. The writing on the screen is kinda small and cannot be adjusted. It is also impossible to remove the phone from the belt clip before it stops ringing. And you can't use it in the clip since the clip covers some of the buttons. The charger and the headset uses two different ports yet the connector is exactly the same. These ports are also located next to each other sometimes causing confusion, especially in the dark.UPDATE** After just 6 months the rubber case has begun peeling off. Other folks at work are complaining about the same issue and Sonim says its cosmetic damage and the warranty does not cover cosmetic damage although the peeled of parts means that the device is no longer water and dust proof.",Very_Bad
Ahhh purchased this and currently the screen is only showing half screen... Any suggestions on what could be wrong??? May I return for replacement???,Very_Bad
"When the product arrives seems to be perfect but 45 days after the software start having troubles. Gps doesn't work, time and date is impossible to set properly, touch panel fails, volume adjustment doesn't work",Very_Bad
Junk I have nothing but problems with this phone it randomly shuts off the screen flickers and it gets extremely hot the battery also never holds a charge I've owned $20 phones that are alot better than this one,Very_Bad
the phone is not a refurished phone it a used phone will never but them again nextel rugged motrola I680,Very_Bad
"it's not a new phoneI have never had such a poor shopping experience, description of goods which are new, but what does refurbished. And workmanship is very rough. Junction do not fit, a prominent 1-2mm. The battery cover can not close completely. Too bad!",Very_Bad
I had to first find a battery that would fit it then I had to buy two different sim cards to make it work and then would had to have changed carriers I did not under stand the term of unlocked phone I still don't think I do so I bought a nother phone from the us put this on in the trash where it belongs!!!!!,Very_Bad
I ordered this phone for my girlfriend after looking thru all the other phone online I thought this phone was the best over all value. I myself have the nexus 4 but side by side the life plays screen is little bigger CPU and ram are pretty equal ROM is low but unlike the nexus 4 this phone has a micro SD slot. So if your looking for a great unlocked android phone this is a prefect choice.So now after one week of use the power connection would only charge if the cable was tilted to the front of the phone. Today after a week and a half phone won't take any charge at all its not the cable either I've tried 4 other chargers.,Very_Bad
I did not understand why amazon is selling this archaic phone in modern era. DO NOT BUY IT OR REGRET IT LATER,Very_Bad
"Bought this from Amazon. The description is deceptive. States ""unblocked"" so you would think it is compatible with any provider. Not the case. The carrier has to provide a sims card, and this technology is not compatible with sprint.Once I discovered this, seller would not let me return the product, either. Ended up giving this to an associate that had verizon. Buyers Beware!",Very_Bad
The speaker is in the back so it is difficult hearing. Volume does not loud enough. Callers cannot hear so using earphone is the only option to speak clearly.,Very_Bad
Returned as soon as I got it. Product was clearly scratched and many parts ( buttons ) didn't work,Very_Bad
i got these model of blackberry 9810 in this web site its docent came in the original paquege and the free he'd done thats was bonus docent came and i get on my cell done some application instal end i and the battery it was in here paquege,Very_Bad
"Buying this phone was a terrible mistake. it made no sense because I was told that the phone was factory unlocked, when it was blocked to be used with any provider, meaning that the phone was marked as LOST/STOLEN. My advice to all you costumer is DO NOT TRUST.",Very_Bad
Don't even think of purchasing this device. Overheats all the time and the camera doesn't even come close to the IPhone 6 with half the pixel count. Can't believe Sony is still selling a device that they know over heats. I should of returned this as soon as it arrived. This is by far my worst purchase ever.,Very_Bad
This phone is garbage and am pissed. Bought this phone saying unlocked got it in some weird language still can't figure it out am realm pissed off,Very_Bad
"This was the worst experience ive ever had buying online. The phone started heating instantly after i turned it on, about 5 mins after that, it was so overheated that burned my hand.I got a message on the phone that asked me if i wanted to reinstall the apps i had before the restoration (so im guessing this phone was used)It started reseting itself every 5 mins.The back of the phone looks like a toy cellphone. I have friends who have lg g3 and its good quality, what i recieved was a joke and a dangerous device.",Very_Bad
"I bought the phone thinking it was original and began to fail next month, will not work multitasking key and home , nor receive calls . I took it for service and was told that the phone is refurbished and it have software problems, it not accept reinstall software",Very_Bad
"Truly rugged phone; I threw it on the ground and it survived the shock, however, I am disappointed because after few weeks of usage, it goes off on its own, switches off and never comes back on unless switched on. So, it has stopped working. I would not recommend for anyone who wants to buy a working phone.",Very_Bad
"im unable to used because is locked to european sim cards only, i'd be ok when the phone is unlocked and then i can change rate",Very_Bad
Buuuu they advertised it as LTE and does not work in US and MX... This is like fraud... They later change the title... Lame and super expensive...,Very_Bad
"Item did not meet my need, the item was defective when it said it was supose to be working fine. Their hard to comunicate with, i would not buy from them again.",Very_Bad
It has shut off and not turned back on for over an hour twice now. I am unable to choose different ringtones for different apps. (Emails and texts) are the same my phone calls quite often drop when I have full signal. My texts messages don't always go through a lot of times I have to receive a message or send an additional one before they will send,Very_Bad
this phone is the pits very bad no service once I left Phoenix to LA no service everybody else that had the same carrier as me had service once I got to LA had to walk out to parking lot at hotel to get service very bad device,Very_Bad
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",Very_Bad
"Be very careful when buying this phone. It came on time, before I left for Europe, but the phone was not unlocked as advertised. When I came to Europe and tried to use it with European SIM card it didn't work at all. I contacted the seller, who sent me unlocking code which didn't work too. They told me then to send it back to them.However, to cut the long story short, I couldn't use it when I needed the most.",Very_Bad
"Very disappointed. Pre ordered the white with 16/2 IM/RAM. Waited weeks for delivery only to be told it was not availabIe. I ended up getting the white with less memory only to see the dark blue with increased memory available afterwards.Overall I thought it was a good phone from BLU but..... Battery life not great. Had phone for more than a week and the battery has to be recharged every day. 4G LTE a must. Really makes a difference. I had the Blu Energy X Plus before, love the 5.5"" screen and 4000mAh battery but it was not 4G LTE.BLU can't seem to get it just right.5.5"" screen, 16/2 memory, 4G LTE and a 4000-5000 mAh battery. Every other possible combination is available. Come on BLU get it right.1 Month Update - This phone has a tendency to just reboot itself at random. It will not receive MMS's unless you clear/delete other MMS to /from other contacts. I guess the memory fills up so quickly. Overall this is a real piece of GARBAGE. I would not buy this phone. Stay away.",Very_Bad
"did not last a week and seller wouldnt refund, wish it had a zero stars thats what i would rate it...",Very_Bad
"Received a used phone with over seven hundred hours of talk time on it. Was suppose to receive a new phone, not a used one.",Very_Bad
after about a week or so the lock button keep sticking I would not get this if I was you keep looking elsewhere,Very_Bad
Low end product and appropriately noted as no warranty. I would not recommend this defective product as it is not supported by the seller.,Very_Bad
It didn't work on T-Mobile.I was told it would. Not.I give -1.Please don't ask me a 3rd time.Thx,Very_Bad
"I purchased 2 phones which supposed to be new. One of them worked fine, the second one was not new. It was damaged. The SIM Card holder was missing a contact. The phone was not unlocked. I contacted the vendor's direct phone line and they never got back with me. I already spent $75.00 in getting it to work. I am currently in the Dominican Republic where I brought both phones as a gift to relatives. I will be back in the US this Saturday and will write a detail review. Again this was the worst online purchase I ever made.",Very_Bad
"When i first got my rogue other people had trouble hearing me thought it was there phone but after 2 weeks of it people could not here me at all plus the phone charger was not good had to buy new charger also, So I went out to radio shack pick out a new phone out for 49.95 with a 2 year contract and now i should be all set first time buying off amazon like this I bet its my last time used phone 65.00 new charger 10 bucks spent 75.00 new phone with new charger 49.00 u do the math",Very_Bad
"The phone does not work, I have used one month, after the touch does not work and ot has problems with the signal. I've done all the tests and apparently is the phone.",Very_Bad
"The phone was not new, although it was supposed to be. Someone installed a screen protector (crooked), the Samsung logo at the top was partially scratched off and there were several scratches on the sides of the phone and underneath the battery cover.",Very_Bad
very bad experience the phone never works I'm still waiting from seller for my money back,Very_Bad
Terrible! Trouble and not working at all now!!!! It was slow and froze all the time. I would appreciate a full refund of my money. I spent over $300. On the phone and accessories!!!,Very_Bad
The phone arrived as expected but the phone could not work on the Verizon network. I had to return the phone. The seller processed the return with no problem,Very_Bad
Device is very bad and is likely to be inhibited .. lump this seller very bad..,Very_Bad
The buyer never said it did not work at all. Only said it had been off the charger for a week. Would not give me my money back to make it right.,Very_Bad
"Didn't work, wouldn't turn on. Doesn't inspire confidence about the build quality of these phones. Also it is very heavy for a thin phone.",Very_Bad
Phone was advertised as a sprint phone. No where was it indicated that the specific phone we received had previously been on a PRE-PAID contract and therefore not able to ever be added to a standard line of service - Sprint or otherwise. Spent way too much time on the phone with Sprint as well as driving quite a distance to a retail location only to find out the phone is useless.,Very_Bad
"WARNING! I was fooled to buy a test phone that cannot be upgraded. I thought it would be safe to buy it via Amazon, but was I ever wrong. For your benefit: You have now been notified!",Very_Bad
"åÊI bought this phone in October and now it no longer recognize the SIM card ... I thought it was because I went card and T-Mobile and they have given me a new card, but it seems that the problem is the phone. From Settings vanished everything related to mobile networks. I tried to make factory data reset and nothing was solved ...What can I do in this case?",Very_Bad
Charger is not working and performance of phone is below acceptance. The product has one year warranty therefore full refund should be awarded for the defect of this product.,Very_Bad
Do not buy this phone. Battery overheats when taking phone calls causing phone to turn off.,Very_Bad
"I have been living in china for nine years. If I had wanted a Chinese phone, I would have bought it at home. A few years ago, in China, I bought a real Samsung Note2 for a good price and had no trouble registering it with Samsung.I do not appreciate getting instructions in Chinese. In my experience, phones made to sell in China are not up to the standards of phones made to sell in the US.This company should be honest about what they are selling and not dress it up as ""an international version"" without a warranty.",Very_Bad
I am tried to write but to be honest be way from these people and their times. I wasted a lots of time and money.,Very_Bad
If your desperate and need a phone this will do. Otherwise it is a terrible phone.,Very_Bad
"It was dead out of the box, even after charging the battery for 24 hours.",Very_Bad
I need you to call me asap or email me bash2355@icloud.com the phone is not unlocked,Very_Bad
Do not purchase this product it last a year or less. Learn after I bought the second one which last 4 months.,Very_Bad
"Bought this phone in November worked well for first 3months as soon as the power gets low which is really quick, it gets super hot. And it just loves to shut down",Very_Bad
"I received the phone in the mail and it is unlocked for sure but it is NOT a Note 4 by any means, I have no idea what type of phone it is but it is a 3G network only it does not connect with my Bluetooth in my car, I really wasted my money and I am disappointed with my purchase, DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!!!",Very_Bad
"I'm not happy with this purchase.The battery is inside the phone that does not work, also got another battery in the phone box but does not fit the phone.I am from Ecuador have not done so by the return would be very expensive.",Very_Bad
"love the phone itself, did come damage with the front camera and light not working.",Very_Bad
