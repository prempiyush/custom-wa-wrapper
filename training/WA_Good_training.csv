"I bought the n82 a month ago. It's a good device,+ Excellent screen resolution+ Excellent Camera 5mp w/xenon Flash!!!+ GPS, Wifi, bluetooth+ It's nice to play games or view videos on TV using the A/V cable :)- Battery life :(- 3G is useless on USA or Dominican Republic [Where I live]",Good
"I purchased this phone and am very happy with their performance, however've seen on the internet, that all are to s6 edge dual card slim. But mine is not as I know if I can place him two slim card??THANKS",Good
I'm happy with this phone so far. Lots of features most of which I will probably not take advantage of but my main reason for the purchase was the dual sim capability. I travel extensively for work and not having to move different country sims in and out with the possibility of losing one was my objective. Subjectively I think the phone is attractive and the call quality was good. The main camera is very good as the front facing camera is just so so. It takes a micro sd card too.,Good
It's in excellent shape! I really like it! And I can recommend other customers to do business with you! (MAC LUSHIMBA),Good
"forgot to check the ram, not enuf ram, need at least 1gb or doesnt run very well. other then that is a good phone.",Good
Its gud but i didnt find out d screen protecter & Louis vuitton case coer,Good
"I had seen some reviews that said the phone was counterfeit. But I called Samsung and gave them the serial number and they confirmed it was genuine. The adapter of the charger did not work and the headset had shorts. I contacted the seller and they sent me a new charger and headset. They both work fine now. I have no problems with the phone ,",Good
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",Good
"Bought the samsung focus and i just wanna say i love everything about it, except the fact that it doesnt connect to 3g with tmobile :( i love the colors on the screen and how everything is set up. Upon opening the pbox and turning it on, i received and update for the software which was a big plus, so i now have copy and paste..Def a must buy!!!",Good
Got this fone for media and reliability. It's never let me down. Switched to Nokia 1520 due to my personal distaste for android.,Good
"The phone is very fast when open apps, feel good in my hands, the screen HD is ok only the battery is not long time but the phone is stil work great I like",Good
"This phone is great for the price, the battery is a little weak, it needs to be recharged at least twice per day, I'm currently in Vietnam and it works just great here also. I use the Google GPS function continuously so that might be the battery issue. I bought this phone, because of the dual SIM and it was the international model and so far it hasn't disappointed me.",Good
I recived my case today and immediately called the company after installing my Otterbox and noticing the way the screen protector is raised above my screen. They are sending me a new one! My mom has a pink on purchased from Walmart and she has no problems with hers I was hopeful that mine would be prefect aswell but I see it was not. But other than that I feel this case is just a good as the one I had on my galaxy S5.,Good
Used this phone on an international trip for two weeks and it did the job. Only problem is you cannot receive pictures and you will only be able to take about 5 pics on the storage space provided.,Good
"Compared to other phones I've had, this is a major upgrade. It is a great price for what you're getting. The camera on the front (selfie cam) is not too great in the dark, but the other one is great! I would recommend if you want a good phone, but you are on a budget.",Good
"I LOVE this phone. The reason i titled it "" Dinosaur "" is because AT&T doesn't make them any more. Because I didn't buy it through an AT&T supplier, I can't download pictures. This phone is the only kind of phone my husband and I care to carry. The color on this one is not a red red, it is a burgundy which is such a pretty color. I will continue buying this type phone as long as I can find them. If I wanted to use my computer, I would carry my lap top with me.",Good
"I bought 2 of this from amazon and it was delivered in a timely manner(4days even though i opted for Free Shipping which should have taken between 9-14days).The packaging was great, the phone works well even though windows mobile 6.1 sucks and the battery power is not so impressive(wont last for 24hrs if used heavily), but with a custom cooked ROM from XDA-Developers, features of the phone should really come to life and you should enjoy it.",Good
Phone is in great shape. It has a slighty erratic battery at low charges(which is a issue with this model). The Bluetooth doesn't work which isn't a issue for me. Price was great. Satisfied,Good
"I bought this phone because I was tired of smartphones, I wanted something simple and durable and that is exactly what I got.Pros:Incredibly DurableBattery lasts for daysWaterproofYou can upload your own ringtonesFlashlight on the topCons:Texting takes a while getting used otNot much memory unless you buy a micro SD cardCan't receive any picture messages or videos or participate in group chats",Good
This is a great quality product & was exactly what I was expecting from Otterbox. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the case is kind of big but they didn't have this color option in the smaller Otterbox cases.,Good
I like it. Still learning it though. Give me a couple of weeks and I'll let you know how it performed. So far so good though.,Good
"I needed a new phone and just something as fast and durable for the time being, So far this phone been working good, I don't like the fact that it has a logo for the company it came from even tho it's unlocked, I didn't like that, Everything works fine, The battery dies somewhat a bit too fast, For me personally it last about 7 hours and that's with using BBM, Twitter, Facebook etc, So with that in mind it should last twice as long without using those applications, Other then that it works simple fine and I was satisfied with my purchase, Just did not like that logo of the company, But great product otherwise, It came with a charger and a guide battery and the battery door, Did not come with a USB cable which I find was a bit of a con, Good thing I have other Data Cables, So if you're looking for a phone to use for a few months or just something casual to keep in contact, I believe this is a good buy, I would give it a 4 out of 5 for customer service.",Good
"This is the second phone I buy for my daughter gift. What I can say is that it is complete with respect to the price, which I have not flash that does not matter. The version you buy is E Xperia. sony is sony",Good
"Good phone, very nice pretty color; However, I would definately prefer that the phone comes with screen protector on it.",Good
"I love this phone. Unfortunately within the first week of purchasing my daughter dropped it and destroyed the screen, but it still works perfectly. I would definitely recommend this. As a matter of fact my husband is now thinking of purchasing one for himself. I",Good
Nice Phone for Basic Usage. It clearly connects to networks such as TMobile & AT&T in USA. Battery life is also good. Useful for Travelers worldwide.,Good
"I like it or at least I want too.For starters It didn't connect to my countries 4g cellular network sighzand it's gaming performance is sub par :/and they say 3gb ram and you'd think at least 2 would be usable but around 1.5 was... I installed Nova launcher prime and got the 2 tho...But the phone is beautiful, and some surprisingly good pictures under the right light.It's loud... That I can say with confidence...and it has some truly amazing features on it :3The screen though not the brightest IS readable outdoors... and the screen has some really nice color reproduction better than the S5...Over all the good out weight the bad EXCEPT for the 4g support... can't overlook that...",Good
"I bought two of these to switch over to Ting. I was blown away by how much phone we got for less than the quarter of the price of 1 flagship phone. They're slick, fast and light. A few minor complaints, the sim chamber was an absolute nightmare to open. You have to be very careful and very firm , otherwise you're there poking around hoping to get it open. The other complaint is the construction. It's a VERY fragile phone so be smart and get a solid case for it. If you drop it, it will crack and die, no doubt about it. Other than that super worth the price, go for it.",Good
This was a birthday gift for my daughter item arrived very well packed as to prevent damage affordable price for a quality product,Good
"Was in good condition but not ""like new"" but a great buy for the price!",Good
"Excellente producto, lo recomiendo ampliamente, es inteligente versatil, ligero practico y comodo de usar, el sistema operativo es de ultima generacion y amigable",Good
"Overall a good phone for the money. The only flip side is the ringer is not very loud. If you are around any moderately noisy place, you wont hear it ring",Good
Works great as a phone but difficult to text with so we don't use it for that.,Good
RAXR V3 is out of style but it is what I wanted and is what works for me,Good
"The phone arrived on time, with full documentation and accessories as promised. Registered it on Verizon network with no problem. Thanks for a smooth purchase.",Good
Phone is great works fine it's brand new just wish it came with headphones but it's all good,Good
"i,buy a lg g 2 a year ago very fast only i don't like is the battery after year get over heat on the backnow is kid of danger .for over heat .change the battery is complicated .",Good
"Great phone for a great price, a couple of days in and everything is working flawlessly... expect the front camera, being a VGA, it only works outside in the daytime because of the light, if looking for a good phone with a excelent front camera, don't purchase this, besides that the phone is great.",Good
"Great keyboard for these geriatric hands and eyes. I still tend to hit the ""send"" button when I just want to say ""ok"". Not too small nor large; not easy to lose. No WIFI or favorite games, like solitaire, but perfect for my needs.",Good
"good rugged construction. I will say that on the Apple iPhone 6 plus, this case makes a very big phone even bigger, that is just the way it has to be. I have had other phone cases by other manufacturers that didn't hold up to the type of use I need. So far this one seems like it will last much longer. Time will tell. It was a bit more costly but as they say, 'you get what you pay for'.",Good
Good phone that works as advertised with both sims. The sound is better using the ear buds while on the phone. Speaker could be more powerful. Ability to upgrade storage space is a plus. I particular like that I don't have to carry two phones anymore,Good
"For the price, it's not too bad. The camera is not great. It charge fast. It looks pretty slick with gold color.",Good
"This phone is very simple, but gets the basics done with orderly and quick fashion. It has pretty fast wifi and also a 5 MP camera. It does have a few flaws though. The camera does not have flash and the touchscreen is rather poor.Buy this product if you want a really basic wifi phone that works well and is reliable.",Good
"A good phone with many functions that I like. GPS is free and I can download whole world map on it. Used for a few times, surprisingly good. The only downside is locking GPS taks 2-3 minutes. Touch screen works well.The biggest disappointment is that you can NOT make it to support other languages. In my case I want it to support Chinese, if you buy this phone from US, you are out of luck. The firmware that you can install is tied with country code of phone. You can find some hacked firmware on internet, but you void your warranty. I travel to China a lot, that means I can't use it there. For people have similar needs, buy this phone from China local store.",Good
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",Good
"I've had this phone for almost eighteen months and I still love it. My phone before this was a Torch and I hadn't planned on buying another Blackberry because of the usual rumours that flew around about BB. However I hadn't even heard about this phone before, but while researching phones to see what I should get I came upon this and I was immediately sold. I had compiled a list of about 5 or 6 choices but I dropped them all when I started reading about the Z30. I still love it and I've had hardly any issues with it. The only serious issue which comes to mind is the erasing of my media card, which unfortunately I hadn't learned about until it happened to me. Since I reformatted my media card it hasn't been out of my phone and I haven't had any issues with my content. I would like another one but a better BB may come along that suits my style. Until them I'm keeping this.",Good
Pretty good replacement for my old Otterbox case! NOT a authentic Otterbox though! I couldn't turn my phone facing out and snap it in place like I could with the real Otterbox!,Good
It works great. Not much info when u are buying the item. It does not come with a charger. I give it for stars because there wa no charger,Good
I received my phone but the charger is for internanationl I need a charger for us how can I get one I only. Need the plug in part. Order num is 1059333. Item num is 2A-5s5n-oj5m its for the samsung s4 mini Thank,Good
"I got this phone as a gift for my uncle. Since he does not ask too much, this phone is the best for him. The screen is wide enough for watching youtube videos and social network. However, this phone does not support Tmo 4G LTE.",Good
Great off brand phone. My phone is great but I tried to order two more and it didn't turn out like mine. It's the luck of the draw.,Good
Is a good phone for the price but still runs Android 2.3 gingerbread which is out dated and cannot be upgraded. Also sometimes gets bogged down and takes a few extra seconds to load. Keyboard is very fumctional though and camera is pretty decent. Would recommend getting the droid 4 if you could afford it.,Good
"I couldn't afford a brand new phone, I have straight talk and can't pay 300-500 out of pocket so I took a chance on a refurbished one. Came in good condition. The battery doesn't last as long as I expected, I'm sure because it's refurbished. Still get a good day and a half out of it though... Only real complaint is that the speakers seem... Fuzzy? ONLY when recording a video though. The phone speakers are fine but when I record something with this device and replay it, it sounds like I cranked the bass. Overall, good phone for $180 vs however much it costs brand new",Good
"The product looked good for being refurbished. I am not the user of it, gave it to my son, and he was happy with it.",Good
"it was good (I use ""was"" because someone slammed it to the ground and it broke), but the only thing I don't like about this is that it doesn't have chinese as a language. Since I bought this for my father, he can't read english and so I had to download 3 other apps to change most of the phone to chinese.",Good
"This phone replaces a RAZR V3 that i've had since they first came out some years ago. The phone still works. However, it shows the ravages of a hard life as my companion. I dropped it in the snow and, dropped it everywhere else, but every time i dropped her, she came up fully functional. I like the size, shape, feel and I am familiar with its features. My only disappointment with this new phone is that the selection of ring tones is sadly deficient. The tone that i have enjoyed for years 'Sky Blue' is not among those that come within settings, and overall the selections available are significantly fewer than what was offered on my original phone. But I guess I'll get used to it. If any one knows if/where i might download this ring tone the info would be appreciated. D. ColÌ_n",Good
i like it. Not as heavy as the 920 . However it came in spanish - even the instructions - no English instructions at all. phone was advertised as international version so why was no English included? Had to go on the internet to find out how yo convert to English.,Good
good phone for older users that like the big keys and easy to use features. also has a long battery life.,Good
"Many receive phone dust, unlike like new, very serious Diaoqi card pin no data line is also replaced, not original",Good
"the article was not as it is described, the screen did not have the logo of LG seemed that would have changed the touch",Good
its not the newest thing out there... but i have not had any issues with it. I like this phone and maybe one day.. when this is broken i will get another galaxy model.,Good
"First one came without a battery, second one was scratched on the side frame more than the first....",Good
It came right on time. It is pretty scratched up but nothing you can't hide under a case. It works fine.,Good
"If you're looking for a phone to text or call, maybe do a little facebook scrolling this is fine, but if you are a person who is always on your phone doing everything, don't get this. It's pretty slow and somewhat laggy, sometimes even unresponsive right away. I mean it works, it's just not the best. I gave it four stars because it is cheap, and for what you get its a pretty god price.",Good
"Well i purchased this phone as a gift. I wanted to send it overseas and since they dont have such phone, its the best deal.Product quality is good. Good for people who text a lot.It was already unlocked.I dont know what else to say, since i did not use it more that few hours.The best part is its very low price, and you can change color of it by changing its back cover!",Good
I ordered a black one but got a white one and it has like a dot when I take pictures but it's a good phone,Good
"While it's unlocked, ours came loaded with AT&T bloatware which you can't get rid of without rooting it. Eventually I might do that but only after being sure I won't kill it. It's a very sharp phone though and for the price, in comparison to an iPhone 6+, it's worth any hassle you have with it.",Good
SLOW INTERNET BUT ITS SPEEDING UP. OTHER THEN THAT I LIKE IT. BUT IM GOING TO GO BIGGER NEXT TIME,Good
"So far, I love this phone. It definitely took some getting used to but once I got used to the phone, it was great for me. What I DO NOT like about this phone is the warranty, and the warranty options from this company. There is only a 1 year warranty and the outside warranties are not that great. Hopefully this phone will continue to do its job. Also, the battery life stinks. Whatever they describe on the website as far as battery life is either a lie, or only for people who use this phone only to talk and NEVER open any apps or text. So overall I am satisfied, and it is the best phone I have ever had....just hate the battery life. I will update if anything changes.",Good
After reading other reviews I decided to take the leap and purchase a BLU phone. I don't regret it yet (only had it a few days). The one downside so far that is ridiculous is the short battery life! So the 4 stars are solely due to the battery life being sucky! I'll update my review in a month or so on the overall phone features and such.,Good
"I am a late adopter. I am such a late adopter that I don't have a data plan but jump from wi-fi to wi-fi spot. I need a phone with solid hardware and simple tasks like listen to podcast. The phone battery needs to be charged daily. My ex BLU phone needed charging every 3 days. Most of the battery energy is consumed by Google Play services which I don't use often ( no data plan ) but oh well. Is my first OLED phone so I'm impressed with the graphics. The mechanics of this phone are pleasant ( weight, size, responsiveness ).",Good
"Excelente Telefono, no tiene nada que envidiarle a un iphone, gran cantidad de aplicaciones en Android Market, muy rapido, interface intuitiva, hasta ahora todas las aplicaciones se ejecutan muy bien, lo he probado con sim cards de los 3 operadores telefÌ_nicos en Venezuela y funciono adecuadamente, el Ì¼nico inconveniente que se debe tener en cuenta es lo poco que dura la bateria , opte por comprar un cargador de automovil ,en definitiva excelente inversiÌ_n.",Good
Works very well. No problems switch from old Android phone. Glad I made the purchase.,Good
"Got this using my Amazon Prime so came within two days! I didn't expect to also get TWO HUGE gifts from the seller that consisted of a stuff animal, flowers, and candy! Absolutely took me by surprise! I've been trying to get used to this phone, I had an Ipod 5 to start with and this is absolutely big but I love it! I can also still use my selfie stick and it works great! The camera quality is a bit okay honestly it can be a bit fuzzy but for the price and such it's pretty decent and it's just a camera, want something high quality go to Apple! I like it since it can do the stuff I need it to do.",Good
"So I purchased this one from Perfect Trading Inc, and it arrived in a seal pack condition. Though I had to waste half an hour to set up as it came in with all defaults set and that too in some Chinese language. Therefore I had to find my way through language settings and then restored it. Doing that allowed me to get to all the initial settings as it should prompt for when you turn it on for the first time. Along with this the charger that came with it was European plug. The nice thing about this was it came pre-installed with screen protector. Plus it also had Sony ear-phones in the box. Also to all who are curious; Yes it does HEAT a lot and drains battery heavily. In order to take care of the heating issue, Sony has disabled 2 cores of CPU in the OTA update, hence making it very similar to SnapDragon 805 and 801. But the heating issue is still there after the update as well.",Good
"I recently purchase this devise, so far it has been working well. Take very good pictures as well. The only draw back it doesn't use memory card and I do prefer to have my data stored on a memory card.",Good
it's a really nice phone. I cot a contract from Cricket and so far it has been working great.,Good
decent dual sim phone that gets the job done. The display is good but the the ZEN UI is not my cup of tea. Button layout are a bit to high up for me but it gets the job done as a backup phone. This does not work with Verizon or Sprint but works fine with ATT. I do recommend getting a case and tempered glass since the product feels cheap.,Good
"Thus far the case performs well enough. This new version with no protection for the home button leaves a bit to be desired as, unlike the previous version, there is now a hole in the screen protector. Rest assured, dust will get in under said screen protector via this avenue. I understand that this is to facilitate some new feature(s) but it remains a drawback for me.On the positive side, the outer element of the case seems made of stiffer, sturdier material than its predecessor. Perhaps this model will hold its shape and attractive appearance. For protection of ones iPhone, Otterbox cases serve with the best in the industry.",Good
"This is a great budget android phone especially if your just looking for something to temporarily replace a more mainstream android device like Samsung or Motorola. Overall it works without any problems and runs fairly smoothly. However, this phone won't be your go to device from streaming video or browsing the web, although it can do this. In all, for $50 you can't find a better option.",Good
"Este celular nokia c3 lo compre para regalarselo a mi hermana, la verdad hasta el dia de hoy ha salido muy bueno no ha tenido ningun proble de software o hardware lo traje para Ecuador, y me costo menos de la mita de lo que cuesta en mi PaÌ_s..",Good
"I bought this phone for my son as a tester to see how he would do with an ""expensive"" phone. It was cheap and worked just fine. It is obviously slower than the newer iPhones, but I wasn't ready to purchase one of those for my son just yet.",Good
"Hi, dear, I wrongly blamed the item I received and tried to return. Due to my carelessness, I thought it won't work. But in fact, it was because I didn't remove the yellow film on the battery. That's why it didn't work for me. I'm going to keep the item and don't return. I apologize for my wrongdoing and incorrect comments.",Good
This phone is really nice! I have a preference for HTC phones! It's size is perfect. My eyes are not as strong as they once were. I have no problem seeing the information on it's big and sharp screen! Great style! The only issue I have is it's headphone jack. My headphones don't plug in snugly to the port! They become disconnected fairly easily! I don't know if its just my phone or if it a design issue! Will continue to take advantage of the beats audio feature for as long as possible!,Good
This is a good smart phone. It's not blotted with a lot of apps. The phone comes with windows 7 and will update to windows phone 7.5 or 7.8 depending which carrier you go with. My phone is running 7.8 and it works flawless. Yes this phone came out 3 years ago but it is still a very good phone!,Good
"This cellphone is very good, it's just a little slow but it isn't a smartphone. It's samll and thin just like i was looking for.I buy it from HassleFreeCell and it was delivered very fast, unlocked and brand new.",Good
"i think it was new, but it tends to freeze up and i'm not sure if it was used before or not",Good
I bought this blue accessory phone cover to go along with the phone that i purchased and it worked out perfectly.,Good
Amazing phone. it works perfectly. Only thing to wish will be better is TVE battery.,Good
"It works as it is suppose to, except network drops sometimes for apparent reason.But price is right as well as quality.",Good
"From my daughter: hi, i bought this phone 4 about $125 and i think it is gr8!! the only thing is that when i got it, the manual was all in Hungarian and so was the phone language and i didn't know what 2 do:( so that is pretty much the only thing about it that i didn't like. the games are fun, the ringtones are cool, the camera is good, and i LOVE that u can insert ringtones and videos and pictures on 2 the texts!! u can buy a protective thingy 4 the touchscreen so it doesn't get all scratched up.( i used a hair clip 4 a stylus: BAD IDEA ) so i would say overall, this is a great phone and u should buy it!",Good
"I really like this phone. The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because the back is made from flimsy plastic. But that's not really an issue since I put on the plastic case.Otherwise, the phone is great.",Good
Overall great product. Met all expectations. Only problem was the charger that came with it didn't work.,Good
"I found that the phone runs pretty good after owning a Nokia 1630, and 635. One issue I have had us a red line going down the screen, I don't know if it is software or hardware issue. But I'm really liking the phone overall.",Good
"This is a great little phone. Weighs under 2 oz on my postal scale. One star off for the recessed charging port that others have mentioned (had to take a utility knife to the case). Going back to Kitkat is a bit weird, but everything works great. I got this as a second phone to take running without weighing me down. Switching sim cards takes a bit, but not too bad. Too small for me to use as an everyday phone. Would buy this brand again. All in all a great deal.",Good
"I've always love Otterbox cases, and this one is no different. The only problem is that the clear plastic screen protector bubbles up, so it's kind of annoying to text.",Good
"The product is exactly as described,good price and shipping. Excellent phone: 5 stars if there was warranty!",Good
Beautiful cell! I wait for it just 3 days! It was fantastic! The cell appeared very well treated. I recommend to you to get it.,Good
I chose this phone to replace the one that I have cause I like the slider.Nothing wrong with it and I would recommend it to anyone!!,Good
"I like this phone. You get good value for your money. It is not too fancy, but it works. I was positively surprised. Only downsides I can think of are that the camera is not great, and the earplugs not very comfortable (and u can use your own, but they function as antennae for the radio). But other than that, Im really happy with it. Im sure its nothing compared to the new iphone, but if you just want a nice phone with touchscreen to download nice android apps, and use wifi, and which works in both the US and Europe, for a good price; this is a good choice.",Good
"It arrived promptly .I love it but in Aussie ,it has limitations.I am just concerned that one has to go online to learn how to use the product as no manual was included.",Good
"I like this phone. It cable a week later, but it works well. It was classified as new, but if came with scratches on the back. Very few, though.",Good
"Llevo mas o menos unos 8 meses con el telefono tiene todo lo que se necesita, internet 3.5G, gps, touch... muy bien lo unico malo es que la bateria no dura mucho tiempo cuando se lo pone en modo de vibracion..",Good
"Works right, fixs perfectly...4/5 stars because the color is alot lighter then the picture shows. I ordered purple and white, and it looks more pink than purple.",Good
Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He has MetroPCS and at first had some trouble with the Internet connection. After talking on the phone with Metro his phone now works perfectly fine.P.S used in the U.S (New York),Good
"Went to Verizon Corp store, put the sim card in, turned it on and was up and running in minutes. Completed OS upgrade in 20 minutes, restored iCloud data and was good to go.",Good
Was like new condition. It just not meant to last forever. I am currently replacing it with a new phone.,Good
Great phone once flashed with Superzen to rid of the bloatware. But not so great build quality.,Good
"Placing this safety cover on the computer sure protects it however, know that it will add quite a bit of weight to the tablet.",Good
"Pros:* Great hardware - the best speakers on a phone, screen is excellent. I don't use the fingerprint reader or nfc chip but it has them* It has a great feel, the correct fit neither too big nor too small* Camera is highly customizable, possibly even more options than an old dSLR (though no optical zoom obviously)* Awesome price, 3GB RAM, SIM+microSD slot, reception is better than my old Nexus 5* Battery does not run hot, I haven't even felt it warm yetCons:* The custom UI is pretty, but a big drain on resources. The phone feels sluggish at times",Good
"My only complaint is the reception seems like it might not be all that good, a little to early to tell though. Outside of that there is no volume control on the ear speaker. Phone is rough and heavy and is pretty much exactly what I thought it should be. It does not feel like a cheap item, I've only had it for a few days so time will tell.",Good
"Absolutely love my new Iphone. Has been working exactly like it should, and the phone came in better condition that i thought it would. It was like new. The charger on the other hand, is what made me give it a 4 star rating. It was packaged like new but it works extremely slowly. It does charge, but just too slowly. I compared with my roommates charger and hers worked a lot faster. Other then my charger complaint, the phone is awesome. I highly recommend. It also came faster then expected. It even came with a free phone screen and back cover.",Good
Works great for what i need it for a little more internal memory and i would have given 5stars thanks,Good
I love this phone it arrived on time like new and came with Samsung charger. It's a Verizon phone but I use ATT prepaid on gsm. Just found out the flash doesn'the work so may be returning.,Good
Cheap basic android phone bought it as a gift for someone who was not savvy in android phones and she has managed to operate it fairly well. It's definitely worth the price,Good
"i just bought this for my friend, it's a good phone with android apps.. but the shape is lil bit old fashioned...",Good
"Its fine. I wanted something right away that will work in Jamaica and this is a good phone for that. It comes with its own, case, earphone and screen protector",Good
"Have been wanting to jump back into a Blackberry after leaving for an Iphone a few years back.Considered the Passport, but the size was just a tad tolarge for me. However, the classic is just right in 99% of what I was wanting to get out of a Blackberry (OS is smooth, keyboard is PERFECT, screen is crisp and clear).The only reason I give the Classic a 4.5 and not a 5 is for the App defeciency although with Snap it can be resolved.Overall very pleased and highly reccomend to anyone wanting to jump back!",Good
"This product is good, durable and seems to be exactly like described.My dad is using this phone and he is really happy with this.",Good
"The Galxy j5 t's not the fastest handset around, as its quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and 1.5GB of RAM put its day-to-day performance on par with almost every other budget smartphone. In Geekbench 3, the J5 scored 459 in the single core test and 1,343 in the multicore test, putting it just behind the Moto G on our budget leaderboard. That said, Samsung's Android 5.1.1-based TouchWiz interface still feels relatively smooth and responsive, and apps don't take an age to open either. The Moto G proved quicker at loading games, but web browsing was more or less a level playing field, as evidenced by the J5's Peacekeeper score of 634, which is only around 100 points short of the Moto G. Scrolling was a little jerky in places, and browsing could be rather stop-start when pages were still loading, but otherwise surfing the web was pretty hassle free.",Good
"I am giving 4 stars for this product because of an issue I am having with the camera. When I use 4k o another feature it gets really hot and the camera app crashes and you need to restart the phone inserting a little piece of metal near the SIM card space.But, overall, it is a great phone, everything else works perfectly and it's much much better than my old Samsung Galaxy S3.",Good
"Great phone for the money, they work great never have any problems and way cheaper than buying many other brands that aren't any better than this phone. Great company.",Good
"Great stuff ,solid built for such a small amount of money.Studio C , 8 mp camera with 3,000 mAh battery adds a nice amount of weight to it. The buttons are all solid and clicky, and the seams around the removable back are super flush and tight and even removable.Touch surface needs to be improved,it's not as smooth as you'd expect from a higher-end phone.From software viewpoint, this is basically stock Lollipop.The 1GB of RAM is also a noticeable point. It has a massive batteryThis device is worth a buy in $100 price range.",Good
Excelente.. me encanta!! muy Ì¼til.. justo lo que necesitaba :D lo recomendarÌ© a mis amigos para que lo compren. .,Good
If you like Windows Phone you'll like it fine. Great so far no issues and does what it's supposed to. Only gives H+ in USA. Read about it first.,Good
Well overall its a great phone for the price and what it comes equipped with. I wish it was more cases I could chose from besides just the one I received with the phone also I'm lost on how I don't have the Smiley's in my text keyboard. The camera and recording is great. PLUS I wish there was an quicker way to get help from the company because I'm still waiting on a response to my questions. But besides those minor things I love this phone.,Good
"The phone is more than enough of what I need in a phone. The only downside is that, because it's used, it came with a damaged audio imput and I have to adjust my earphone jack once in a while to get sound.",Good
"I like the phone so far. Just an FYI, the phone that was shipped is marked Verizon so it is likely not ""Factory Unlocked"". While the phone appears to be new, the box was resealed, so it is possible that it is a return or refurbished item. I am happy and for the price no complaints, but just surprised.",Good
"The phone did not come in an original tmobile box, but new. I initially had trouble setting up the password on the phone and went to tmobile to get it reset. Other than that, the phone worked like it should.",Good
"Both the American plug and the European socket provide a good electrical connection. The one I received was black, not white.",Good
"the phone is not unlocked as and I was told to pay extra money to unlock more in my town.it's a good phone and it works great, but reality should talk about unlocking.",Good
"Great phone for the price. Sadly the international version has no American plug, but an European one.",Good
Color was darker than it looked online. Looks almost black. Otherwise the case was exactly as shown online. Nice and new.,Good
"This is a great phone for the price. Only complaint is the battery life. If Motorola ever puts a longer lasting battery in one of these, it would be a perfect phone.",Good
"The phone came exactly as advertised! Its a dumb phone, so its hard to say ""I love it"", but it is exactly what I ordered. The shipping time was very slow however.",Good
I personally think it's too big and bulky but I guess it's getting the job done. My husband swears by it and love it.,Good
"First off, be sure you receive a D620R and not a D620K which drops the 800MHz LTE band needed for Europe. Go to Settings/About Phone/Hardware to verify the model.Pros:1. Small physical size for a 4.7"" display.2. Bright Display - you can see the pixels but they are small.3. The included File Manager can read/write to the external_SD card.4. Accepts 64GB microSD cards - just tap the error notification and the phone will reformat it to FAT32.5. Operation is snappy and it plays all the videos I tried smoothly.Cons:1. No light sensor so only manual brightness control.2. Small 8GB internal storage leaving only 3GB for you.Overall, I am pleased with this LG G2 mini phone.",Good
I bought two phones from this seller one for me and 1 from my wife and she made out better than me. My phone is practically un used but.......it came with a generic battery. Also my power button it a little hard to press(i few trys are needed). other than that it's good. She has no problems as far as she knows it's brand new ;) but let's keep that between me n you,Good
Overall features are quite useful but reboots randomly.It is unlocked and works with att sim.It comes with T-Mobile sim which is already inserted.,Good
Love the phone. Great quality. Only problem is that the external camera button it too easy to trip. Needs to be in a different place.,Good
"I received this phone a few weeks ago, service was great from Amazon.The phone is just what I spected, still learing how to use, it has a lot of different specs.I work out visiting clients, it keep me well informed with my e-mails and messages.Recomend it to anybody !!! great phone...",Good
"A bit deceiving that the box claims it's a Dual LTE phone - it's not. SIM 1 supports LTE, but SIM 2 slot is limited to 2G only. So it's dual-sim but not dual LTE. Other than that, it's really awesome!",Good
"Bought this for my son. It is his second one. To say it took a lickin and kept on tickin would be an understatement. Until he finally smashed the screen out of it, it was battered and bruised but would still make a call. Nice screen size too. I have a Droid X. It's too big to carry easily. Great for nav screen,not so much for phone. This seems to be a better all around phone. Bit out of date now though.",Good
Great product for the price. Easy set up. Just needed a sim card adapter to keep the micro sim in place. Great service and shipping!,Good
product excellent both 2 package send when you just could send my 1 box with both cell phones is what i dont like,Good
"It was a little more broken in than I thought, but in good working order.I will kill this phone so a used one in best for me.",Good
"Great phone. I upgraded from a Nexus 5 and it was not huge and profound increase in speed but just a nice good solid upgrade. The phone is lighter, has a better battery and the screen is an improvement. The only downside is that I wish the CPU processor had less cores but a higher CPU speed. The camera (Stills and video), WiFi and voice quality is very good.If you are on GSM and not a hardcore phone gadget person, I would recommend this phone. It is a really good phone for the price.",Good
Didn't think I'd fall in love with this phone only because this is my emergency cellphone but I've had a few months with it very well and I'll be honest the cons doesn't out weigh the pros with this phone it's still an affordable option,Good
"we can not figure out how to program the ringtones for contacts.. other than that my grand daughter loves the phone , I purchased the phone for her and she is happy except with this ring tone thing.",Good
This is a great phone. It is 3G and really fast. i have bought several of these phones for Christmas presents...i highly recommend hthis phone...If u are with Straight Talk,Good
Came a little scratched and worn but the seller told me about this before purchase. The phone works without any problems. I wish I hadn't bought it because the ecosystem is dead but the phone itself still works.,Good
"the phone is great, but its a transition from keyboard to touch screen, your next phone now could we andriod, iphone etcyou will leave to be a bb userno more bb button, and apps are oriented to use with touch screen, than buttonsis very fast, more powerfull to multimedia, and have skype!for 250usd its a great phone, but is no more the clasicc bb",Good
its a great phone. the enough memory for my favs apps. The camera isnt perfect but the front is.I LOVE IT,Good
"I bought it for my cousin and he is happy with it. It has all the features he was looking for, so far no complaint.",Good
"Excellent product! Brand new in box as stated. Works perfectly! Would have rated 5 stars had it been unlocked. But it wasnt a big deal as the phone being replaced used the same sim and was already using straight talk through AT&T towers. This phone was a gift and was very well received! I would love one for myself to upgrade from my S3. The S4 is much faster, especially after disabling all the bloatware that comes installed!",Good
"I ordered this phone from Amazon and initially liked everything about this phone (looks, build quality, features, etc.). The main problem I had with this phone was the small fonts. Even at the large font setting, the words were hard to see. I do not wear glasses but have difficulty reading smaller print than normal. This is just a heads up to anybody who may have a problem with small fonts.If you are a person who has no problem with small fonts, then this phone is an excellent choice. I need not say more as the positives have been covered by the many reviews on Amazon as well as outside sources. It was too bad I had a problem with the small fonts, otherwise I would have definitely kept this phone.",Good
very lightweight...a dramatic difference from my palm pixi! It took some getting use to not having a touch screen but I like it.,Good
"The Asus Zenfone is a great phone in general. Many consider it a budget phone because of its price, but it runs as great as newly released Androids and has larger capacity and a faster processor than a IPhone. Plus its pretty dang big. The pictures are nice too. The only con is that it slows down when your battery is low I'm talking less than 5%. Other than that its a really good phone. (Yes, you can face swap with Snapchat)",Good
"If you are looking at this phone, budget is obviously important for you. But value for money is where this phone scores. If you looking for a regular cheap phone for just calling and texting and which has a good battery life, then this phone is for you. And it comes with Nokia reliability. However don't expect the phone to have cool internet browsing features or apps or else you will be disappointed. I feel its a lot to ask from $49.",Good
"Excellent phone. Arrived as advertised. A bit pricey for ""just a phone"" - but some people don't do well with Smartphones, and this is a genuine Nokia, solid as a tank and very familiar interface.",Good
"i like a phone that calls people, with no need for interent or texting or anything else really, this phone is great.i always have more bars than my girlfriends iphone :)",Good
nice case but dont fit as well as the original blacks ones do its not as tight,Good
Good quality phone. Great reception and android performance. We're using with t-mobile and it seems to work well - even seems to work with t-mobile's wifi calling and messaging,Good
The only thing I don't like is it freezes up n I have to restart it but other than that I love it,Good
"So far so good. Item is working as it should currently. But I've only had it a couple days, but the delivery time was outstanding.",Good
"This tablet is a steal for the price. I bought it for use at home as a house tablet. It will stay in the living room for anyone to use.Very fast, responsive screen. Color depth could be deeper, but the screen has a thin viewing angle so the colors wash out as it's tilted. Not deep like more expensive tablets/iPads.I plan to but several more for use as gifts.",Good
"Faster than L5nice screen size, Battery doesn't long too much.Android 4 OS Works Fast but slow down with some Apps like Skype.Very nice Phone!You want a Good and unexpensive smartphone, this is the one!!",Good
My daughter likes this phone very much so far. It's the one she wanted and she is happy with it.,Good
"Wanted to give 5 stars but had a small problem getting started on Tmobile. Yes, it is unlocked, but not exactly a ""pop in any sim and go"" phone. After 15-20 mins on the line with tmobile techs to get it set up, when all was said and done, it's a good little phone. I bought it as a spare for when my kids are having their phones repaired. Texting is difficult when you have meathooks for hands but my son actually got used to it quickly. I'm thinking about getting another for my mother-in-law because the virtual key pad on the screen is bigger than the one on her phone and alot easier to see. All in all, a good little phone for someone looking for a basic texting phone.",Good
"I had a Samsung Exhibit II phone that was not very satisfactory. When it died I was not going to buy another Samsung phone but among phone for T Mobile, this phone had the best features for the price. If you don't need one of the premium models and don't want to pay for one, this is a good choice. It's much better and faster (Android 4.1) than my old phone. Battery life is good enough to make it through my day. I don't ask a lot of a phone but I want it to be working when I need it. This phone is small and compact enough to fit in my pocket. It has a non slip back that helps keep it from falling out.",Good
"Pros: Good Price, Decent amount of RAMS, a good camera, nice display, Has Hotknot, does everything that a phone should do.Cons: No good cases available, (except for the case that comes with it in the box) Not a very durable screen, (I accidentally dropped the first one I had, and it fell 3 feet from the ground.) Doesn't work with MetroPCS for some reason, and, if dropped, the cellular signal in the phone might act up.Basically, It's very a fragile phone, so be careful.",Good
"got it after my samsung galaxy was stolen. it looks like a graphing calculator. it's really cute tho. i'm not use to having a phone that requires a sd card to use the camera. i don't really know how to add contacts straight from a text message, so i'm adding on contacts manually. i hate how when you look at your call logs and look at a name it automatically calls them. the manual it comes with is probably in the world's smallest print. i have a t mobile data plan and i'm not able to access the internet...for the time being. overall if you just want a simple phone that connects you closer to facebook well here you go",Good
"THE SELLER WAS VERY NICE, I LOVE ALL THE COLOURFUL FACE, THE CAMERA TAKES GOOD PICTURES AND WINDOWS 8 WAS FAST, THE ONLY PROBLEM I ENCOUTER WAS I COULDN'T TRANSFER MY PICTURES TO MY LAP TOP. SO I RETURNED IT, THE SELLER WAS NICE TO REFUND MY MONEY",Good
"I really don't need a smartphone, just a basic cell phone for occasional use. My old Nokia 6030 was on its last legs, so I got this, put in my t-mobile SIM card and was up & running.The music player, radio and Bluetooth connectivity are nice to have. A micro USB cable is necessary for backing up the phone or copying music via PC, but easily available on Amazon (kindle cable should work).I disabled text messages on my plan, so no comment on that.",Good
Es un celular de gran calidad a muy buen precio.. tiene todo lo basico y necesario para el dia adia.. lo unico es q no levanta 3G y no posee controles de volumen a los lados q son muy necsarios para mi..,Good
"This phone was a complete waste of hardware and money it pretty much has no settings,when you have it on silent there are absolutely no alert signal so you have to constantly wake it up to check for messages or emails however the light will blink for a missed call, pretty much nothing in the market place, I could go on but I won't don't buy this phone unless it's priced at $40 and you are desperate for a temperary phone",Good
"I wanted a phone for mainly talking, and capability to text as well. This one does that perfectly at a great price unlocked.",Good
I'm loving this phone! Both back and front cameras are amazing. I am happy that the front camera has flash; picture quality is crisp and clear. My only worry now is to find a case to fit this phone. It comes with a 'case' which is pretty much useless as the phone keeps sliding off the adhesive on the phony case.,Good
"Love this phone.For some reason, it took a few weeks for me to receive the phone but once it was delivered I have had no complaints.",Good
Speaking about the looks its great.... ill give it five stars for the price aswell. I bought it during black friday and its been working great eversince. The only drawback on it would be that there is no way to recieve any sort of notification when u get a text msg. Nada u got to be checking over and over just to make sure.Keeping in mind that I only use it for text and calls works like a charm.The alarm sure will wake u up!,Good
"Great phone, but sometimes I get reports of people calling me and not through. Occasionally my phone will simply ring once and then I get a missed call. Other than that, great phone!",Good
Works well for a teen that does not need to have internet access on their phone.So far no technical issues.,Good
A beat up used phone that works for $12. Just what I needed. I get it when they said I would and it works.This was to replace my father-in-law's phone he left on the bus. He has Alzheimer and it would be difficult for him to learn how to use a new phone. It is bad enough getting him to talk into the right end.,Good
"Be carefull when you buy this one.The description means SQN100-3, but I got SQN100-2 verizon model.so you need to check before you buy.I bought another Q10 SQN100-3 from other seller. and it works fine and keypad is awesome.",Good
Very nice; just make sure to clear all background apps to prevent overheating while it's charging.,Good
It's awesome!!!Except the speakers are of less good quality than I expected. Not loud enough for listeining to music or audiobooks and bad for listening to calls on speaker!,Good
"Great phone, performs well, has nice screen. Battery runs down a little quick, but it usually gets me through the day.",Good
Great phone for the money paid. Can't complain . The Storm phone is a great choice for people who enjoy pinging.,Good
"The battery life is crap. Otherwise its a great phone. Its a good size for reading my kindle, lots of storage, and lots of cool features.",Good
Traveled to the Caribbean with this phone it worked great.Great buy and quality no issues .Highly recommend.,Good
"Possibly the best Android platform out there along with Z3+. Stellar standby time. Very attractive styling, almost iPhone-esque in attention to detail. Snappy processor.There's only one problem with this phone: If you break the glass you're SOL as replacement parts come from China, take forever and don't work half the time. If you break this phone, prepare to replace it.",Good
"I have T-Mobile and it works fantastically. I bought it because I needed a bigger screen (had the Moto G, another great phone) but the screen was too small. Great phone all around.",Good
I ordered this phone for my mom and she really enjoys it. She especially loves the news feed on the home screen.,Good
"The phone is great and my wife has been using it for several months. However, I have been chatting or on the phone with Total Wireless (TotalWireless) 3 times in the past 24 hours because the phone was unable to make or receive calls. Texting and data continued to work.After the 3rd call, the TW help said the phone is not compatible. They only support verizon phones (verizon carrier locked) or phones from TW.I am going to switch to Straightalk (ATT?) and see how that works.",Good
"Nice phone for people that dont ""work"" on it just text phone apps is just fine",Good
This was worth every penny. Only weird thing is now my phone will every so often say that this cable or accessory is not for iPhone. Other than that... It's fantastic!,Good
Good phone... Battery in good shape (lasts about 20 hours between charges)... Works as expected. No complaints,Good
I love my new iphone-4! It has lots of cool applications that help me keep organized in my everyday life.My first experience shopping on Amazon has been great. My phone was shipped in the matter of a few days and arrived here a couple day earlier than I expected!I am happy with my overall service from my new phone and also Amazon and would recommend amazon to buy off of!,Good
Still functining looks good. I just this three phone and both are working fine no problem. thank you see you,Good
The best thing about this phone is that it didn't come with a thousand Apps that I couldn't remove although it did come with some. At least I am now able to install ALL the apps I need and want. One disappointment was that this version of Android isn't compatible with the Chrome Browser :(The camera actually takes awesome pictures plus it has a FLASH and it ZOOMS!!!It didn't come with a cable to synch media with my computer which was disappointing also but I was able to buy one at Walmart.Phone call quality is good. I noticed that with the No Contract there are places that I no longer get reception that I did when I had I Contract but that is Verizon's fault.,Good
"I bought the note 4 few months ago. It is very good looking phone and it has tons of features (like all samsung and android phones). But honestly, other than the faster processor, and the pen, it is not much different than my old s4. The screen was a bit big for my taste. I noticed that you will need to use ur both hands to do most of the phone functions. Whereas with my s4 (or any 5 inch screen phone) you can use one hand for most of the tasks. If large screens aren't your preference, i say get a smaller phone. This phone a bit big, and it even large to put in my pocket. The Pros however is that it is the last large screen phone from Samsung that it will have a removable battery, and a micro SD card. So if this what you want (in addition to the large screen) then go ahead a buy this right away.",Good
"Es un celular de gama baja que hace su trabajo dando ademÌÁs algunas caracterÌ_sticas propias de los smartphones. Se recomienda para personas que quieran un celular para hacer o recibir llamadas pero que tambiÌ©n quieran algo de comunicaciÌ_n a travÌ©s de otros medios como el WhatsApp, Twitter o Facebook.It's a low-end cell does its job well giving some characteristics of smartphones. Recommended for people who want a phone to make or receive calls but also want some communication through other media such as WhatsApp, Twitter or Facebook.",Good
"It's a great budget phone. It's decently fast and responds most of the time. Has an okay camera, for close shots with clarity. Nice front flash. I've been using in for about 4 months. Though you can find the touch to be a bit inaccurate. Not really a Good device for drawing. Also the gyroscope is off by a bit. And what really bothers me is the 8gb of storage. It's just not enough space. Overall this is a great budget phone .",Good
"FYI- This is a 2 G phone. When attivated with AT&T, I was alerted that as of Dec 2016, 2G phones will no longer work on their network. I still think we'll get our money's worth in that time frame- seems to be a great phone, but that was an unwelcome surprise.",Good
"Slimmer than S3, lacks the FM radio, has some good improvements over the S3.The keyboard has the numeric row on top so you don't have to switch between ABC and 123Battery duration seems to be a little bit better.",Good
"Everything works perfectly, very good buy. THE WORKS PERFECTLY TLF. All buttons are GOOD AND PERFORMANCE WAS GOOD. THANK YOU",Good
"bello el modelo liviano super elegante, el unico detalle es que la pila dura solo 24 horas por lo demas excelente",Good
"i got for my husband who doesnt like fancy phones ,he likes to regular bell ring tones and the style of phone",Good
"Little slow. I think due to its 512mb ram.after it, everything ok. It is a good phone",Good
"In general, I like the phone, and have ordered previous Motorola Barrage V860's from Amazon.com, but this particular phone that was sent to me, does have several annoying things about it, and I don't know how to resolve them:1) It is much harder to open the back of the phone, than it was for any of my previous phones (had to use a coin in all Barrage's, but this particular one is really hard to get the back off the phone).2) The battery is in the back of the phone, so tightly, that it's a struggle to remove it, just to replace it in the back, to ""reboot"" the phone.3) The listening volume is lower than my previous Barrage's, and I'm slighly hard of hearing, so I have to use either the speaker mode, or I have to use a headset.Anyone have advice about these issues? Please let me know!If anyone has advice, please let me know! My cell is 970-531-5000, and my email is fsds@rkymtnhi.com.",Good
"I am not going to get into the software and functionality of the Phone. There are better places to do that research (Cnet.com, Android Authority ect)... The phone was brand new in the box with all required accessories and packed well and arrived quickly. However the description does not mention the color you will receive and the picture shows a Grey / Black phone. What I received was labeled as pink, although it is more of a reddish. Not that bed, had it been pink we would have had a problem!",Good
I had an great experience with dealers who sold this item. They were willing to work with me when a problem occurred with the item I appreciated that dearly.,Good
It is good I give it a 4 due because it isn't really any different than the regular razr it even has the same phone ID,Good
Eeasy powerful smart! It works fine offering many functions that make it precious in several circumstances. Buy it and you'll be satisfied!,Good
"This product came just like it said it was. I am very pleased with everything. The phone works great and everything was cleaned off of it, so all I had to do was turn it was. It was an awesome buy!",Good
I now have bought one for each of my 18+ year old kids. They are thrilled to have all of the necessary smart phone features without the broken screens from dropping.,Good
"Phone doesn't feel quite finished. It's missing some key features, like a functional launcher. Updates have helped a bit. The phone can't use it's powerful processor as it overheats immediately 45-60å¡ C when doing anything remotely cpu intensive (every game). Battery life on standby is good, if you have a lot of apps going in the background it'll last 8 hours, assuming you don't turn the screen on. Screen on time using heavily, it'll last 3 hours, maybe.Metal back and super hot always makes my hands sweat.",Good
"Got this for my wife as she has no need of a data plan but would like basic smartphone capabilities when WIFI is available. Of course it's no iphone but at this price I must say I'm impressed. The touchscreen is very responsive and for basic apps, email and web browsing I'm not encountering any waiting. Of course you'll want a Micro-SD if you plan on taking pictures or video, or downloading a lot, but at <$30 for 64 gb I don't see that as a minus. Also, she likes the blue color.",Good
"This phone has worked out great for someone who uses a cell phone as a phone and doesn't need all the extra bells and whistles. Does it have some extra features? Yes, text, GPS, and simple net access...and that's just enough. Very pleased with this phone.",Good
"Very impressive phone. No written manual provided. However, a ""BLU Help"" app. is on the phone, and their customer service is excellent.",Good
"I bought the phone for my boyfriend he likes it. The bad thing about it though is that the battery life isn't the best, but thank you :)",Good
"It's better than a starter phone and you can't beat the price anywhere. I've had it for nearly a year and it has worked very well for me. GPS and WiFi work great. Speaker volume is a little low when using speaker phone and GPS. Camera is OK for the price. Only about 2G of space for applications and no good way to put apps on the SD card. I don't use many large apps anyway, but with apps getting bigger, I'll probably need to upgrade in a few years.",Good
"I bought this cute little cell phone to replace my wife's clunky old, poor performing Nokia. This phone does all that it needs to do for a great price, and does it well.I'd have rated it 5 stars if not for the poor camera function of the phone. Still, it is a basic, cute little model.R",Good
It's a great phone glad I brought it. Very user friendly (for those who are familiar with the galaxy brand). The only and I do me only problem is no expandable memory. Though that was my fault for not investigating further. That aside it is a awesome phone!!,Good
The phone is fine - I'm just bummed that I lost my other phone and had to pay $280 to replace it - but that was 'my bad'.,Good
"Has trouble switching between Wi-Fi and 4G on it's own. Easily fixed by putting it in airplane mode for a few seconds. Otherwise it's great, no complaints.",Good
"PROS:* Really great value (price vs hardware)* Really thin and lightweight* Nice size screen 4.7"" and hd resolution: 1280 x 720* Gorilla glass!!!!* Dual sim* Includes screen protector and rubber case* Good camera quality, the front one for selfies is 5MP!* Loud speaker* Size is perfect for one hand use for most people.* great first sim antenna/signal* 4GB internal and micro sd card slotSO-SO:* only 1GB of RAM.* not that great second sim antenna/signal (but this is usual in many dual-sim phones)* Not that good battery life, but it will last 8 to 10 hours of casual use.* not user replaceable battery, we will find out it the battery is a problem or not later.CONS:* No KitKat update at the moment* sporadic hangs* no lte / 4gOTHERS:* included headphones we're really good looking and with good sound, but it seems the built quality is not, after 1 week one of the earbuds stop working.* I bought it just some days after Life Play 8 was released on Amazon! Oh man!!!! Octacore 1.7ghz vs Quadcore 1.3ghz!",Good
"Not bad. Camera quality is not as good as I expected, though. The image is kind of soft.",Good
"Great battery life, but the raised keys keep turning the phone on when pressed inside a purse, for example. Even if you lock it and turn off the key sounds, it still keeps turning the phone on. Also, pretty hard to insert SIM cards, perhaps even harder to remove.Update: +1 star, tested in EU, works like a champ.",Good
i love the desing and the theme but i felt like it's too slow or maybe it's my mind but i love itanother think i dont even know which gorilla glass have this phone...,Good
The item is a good product. The problem was the service by The Oem Shop and amazon because send to me a phone wasn't unlock. I explained that return back the item was not be convenient for me because I paid taxes and sending cost that yours companies don't refund to me. I tried to find another solution. I expected to receive the unlock code but it wasn't. I had to buy a unlock service for this item. It costs to me $20.,Good
"Item arrived on time and in excellent condition, just as described. Had a partial charge and was ready to use. Came in a Samsung box, and had the manual and Samsung battery also included. Very happy with my purchase of the phone (and I love that its blue :) ) and with the seller (Battery Assault).",Good
Great features. Waterproof!!! Great charger. Long lasting battery. I have one and so does my husband.love love love!,Good
"It protects my phone, which is what I bought it for; but, I though it would be more flexible than what it is. I also cannot use my fingerprint touch to unlock my phone because the button is covered. Otherwise, for the money, I like it.",Good
"Best BB Ever.Nice interface, nice design, nice accesories.Do not include micro SD (Not that nice).Hope RIM change their mind and allow this product to upgrade to BBX OS.",Good
"Very good phone for the money. Screen is bright and easy to read, sound quality is good and the performance is fast enough for the apps I use. I am not a power phone user. To find a reasonably priced phone that did what I needed and did it well was appreciated",Good
Very nice phone. It is a simple phone but it work good. Maybe the camera not perfect but for the price it is a worthy phone.I am from the caribbean and the phone work ok. It is indeed unlocked.,Good
"I have had this phone for about 4 months. I was all set to get a Note 5 until I researched the price. I recently lost my phone and just purchased a replacement of the same. Gotten the most compliments about this phone. I use mine on a Net 10 network. I love the size, speed of the apps, and the price. Easy set up. However, there are two drawbacks for me. Since I love to take pictures, I found it disappointing that there was not a zoom feature on the rear camera. Secondly, the sound/speaker is good but not as loud as my S5. I love playing my music on speaker when working out. Very pleased overall and have recommended this brand to everyone I meet. This is noteworthy, since I am a Samsung lover!",Good
"Phone is great. Better than expected. Apps run great. Camera shutter is a little slow and the gallery view is jumbled, this is the reason for only 4 stars.",Good
"I needed a phone immediately so waiting for the S6 was not possibleI like this phoneI had heart failure when I read on the end of the box ""European SIM only""Amazon assured me no problemI have now used SIM cards from Philippines and Thailand with no problemsgoing to try 4G next week in ThailandI understand that this phone will not work with a lot of carriers in the US due to (I suspect) their monopoly mentality,,,surprised their rule are not illegal in the US as they seem to dictate to their customers and manufacturers with locks etcI will be in Central America in 2 months and expect no problems there either,,,except maybe from CLARO",Good
I just see sometimes a little problem in the screen !! Like a little points !!,Good
Great starting phone. Decent camera provided on a low end phone. Works fine and meets expectations.,Good
"I worried a NOS (New Old Stock) cellphone would have a weak battery but this has been working fine. I had no problems with setting it up. It was unlocked and no problem getting a SIM card and activating with my carrier. I do not have a lot of apps, pictures, or music on my phone, but I do sometimes get a memory warning so I will delete duplicate photos and unused apps. Next time I will get 16 GB, but I doubt I will ever need 32. Shame on Apple for saying they will stop supporting older phones. That is just a statement that their new $ 800 phone is only of value for a very few years. Planned obsolescence is what destroyed Detroit. I might go Android next time. I only got the iphone because my wife wanted to facetime, but I seldom have a strong enough signal for facetime to work.",Good
"I've had this phone for almost a year now, and it works well. The screen is bright and the resolution is good enough to not be annoying. I'm not one of those people that needs the highest rez on a six inch screen. The three beefs I have with this phone are, the upper and lower bezels are huge! Why do they have to be that big? And the lower bezel is totally unused. Why didn't they put the soft keys there instead of (second issue) taking up a half inch of the bottom of the screen with them? And finally, the speaker sucks. I realize the phone is thin and "" affordable"", but its huge, so why not put in a bigger/more powerful speaker? OK, those are my complaints. I will, however, say again that the function and usability if the phone is great. Its the physical things that are off putting.",Good
"I am proud of this phone for the money. It didn't work at first, as it wouldn't complete setup. After a call to Verizon, they discovered that the memory hadn't been completely wipes. After a hard reset it worked perfectly.",Good
This was a gift to my nephew and he wanted to have Sony Xperia Z and one of the reason is this is water resistant,Good
"Bought this phone in August 2014, December 2014 the charge port quit working and by March 2015 the microphones failed as well. I like the look of the phone and the software is great for the price. The main thing is read the fine print if you plan on buying the phone and having it repaired by BLU warranty service. You have to send your phone to them in Miami and wait forever to hear anything back from their customer service. They claim repairs only take 10-15 days, but it has been over a month since I sent my phone to them and still have not got it back....My point is whether you buy this device or any BLU device be prepared for poor customer service when it has issues.",Good
Good basic touch phone without lots of bells and whistles. The camera feature does not zoom which makes it somewhat limited. It would be nice if the keyboard was bigger.,Good
"Phone is overall awsome. A friend adjusted the settings so I have no issues with brightness because it auto adjusts to whatever setting I'm in. The battery life could be a problem to the on the go user but for a office worker like me its a charge in the morning and a charge sometime during work (but omly on days when I use the phone a lot - Snapchat is battery suicide). The overheating is my only concern. It doesnt bother me now but I wonder what damage it will cause in the future. Overall, its the most awesome phone I've owned and as a hobbyist photographer the camera quality is the best thing ever. Plus, it does all the other things phones are supposed to do.",Good
"Very good condition and the one I got from my second seller worked fine with original Colorado wireless provider ROM but the seller was nice enough to locate an LG D801 T-Mobile variant image download so converted it to T-Mobile variant and got the Android 5.0.2 Lollipop update, which is starting to become a base level Android version for some software now, the 4.2 Android version it originally had was getting pretty old.This is still a very good phone, an excellent used value even in 2016 and probably well into 2017 or even 2018 as it has more than adequate hardware for most tasks.",Good
"Great phone!!! This is my first phone lol and I love it. It's fast, smooth and easy to use. Only problem is that the battery drains kind of fast. But other than that I love this phone!",Good
"Have had posh microx for a day now. It is not going to replace your full size android phone. No app drawer, cannot uninstall some apps. No weather widget available except native, closest city 50miles away. That being said, amazing for the 30$ I paid. I have lots of smartphones. Doesn't compare with my note or fire phone. Would say it is about as good as my Alcatel c1. Other than the pros or cons of being super small. I would say its a solid low end android phone.",Good
"A very decent phone, very comfortable, good quality, buy it as a gift for my mother and is very easy to use, although I had no problems with any application but the battery does not last late afternoon",Good
"This is a great cellphone, loaded with all sorts of features, features I will never use; it is nice to have just in case and to play a bit. Excellent product.",Good
"Excellent phone, very fast and clear screen.Sadly, dont work with Movilnet in VenezuelaThe wall charger fails the second time i use and its not charging anymore. So, i charge via usb pc port.",Good
"I love this phone, its a galaxy tab on a budget. It took a while to transition from a Blackberry but so far so good. The camera quality is great and so is the overall resolution",Good
"De entrada es magestuosa su presentaciÌ_n. Totalemtne tactil, amigable y poderoso. Existe la posibilidad de agregarle mas capacidad de memoria a travÌ©s de la ranura de expansion, yo ya encargue una de 16gb, ya que de paquete trae una de 8gb. 95% recomendable, el resto 5% no lo recomendarÌ_a por ser algo complicado con el sistema de posicionamiento de GPS, a una semana de haber activado la cuenta de un mes gratis, no me he podido conectar con ningun satelite, no de modo general ni de modo asistido. Y justamente esta herramienta del GPS fue lo que me llamo la atencion al momento de hacer la compra por lo cual me siento un poco frustado. Espero conseguir la solucion al problema lo mÌÁs pronto posible. En lo multimedia perfecto, en sonido externo fenomenal, es altamente recomendado, los videos corren de maravilla. Graba video, y toma fotos como un profesional. En resumen, si se solventa lo del GPS y el satelite, serÌ_a el mejor telefono del momento.",Good
I was pleased with the iPhone 4S. I will do business with the company when I upgrade.,Good
Except for the keypad being a tad hard to recognize key presses this phone is great for what it does.After punching in the right info it does multimedia messaging with T-mobile.All in all a great phone so far.,Good
its all great i swear works just like a new i phone 4s but the top power button does not work unless i hold it down for about three times which hurts.,Good
It's a real pretty phone I just don't think you can use this phone with T-mobile,Good
"This phone is just awesome! Hip, Stylish, with lots of options.My friends are just so jealous! I only wish I could read on it, like Kindle books...",Good
"Buy a nokia e72, November 30 and received on 05 January, has so far worked well, however, came the phone without key on / off.",Good
"Nice little phone. I am not giving it a 5 star because of the small memory size, both RAM 256 but it works well as a basic phone which is what it is intended for - texting and phone calls.

I like it because is an excellent phone is fast and it has a lot of funtion that make my life easy to work,Good
"cameral too slow. no backspace. not sensitive enough, do not allowed you use your own language. for example, I want to use dats right, it would not allow me move forward with my typing until i change dats to that. It control's my typing which is not good",Good
"Everything came in better shape than I thought it would. No scratches or dents in the phone; it was as good as brand new. The only problem is that now it occasionally says my sim card cant be detected and forces me to restart my phone which I've never had that problem with my sim card before. It came with certain AT&T apps installed on the phone but it wasn't a problem disabling the apps through the settings. All in all, it was a good purchase, and three months later I still have no problems.",Good
"Deliver was slow; however, there was more than was advertised. Item was sold as use but I could see no signs of use. Within my limited ablilities the phone works fine.",Good
The phone works great. I have no problems with the refurbished phone. As soon as it was programed to my carrier it worked perfectly. Shipping was little slow but other wise this transaction went smooth.,Good
"Beautiful phone blu studio c 5 + 5. Bought as a transition phone for my 11 year old. She cracked the screen on her other phone, i wanted to replace with something less expensive. We've had it a week. Great look, awesome colors. Seems to work well....now....2 things: i can't find a case compatible with it. The 2 i ordered on amazon that are suppose to work, thd camera openings are in the wrong spot. 2. I couldn't initially get on google play store. Was very frustrating. Took the phone to best buy, the store clerk was nice enough to trouble shoot. The phone needed an upgrade...already....so i assume it was old stock. Took a while to upgrade, but since, it has been working wonderfully.",Good
"Brought this phone december 2011 and it still works great...shipment was on time and the only problem i had with the phone is that it was locked and a brought it unlocked,other than that great choice",Good
"It was good until the screen locked and would not unlock. The watch still works ,but I can't change the time or anything else because of the touchscreen lock",Good
I bought it on a vacation to USA. It is delivered on time and it works like a charm.,Good
"Un muy buen equipo, el Ì¼nico inconveniente fue al instalar el skype, no fue sencillo y hay que hacerlo varias veces.",Good
"Pictures on this are great! However it likes to randomly go to camera mode even when it's still on the table.Otherwise perfect phone, tolerates my crazy use. Other phones usually overheat at this point!",Good
Like my new little iPhone. Apple said the program was bad why I cannot log into iTunes account an get apps.,Good
"I received the phone quicker than expected however when I opened the package I realized it did not come with headphones as advertised. I inserted my Cricket Wireless SIM card and had phone and texting right away. I was also able to connect to the internet through WIFI but no data. We followed the recommended YouTube video to connect to the network but it did not work for Cricket Wireless. I called Cricket and they walked me through the network set up but it did not work either so they tried to sell me a new phone. Really!!??? I don't believe they were really trying to help! Thank goodness for Google!! Looked up ""how to connect to Cricket Network"" followed the simple directions and WOW it worked!!!!",Good
This product is exactly what it says it will be. A simple little phone that does what phones should doPros:Very smallfits in your wallet (although don't be fooled it will make your wallet quite bulky)The vibrate is pretty goodso far sound quality has been goodCons:Screen is pretty small (although that was expected)menu is not the easiest thing to deal with (but if you play around enough you'll get it),Good
"Sort of ticked that the AT&T version has a locked bootloader, meaning it's difficult to load custom ROMs. Other than that it's actually quite a nice phone even if it is a little old by now. I have an M7 and find I'm a bit jealous of my wife's G2 :)",Good
I brought this phone for my mom on Christmas. It is taking her some time to get used to considering she is old school but she likes it.,Good
My son ate my phone and I needed a new replacement for it that was practical. This phone works great with AT&T. Some of the basic functions work a bit differently than most AT&T phones I've had and that is the only reason I lost a star. The phone came very quickly despite it being mother's day weekend and in a very well protected box.,Good
"The phone lasted a long time, my problem was more so with the inability to set alarms and when you set to-do items on your calendar and set an alarm to go off no sound went off to warn you.",Good
"The Pantech Pocket P9060 is a good phone with flaws that can be annoying, but rarely frustrating. It seems that the phone has a problem with having a lot of apps on at the same time, which is not always the users fault because there are some apps in the phone that run in the background. The keyboard is really bad, so one app you will need to get is a keyboard app. Then texting and typing become better, but no one should have to do that. Then there are times when the phone automatically turns off then restarts by itself. It happens often enough for me to call it a problem, and I have never dropped my phone or subjected it to anything that can actually cause malfunctions in a phone. Overall, the pros of the phone outweigh the cons if you are not crazy about phones. If you want a really good phone, get something else. This is mostly for a person who wants a normal phone, with some smartphone capablities.",Good
"Great phone, so far I have used it in Canada as well as the states. Will see how it works in Europe next. My only gripe is losing one of the sim cards to the SD card for expanded memory. There is a hack for this but I haven't done it yet. It involves sticking the sim chip to the back of the SD card to have a dual slot.",Good
"Great phone to be used internationally and also very stylish, looks really nice! Great first phone for teenagers",Good
"Takes awhile to get used to, but the product overall is pretty great considering the fact that its a phone and a top-notch digital camera. I only wish there were more lenses on the market that matched up with this technology.",Good
"originally i was expecting a flat phone but I got a more different battery , and a cover bigger so , the phone is working good . but not skinny as it is, and mr roman did not said anything about this modification, only used ,",Good
The phone is not really in a new shape but is working I had to spend another $125 before the phone could work with my T mobile carrier.,Good
"It's a sweet phone, and it is meeting my expectations!The only gripe I have is that the phone was advertised having more memory than it had when it arrived. My suggestion: the product advertised should match exactly the product which is shipped.",Good
"I broke the screen of my Nexus 5 and was scrambling to get a quick replacement (while my Nexus was being repaired by LG). This phone served as a good backup, and for $100 I don't have any regrets. Just note that the screen is going to look blurry when compared to a high-end phone due to a lower resolution (you'll get used to it), there isn't a front-facing camera (no selfies), and after snapping a few pictures or videos coupled with a bunch of apps, you're going to run out of storage space quick (investing in a cheap SD card is wise for this phone).My Nexus is back and I'm not using this phone at the moment, but whenever I have another issue (or a friend has an issue and needs a quick backup), this one is ready for duty.",Good
"Did not get the charger as seen in the pics go another one which i didn't need , im from Jamaica it works great i tested it on Digicel . Apart from the charger hick up the phone is awesome and everything else is great.",Good
"It was what I was looking for. I do not have a smart phone, but I text with my kids a lot. So the qwerty key board slide out is what i wanted. It works great for my needs.",Good
Great case for the price. Sometimes it is hard to make the phone hook into the clip. Otherwise great case.,Good
"I got this phone literally the day after I ordered it! I was pretty impressed with the shipping. I'm using the phone now to write this. It's slightly glitchy which I don't mind, my last phone was so much worse. My only problem is that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. I just bought a portable charger so I won't have to worry about finding an outlet to charge my phone.",Good
This is a gift and has not been used yet but it is what I expected.,Good
Works well for the price. Sometimes the screen becomes unresponsive and other times if you press one button it will press a different one. Otherwise it's easy to set up. It comes with a menu item where you can scan the QR code and download the app.,Good
"Pretty neat phone. It is what you'd expect from Samsung, but I find it is just a facelift along with minor improvements over the S4 Mini. Still a good phone though.",Good
"The phone is cool and I like it, the delivery is also good even I requested to deliver the goods to my friend's hotel. However I don't know why I can't register this phone at Samsung's website per Google's link, though I don't use it at US but in Malaysia instead. I contact both Amazon & Wireless Everything, but no solution & feedback till to today.",Good
"Recently got the Mate 8 handset along with its basic accessories (headphones, USB cord, Huawei quick charger and its adapter) and everything appears to be in good working order. All was sealed and well protected in original Huawei packaging, and received on time by the shipper.",Good
I have just two three weeks with this phone and it has worked great.good screen resolution; a camera of 5 megapixel; and 4GB internal memory. I'm not complaining. better than a blackberry and was acquired at a good price.the detail is the battery because when you open many applications are quickly exhausted; Rest well,Good
"It met all possible expectations for a midrange/budget phone. I'd recommend it for anyone searching for a midrange smartphone with premium quality, material, and features.",Good
Great phone - too bad it doesn't acknowledge any mobile data frequencies in the USA.,Good
"Great phone, like new and fast delivery. Charger did not work but not a problem we have several Samsung charger.",Good
"Good phone, truly the I-phone of the android crowd.received a used product from the seller though.",Good
"Never owned a palm phone.It was small but cute. Nice interface and os is very different.Wonderful design, fast and snappy os, overall. I will give 80%.",Good
"The only issue is that the buttons on the keyboard sometimes don't register if you don't press hard enough. Otherwise, the phone is sturdy and easy to use. If you are looking for something newer than a basic flip phone but not a smart phone, this is a good one to go with.",Good
"The phone belt clips are made well, and fit tight on the iphone. I am very happy with them.Just didn't expect them to take 4 weeks to get to me.",Good
"The phone arrived when expected. It is refurbished, but it doesn't show any signs of wear. Battery was charged to 88% upon opening. It comes with a 90day warranty. Picture and sound are amazing. The only problem I have found is that the phone will randomly restart for no reason. It has plenty of storage space, bit does not have a micro SD slot. I am satisfied with this purchase so far.",Good
"Phone came within the Prime shipping timeline. Only gripe is that the description does not state that the phone is an international version (using it in the US). It did not come with a charger that I am able to use in an outlet. Not to sure what to do for warranty if I needed to use it.It's a great phoner. Works great on the TMobile network. I just needed to change everything to US settings. Super bright and vivid colors. The camera is great with a lot of settings. Seems like Samsung put a lot of their own stuff on the phone like an app store and various apps, that can only be disabled. The Flipboard Briefing is useless to me and cannot be uninstalled either.",Good
"Received it 1 week after ordered. It came in with all accessories as advertised, worked really good as expected. It is worth the money. I wished the battery packed a little more power than 1500mAh. Good product for its price.",Good
"I go through one of these about every 6mths. Wish it was more durable, but solid phone overall. To be fair any other phone would probably break on me within a week.",Good
I use the camera a lot but it crashes quite often so i have to reset it.,Good
"My son like it, he said it doesn't take much data and it good to use it in another country.",Good
I am very pleased with The Samsung Rugby 2. Very simple To use. However I do like to be able to look at a manual. It does not include a hardcopy manual with the phone. It took forever to download on my computer.,Good
It's a little bit difficult to reach all of the screen due to the thickness of this case. Very sturdy though.,Good
"Excellent team, the only thing wrong is that here in Venezuela, there is no replacement for this brand of equipment, it would be great support in this regard with the respuesto",Good
Its a great phone! only problems if you have to much going at once it restarts on you. Other wise im very satisfied.,Good
"10/04/2013My husband has been having problems with this phone, the display screen does not light up so he is not able to view the incoming calls.Not able to send a text or take pictures, or take videos.The battery does not hold firm in place.This has been a very disappointment.No, I would not recommend anyone to pruchase this product.Thank you",Good
"The seals on the box were broken, no sim card, thankfully I had one from another phone. Otherwise I like this phone for what I use it for.",Good
It's nice but if you live in Venezuela is pending can not be used for Digitel line. You have to be careful with the GSM number of each telephone company in Venezuela,Good
I like my phone It's really useful.it's rare and unique in its kind.so great for me actually .,Good
Phone was received in very good condition and works really well. The only problem I have noticed is there is sometimes a delay when making calls-not sure if its the network or phone.,Good
After my nexus 6 took a dive in a lake I was stuck in deciding whether to move to the newer nexus or staying with the moto nexus. I opted for the 5x. The phone itself for the money is unbeatable. As far as comparing it to the hardware the N6 had this comes up short but still a fine phone. I think I would be a bit happier if I would have gone with the 32gb vs only the 16gb.,Good
"Been using the phone for few days, I have to say it performs really well. 4.6"" is the perfect screen for me and I love the notification light.Just one flaw, it is pretty heavy",Good
Phone was good condition looks just like new. Delivered promptly. Clean esn. Battery life isn't the greatest but its alright.,Good
"el equipo en terminos generales es muy sencillo, es totalmente nuevo, el problema es q en venezuela no agarra 3g con todas las operadores solo con digitel, deberia ser con bandas abierta a cualquier operadora en 3 g",Good
"This is clearly one of the best phone l have l can think of in terms of my needs. A salid machine that does everything telephoning. I have brought several but this is different, solid and reliable simple.",Good
I love the phone but the first level of volume is too high and it cannot be adjusted...I cannot listen music with the earbuds....good for loud people!,Good
"The phone works well. It's not the best, but it worked up to my expectations.",Good
"I love my phone. Would buy it again. I just gave it 4 stars bc the back cover is realy cheap material and it scratched in no time, but I considr this a good phone.",Good
"Only had this for a little while, but so far it appears to work well. Only wish the T-Mobile logo/tune didn't appear/play every time I boot it up.",Good
i havent recieved this phone in the mail just yet and i cant wait to get it but now to get to the point of what im trying to ask i ordered a samsung galaxy note battery cover basically the back of the phone guess u can say anyways what im wondering if i ever have to put this battery cover on the back on the phone would it fit or did i buy it for nothing i bought it just in case the original back that comes with this phone happens to break just for back up never know rather be safe than sorry i do plan on adding more to this review when i recieve the phone in the mail by the way with my opinion and thoughts on the phone,Good
"Performs well. Nice bright screen. Quick response to Apps given the Quad-core processor. Better than average battery life considering I get Push e-mails all day and night. Only using one SIM for now with simpleMobile. Pulls in signal well with few dropped calls. For such a large phone, the speaker lacks luster! so almost useless hands free, BUT, works fine with bluetooth in car! Still a good value, and I have purchased many, many off market phones. I'll keep this one!",Good
"the phone is very fast and fancy. feels light in your hands like u arent holding anything. I DONT KNOW IF is my phone alone but sometimes the wifi goes and comes back when i go to put it on but its on. so that's the only problem,",Good
"Great for a refurbished phone only had one visible defect very very minor ""dink"" on the side where the chrome border is.... took a while for delivery though looks like it has a brand new screen, battery, battery cover, and new camera did not come with stock charger or headphones, but came with a usable charger. description says white phone but it was refurbished to be black, i prefer black. overall great phone for being refurbished.",Good
Good phone and simple to use and it doesn't cost that much. I love the design. I enjoy it every day,Good
"4 plus year old model works as expected. Good solid feel. Replacing same era Windows phone that no longer plays all CNN and YouTube videos. There are also 10 apps on iPhone I use that are not available for Windows phone.Office ,Onenote, and Onedrive are all available on iPhone.",Good
The is superb...i love the thin design and the dimension of this phone...the features and the quality of camera is one of the quality i've seen.,Good
"I bought this to replace my galaxy s3 when it started to break, and I am very pleased.It has some qualities of a flagship phone at flip phone price,",Good
Great phone it works fine had no problems with it so far. Bought it to replace my brothers last phone that he lost.,Good
"If you just want a simple phone it is hard to find. This one has GPS, email, Camers/video, and some other stuff I don't need or want. Good news is that I can disable or not use most unwanted features. So I have a small simple device for use as a phone . The text and voice messages are nice and not a problem. Battery lasts over a week on a charge if I turn it off a night. Totally satisfied.. No sim card. Verizon took 5 min to change me info to new phone. Left old phone in donation box . I think you can do the trasn fer of info your sel with a phone call.",Good
"This was a good deal. condition is good, device is unlocked and works with any GSM Network. Only problem was got a pink instead of black.",Good
"You get what you pay for this phone great for my work, to read some emails and take pics on the field.",Good
"this is a good camera phone at less price. excellent camera.no complaints as such. I have this for 6-7 months and hanged only once, this could happen to any other phone too.good product..",Good
For the price is really good some problema when you browsing Messenger list the battery are maizing size is perfecto definition good and lot of feutures really happy.,Good
I love the phone and it works well in every country I have been. I don't like the micro sim form factor and the fact that the battery cannot be changed. the whole thing is getting too close to the very reasons why I don't like Apple... Hope that will change in future versions. Wireless charging works like a charm. Battery life is very low though.,Good
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,Good
"Great product. The quality of speaker is great. Excellent keyboard, and top-notch battery life. but it still has flaws since the model is now outdated.",Good
"L LOVE THIS PRODUCT, THE ONLY PROBLEM L BEEN HAVING IS THAT THE PRODUCT HADCHANGE TO OTHER RINGTUNE, KEEP MAKING ME TO STAY ON ONE RINGTUNE.OTHER THAN THAT THE PRODUCT IS OKAY.",Good
"I wanted to write this review mainly to share information on this product. The product reached well before said time. It was delivered in good condition. The phone is as equivalent to buying a samsung galaxy s7 edge in a carrier store.Only disadvantage that I have come across so far is - The samsung pay app doesn't work in this phone.So if you are interested in Samsung pay, you should consider other options.",Good
Everything about the phone is great except for the speed processor. I don't have many apps yet but many Times it take more then 6 seconds to change screens or pull up browser or apps. However overall the phone is great.,Good
"I have not completely reviewed all the necessary and relevant operations of this phone. Having said that, a four-star rating is a very sign and so far I like all the features that I have seen. By the way, I would certainly consider this phone for a sibling of mine.",Good
I received the phone on time. It's in very good condition. I put in a sim card that I had from T-mobile and it works fine. It came with ear buds and a charger which unfortunately doesn't work. Overall I'm satisfied I've only had it for a few weeks but everything ( apart from the charger) has been OK so far. I would buy from them again.,Good
"It's a good phone, the only thing that annoys me about it is I lose wifi connection randomly pretty often but only for a minute and then it's back. Not really sure why it does that.",Good
"if you know what you're getting into with this phone then you should be happy with it. the battery is excellent, if you are using it outdoors the e-ink display is perfect. speaker is loud as is the earpiece and the ringer volume could wake the dead! menu is simple to use.only major con for me is that it's only a 2g phone and AT&T is putting more money, effort and time into their 3g calling network. so coverage is going to shrink and get less reliable over time with these older phones!",Good
"It took firmware upgrade easily.Nice shape and color.Good processor and fast.And the seller shipped the item before the expected delivery date.Works fine with ultra,T-mobile,simplemobile etc. You'll need to charge the battery at least twice.After using more than two months,I think I can give it 3.8 star out of 5.Camera feature is cool.Sound clarity at its best.",Good
"Purchased for upcoming European vacation. Bought AT&T SIM card from Walmart for use locally, works great. Will purchase 2nd SIM card once we arrive so that we can stay in touch amongst ourselves.",Good
"I can not receive picture texts. Otherwise I love the phone. It is easy to use, it is a great size and quality. If someone could help me figure out how to get it to receive picture texts I would be 100% happy.",Good
"Pretty good, to be honest. My only problem with this product so far is it was slightly damaged/worn on the back (the letters).",Good
"Excellent phone even though it's now a bit dated. Only drawbacks are lack of microSD card, and the battery life though decent, could be longer.",Good
"very nice phone. sleek and sturdy design, very easy to personalize. speakerphone is loud enough. reception is also awesome. perfect phone for calling and mesagging. idk about internet - im not using it :).",Good
Great product... Love the storage space as well as the accesibility of free apps. I would reccomend this product to other people.,Good
"2 major dissapointments, first battery life... not more than 48 hours... second the battery seems to be somewhat small for the the phone, so when you apply pressure to the phone on certain possitions the phone turns off... i fixed this by putting a little piece of paper so it could press the battery toward the contact...the phone itself is very nice... i like the feel of it and how it looks, also the price is very good, its a real international phone (i use it in Costa Rica with no problems), and it has a lot of functions that many phones in this price range do not have. Looking forward to buy a better battery.",Good
Phone is great works fine my only issue is my charger quit charging after two week.,Good
Great phone. Using on Att no contract plan. Bought 2 phones. Both work well. 4 and not 5 stars given because a). Difficult to find a case other than the flimsy cheap plastic ones. b). Speakers are not great and does not sound loud. Not a good phone if you like to use the speaker while talking or for music or in meetings. c). Settings are limited for allowing notifications of emails and SMS and apps.I plan to continue buying blu products. Great alternative phone.,Good
"I've been n95 user for more than one year, experiencing a lot of frustrations in terms of interaction (lack of touch screen, keyboard, speed). Now with my new N97 I feel much more comfortable, navigating in the web, working documents, mails, messages. For videos and photos N97 is as good as N95 (very good), except for the len cover in the N97, that eliminates my worries about damages in it. GPS features are identical in both machines, but I perceived better results in my N97 I guess because of the processor speed (loading maps, etc).In terms of storage capacity, 8GB of the N95 was enough for me, but 32GB in the N97 is even better.Finally, I've read some articles related to the dilemma in the market of touch-screen only vs touchscreen+keyboard in smart phones. After one month with my N97, I bet for the second model.",Good
Came brand new in package. I was able to have Verizon turn it on with no problems. The only things I found difficult was that I cannot get updates for this phone and sometimes it will shut down for no reason.,Good
"This is my second smart phone, My first being the UTStar PCC6700. All in all I think that HTC did an outstanding job in the design and usability of this phone. There are several features and if you happen to order this phone i strongly recomend reading the users manual to find all of its nifty little features. You can find the users manual and the software updates at this link: [...]Communicates seamlessly with bluetooth, Loud speaker phone.Consswitching between the cameras is at times tricky.The stylus is small and at times is easy to loose or forget to replace.",Good
"The watch itself is great but consumers in the US beware of the fine print from this vendor. This particular watch is the International version which is from China. It has no warranty in the US. It does as you for a nano sim card. I went through the setup to see if it worked. At first it would not pair with my galaxy 5. You need to download the Gear app in the Google store or Apple store. It will then pair with the watch and then download software and updates. The watch needs be charged as it comes drained. It will take about 45 minutes to get the software updates from the gear app. During the procedure, it will factory reset the watch which suck because everything was in Chinese. After the update, I was able to set it to English. I was able to get all the features to work, email, contacts, calendar, etc. The various watch faces are very rich looking. The curved look is great but not overly heavy. Just be careful when you buy the watch. The non International version was about $15.00 more.",Good
This was bought for a preteen. They liked the fact that it was a slider phone. I would recommend it for someone younger who doesn't need a 4g phone.,Good
"Perfect phone for a teenager when you don't want to buy that $700 phone that they will likely lose. Works well on AT&T,",Good
Its a great product but is a little on the fragile side given the amount of class in the phone.,Good
"Operating system is impressive. The phone is fast, smooth, and performs as expected. The Moto features are also convenient (Drive, Sleep, Home features are useful and make accessing the phone a breeze). The camera seems fine to me, although I'm not someone who relies on my phone camera to provide professional quality images. The only thing that kept this review from being a 5 star is the battery life. It is not sub-standard by any means, but if with regular, moderate use throughout the day, a full charge will get you about 10 hours of use at most.",Good
"Got this phone for my mom who has learned to text, but still used a flip phone. She really likes it. Makes texting for her so much easier without going to a smart phone. Only draw back is the screen is a bit touchy. Will click phone menus every now and then with on a phone call.",Good
"It's a nice phone and works well, although I highly recommend buying it new as opposed to refurbished. And the charger that came with it was broken.",Good
"Granted I'm not a big tech gadget geek but this is easily the best phone I've ever had. I got this because it was reasonably priced with pretty good reviews but people were labeling it a ""good starter phone"". This is only my 2nd smartphone but there really isn't much this phone can't do. One problem that was annoying was that sometimes whenever I watched videos that were 1 hour or longer the phone would freeze up. I had a problem with that because I had Netflix but I noticed that after a few weeks of turning off the unit for 30 seconds and turning back on weekly, the phone stopped freezing now I can watch long movies like Bad Boys 2 without any freeze .",Good
"it's good and i like it.At date, my only only concern is about the battery. if a lot of applications are in use i have to recharge the battery every day",Good
"The transaction went well, and I like the phone. However it would have been really great if I had gotten an instruction book with the phone. It is a new phone, and I have always gotten an instruction book in the past when I bought a new phone. How am I supposed to know how to use my new great phone if I have no instructions? A white instruction booklet always accompanies new phones. I am having to learn how to use my new and great phone by trial and error. NOT FUN!!! I have e-mailed Cellular City telling them of my problem and asking if they would please send my instruction book. It has been two weeks, and I have not even gotten a reply. I would appreciate at least a reply telling me they are not going to send me an instrucion book. I will not buy anything from them again.It is too bad, because I really like the phone (at least what I have learned so far, BY MYSELF), and everything else about the transaction went smoothly.Cheryl",Good
I had an great experience with the exception I received my package a day later than the original date. Also was a Lil disappointed it didn't come with a house charger which I thought all phone did. Overall I had no problems with phone.,Good
I bought this product because I love taking pictures and hate carrying out a phone and a camera. I am not disappointed with the picture quality and I love the size of the phone. If you don't mind the bulky feel you will love the uniqueness of this phone,Good
so far the phone seems to operate a promised. I had very difficult time synching with my bluetooth earpiece. I wen to T-mobile and they had the same issue. Just as I was about to give up it started working. That was a huge relief.,Good
"It's a good phone, got a European version and has some weird messages in German, but it works. I just liked the S5 more.",Good
"Bought this for my daughter to use on Page Plus, and she likes it. I personally am not a fan of Apple products (can't replace the battery, no memory expansion options, have to use iTunes on the computer, etc) but the phone does what she wants.",Good
the phone I actually received was white and not the grey I ordered. The main problem I am having so far is the phone won't link up with my Wi-Fi and I can't figure out how to clear that setup attempt and reset the phone and try again. This is my first smartphone and I have never used Android very much. I hope I can figure things out so I don't simply have a costly paper weight!,Good
I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less.,Good
"Fast shipping, came in sealed box new from factory! First smart phone and so far I like it!",Good
love the phone but due to our being an international phone it does not have 4g speed. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.,Good
i did have this phone for about two months. it has great specs. but new smartphones with great quality materials and high specs leaves this one behind. but from the price point it is still a good phone to have if you don't have enough means for new flagships.,Good
"excellent, clear, fast and easy to use, but it does not link songs (e.g. mp3) directly as a ring tone.",Good
"It is a nice phone,I buy it to used when I traveled outside the US,I loved it,good smartphone for the price.",Good
The background is white and not blue. It works well in Brazil. the instruction manual does not explain how to unlock.,Good
"Nice phone but the fingerprint scanner feature does not work. I called Samsung about this and they told me that due to the recent Android update, the fingerprint function would not operate until a waiting period of 48-hours. The tech rep further said that since this technology is 'creating many problems with customers', several carriers are discontinuing it entirely. She also told me that if it doesn't work after that 48-hour period, it probably never will.Addendum: Sure enough, after waiting 3-days (my guess is they don't count weekend days), the fingerprint scanner finally worked. That still doesn't quite excuse the response I received from Samsung.",Good
Everything was excellent. I got the phone from a third party and everything was good except it didn't come with Motorola branded charger or the device to open the sim tray but other then that it was excellent.,Good
"It's everything i hoped for in a cellphone. It is fast, beautiful,though the camara doesn't really take great pictures in low light or dark spaces. Eveything else is just perfect!",Good
We paid over half the price of what Sprint tried to charge us for a replacement phone.The price was right and the phone shipped on time. We changed the phone registration ourselves and saved $35 that the Sprint store wanted to do the same thing.,Good
"The cell phone is filling expectations for the price. The battery does not deliver as expected, with very few capacity of operation, even when the phone is on, but not used.",Good
"This is the best Android I ever had, it works very well, quality of pictures are great and the power lasts very long, every one out you should get the SGE 1437",Good
I had the exact phone b4 and that is why I bought another just like it. I know it is unlocked but I thought it was a brand new one??? But somethings keep popping up for me to enter into a contest and pick some gifts and I do not want that. it's not like I bought it from my cell provider so I can't call them to find out of how to get that gone. I'm not technical savvy - & don't want to be - that's why I bought the same phone that I've had for 2 years.,Good
"Speaking as a customer who's sole interest in this device was to keep it off cell towers and use it only for wifi and with my LG Bluetooth headset or Proscan Bluetooth Soundbar... I'd rate this a four as It took the place of a Samsung Precedent dinky winky phone that couldn't run Frodo well. No Frodo.. No.. (LOTR joke)This phone married a Silicon Power 64GB microSDXC well and provides ample CPU and GPU to run KODI..I'd suggest the (XBMC/Kodi BOX skin if you go there.Awesome IPS display for off angle viewing,Battery nothing to write home about.. It survives the typical 8 hour day.Hated the headphones that came with it.. they have those mushroomed uncomfortable hard fit, and sound tinny compared to my LG Tone Wireless.I've experienced the situational (WTF touchscreen)I've not modified the phone other than in the Accessibility option to TAP/HOLD Long option. but nothing keep this thing from wigging out when it is charging and you try to do anything with a finger..",Good
I like it. The only thing that is slightly annoying is the speaker on the back.,Good
"sometimes has some problems when playing videos, audio is out of phase, I have to restart the phone",Good
"because the product deserve this rating , as it delivers all that is stated of it , one observation is that is gets a bit warm & the battery seems to empty quickly",Good
"This is exactly what I wanted. Came in official box, with USB cable, wall socket adapter, and headphones. (Plus official phone battery) The device is in 100% brand new condition. But, beware! This is the TMOBILE varient of the Nexus One. This phone will work on At&t, but it will NOT get 3G speeds. It works just on EDGE (2G) like the original iPhone. That should be mentioned in the description. (If it is, then I missed it)",Good
Good overall but they sent me a really weird charger that did not fit into USA outlets.,Good
I was expecting the blue version of this phone but received the red which is fine as well... the product was packaged very well and not damaged at all and had everything in it was supposed to. It also arrived early which was a plus. It wasnt supposed to arrive until after the 9th and i received it on the 5th. so far im very pleased and would recommend this seller to friends.,Good
"I think this is a great phone. The problem is that when I received it, it had already been opened. Amazon sent me a package that someone had returned. They are taking it back. The other problem is the ear piece speaker. You can;t determine when the phones were manufactured. Any phone manufactured before around mid February was probably manufactured with the faulty ear piece speaker. You can order then get it fixed if it fails under warranty, but that is a pain for me as i don't live near a Nokia care Center.",Good
"Appears to be a solid little phone for the price. It would be nice if it had separate ring tones for email, text and other system notifications instead of being all lumped together, but that is a small item. The home screen defaults to the furthest screen to the right instead of the middle screen, weird but not a show stopper. I have yet to try navigating on the road with it but i expect no problems.",Good
PHONE HAS GREAT FEATURES AND IS EASY TO USE . FOR SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT NEED OR WANT A SMARTPHONE . THIS PHONE IS A GREAT PHONE TO HAVE .,Good
"I like the raZR phones by Motorola because of their sleek design. This phone works well but I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because 1. the description said satin pink color the phone is hot pink (luckily it matched up with my favourite tank top) and 2. There is not much to do on it, no calculator or calender - it's sorta boring. BUT I love it! I love it! for its design.",Good
My brother-in-law asked me to buy the Galaxy Note 3 for him. He is very happy with the phone and just likes it.,Good
The replacement back was thin. We are using an outter box cover so this should not be an issue.,Good
"Love Blackberry and Blackberry phones. This handset was great.But, this was their Nextel phone - which has since been 'Sunsetted' by Sprint.So, now this handset is no longer valid on any carrier.",Good
"Wish the price was lower when I bought it but this is in my opinion the last good phone before the non removable batteries and removing the sd card slot. Would have kind of liked the usb 3.0 with quickcharge on this though, the battery is a weakpoint. The battery will also get hot and or drain quickly. Always have portable battery on hand.",Good
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,Good
"The battery couldn't charge effectively, ,it is from the very first day. I would love to get another one becouse I like the product ,",Good
"No good charging usb phone connection. Insulation on cord already broken and peeled off! Naked wire braid, about an inch and a half, exposed! Only about a week and a half old. Terrible cord, great phone!",Good
The screen times out while I am using the phone. And my low light camera isn't functioning properly.,Good
"Positive:- Good condition, no scratches! Is like a new in outside.- No software and speed problems, like a new too.- Working great on Brazilian network, I believe is really worldwide.Negative:- The battery is not 100%, I believe that battery is long 20-30% less than original.Neutral:- Don't came with the earphone and the original box, but is fine to a refurbished one.",Good
"Processor is not fast enough. Upon the first month of use, with almost no additional apps and mainly used for SMS and WA rather than calls, it remains charged for 2 or 3 days, better than the average cells.",Good
If you don't have a note 4 then you didn't use any smartphone. I love it.,Good
"Didn't want to sign a contract with a major phone company, plus I wanted sometime by the very next day, cause my S2 finally decided to hit the dust and flat out stopped turning on. I didn't want to spend over $400 either. I was happy with my S2 and didn't need anything super fancy so i went with the S5. I've been very happy with it since i got it. (been about 6 months now) It was easy to switch over to Consumer cellular as an unlocked phone. My only complaint is sometimes (very rarely) it shuts off..... It can be due to it maybe having to much running in the background and i forgetting to close aps that are running. its done this about 4 times since I've had it which isn't bad i think. other than that its been working great.",Good
"Really like this phone, takes a while to get used to, very sensitive touch screen, but once you use it for a while you get used to it. The keypad is very wide and easy to text with, really like it. But surprised by the answer buttons, they aren't actually buttons but are touch screen symbols. So far, a great little messaging phone! Not had any glitches or freeze ups so far.",Good
Arrived on time looks great and works fine so far. Haven't figured it all out yet.,Good
"I received the product in a timely manner. Started using it without a problem. Slipped in my SIM card and bingo! Got all my data from my old Palm from the laptop backup, no problem. Shortly after, I noticed that several keys weren't working. Particularly annoying was the right upper case and Return key, as well as the m and o keys.Sent the product back, was promptly refunded and ordered a new one. We'll see!",Good
Many features did not work on straight talk and pictures are always upside down. Okay for the price. Phone was in good condition and is as represented by seller. I did my homework too about the types of phone operating systems that would work on Straight Talk.,Good
Great cell phone has a really nice screen. Works great with metro pcs. Really fast speeds if your in a good area. Battery lasts me 2 days with heavy use. Just waiting for Kit Kat update.,Good
"I love that I can put my id, credit card, etc in the back. So easy for when I go out and go to the gym.",Good
"Not the best tablet I've ever had, but works great for the price. Tends to lag a little.",Good
The product us excellent. The only thing that was not mentioned was the fact that the phone is prone to scratching even when used with bare fingers. I was wiping out the dust and my nail caused a scratch. The phone is useless with out a protective film put on even before first use. Be careful about this when you buy itUp Date: Upon close inspection I have found that the phone came with a screen protector already installed.I have also noticed that the scratches are on the protector and not on the phone glass. Phew.. I am happy now. I shall be using the phone right away. I have switched my ATT IPhone SIM and a SIM from Airtel India into this phone and have been using it since last evening. I am satisfied for now but lets see how it fares in a month or so. Shall update ten,Good
"Love my phone, the only thing battery don't last as long as I thought, I have to full charge it 2xs a day (I think it depends on the use during the day) and other thing to mention screen protectors don't work well on edge they come out quickly when you put the cover. But besides that its a great phone, I compare it to a IPhone 6 and this phone haves more features then an IPhone 6 camera is way better both video and pictures.",Good
"There are not many phone in this price range when buying unlocked and this is one of the best. The performance is fine for every day tasks and the call quality is decent. For this price you can not expect much from the phone, and it performs mostly how you would expect... decent for almost all uses. My biggest complaint about this product is the storage space, after the software, you only have room for a couple of apps and pictures. Overall this phone is the best for the price, but do not expect it to perform like a brand new flagship phone.",Good
"Love how fast my shipment arrived. The packaging was nice and brand new. There were no instructions but there are small numbers and letters on it that tell you the order of how you're supposed to put it on. Only down side is how big it is, but I need the protection so I'm going to suck it up lol. Very cute though.",Good
Dual sim is awesome! Strong memory with room to increase. Just need to have more accessories to create an even better,Good
"Good simple non-smart phone, for someone who just wants to communicate. Keypad is adequate, maybe too small for some. No real complaints.",Good
went to this phone because i had one before and it worked well. No longer needed all the bells and whistles of a droid. Good phone and good price.,Good
"I bought this phone to use with Cricket Wireless. I bought it from Amazon because I didn't particularly like any of the phones that were being offered by the store itself. This phone is great for anyone that wants full smartphone power to use with a prepaid carrier such as Cricket or Straight Talk. It is compatible with any MVNO provider that uses AT&T or T-Mobile for their coverage.I love Android phones because they can be tinkered with. You can put your own software on there if you want. There isn't a huge community around this phone because it isn't in very wide circulation. However, XDA developers has plenty to offer if you know where to look.I took one star off because this phone runs on an Intel processor instead of an ARM based chip, which is what most smartphones use. This typically isn't a problem, but there have been a few times where I've found apps that simply would NOT run on this phone because of it using the Intel processor.",Good
"Always been an Android and Samsung fan, but the S4 and S5 were disappointing in my opinion. The S6 edge however restores it's rightful place with the top end Android phones.It's quick, looks great and packed with features. Would hope for better battery performance, but you can't have everything",Good
this an good phone the only down fall the battery goes fast. I have to charge once an day.,Good
I like the phone. It's in very good condition to be a used phone. The only thing I don't like about it is the battery life.,Good
This phone sounds great and feels great. I wish the text messaging app was better and I don't like the placement of the power button. Those are small issues that I can deal with. The best phone around for $249.,Good
"I like the phone. I do a lot of texting. I got it in a very timely fashion. In fact faster by a couple of days then what was said. Keyboard is a bit awkward. Keys in the wrong place, some need to be hit more then once minor stuff like that. I just need to re adjust my keying. Keyboard will lock up if you ""delete all"" from the in or out box while in the options menu. Scared me at first.I thought my was phone broken after only a few days but after waiting a few minutes all came back to normal. So i just do any deleting from a different menu.I am disappointed that I can not receive pictures. I can take them with no problem and send them OK but not receive.My biggest complaint, however is not with the phone but with Amazon. The day after I bought it they dropped the price by 50%. That would have saved me about 40/50 bucks. Wish I known that was coming. Didn't know any way to follow up on that either.Overall I still give it 4 stars. Its been 2 months and I used it every day.",Good
"Unless your phone cam broken, i don't see what you can complain about . . . for the price. I downgraded from a smart phone to this, for many reasons that only the wise understand. It hooks up to my mac so i can load music and talk on to the 16gig memory card that i stuck in there. The memory gets full quickly so don't plan on saving messages, you will have to delete them once every 2 weeks. The calendar for notes does not seem to work. AND maybe the 1 thing that i will say about it is that it does not notify you when you have a new voicemail. I have dropped it a few times, it's still ok. The battery life is badass! And its got blue tooth. I use Ultra-mobile. Careful you do not detach the sim card from the surrounding body, making it micro sim. You have to keep it intact to normal sim size!!",Good
"Definetely handy. Compact, battery lasts a long time, useful as an alarm clock, and the dual SIM card feature is nice. It's just hard to get used to texting the old-fashioned way again, and sometimes it does crazy things when I'm trying to compose a text (erases recipient's number). It's a good phone for travel purposes though.",Good
"I really like the Defender cases, but unlike my previous version (iPhone 4 Defender) the outer rubber cover is smoother and easier to mark up. Using the fingerprint reader is fine so long as you setup the fingerprint with the case on because the height of the case slightly interferes with the angle of my thumb. The opening for the rear camera and flash is great and doesn't appear to interfere with taking photos. The ""plugs"" over the sound mute switch, headphone jack, and lightning connector sit flush and don't need massaging to sit flat like my old case. That said, the ""plug"" covering the lightning port is fairly difficult to open, but I'd rather have that than it opening up all the time letting in dust.In summary, my only real complaint is how easy the case is marred with everyday use discoloring the blue to a teal color where the holster rubs the phone during insertion.",Good
"This is the second verizon phone we have purchased that said ""no cotract required"" but Verizon would not activate without a contract.. Amazon needs to investigate before allowing anyone to advertise that caption.",Good
The Phone itself is an absolute 5* Rating. However the Bloatware from the Korean 3rd party was not expected and although I was able to disable it (Olleh) it still continues to display the Logo at start-up.,Good
"I initially gave this phone a bad review, and only rated it 2 stars. But it has performed quite well since that initial review. Actually,it has performed very well. The pictures from the camera (13mp) are fantastic. The apps download quickly on wi-fi, I suspectthey will download as quickly on my data plan(3g) also. This 5.5 in phone is big, but not to big. The 8gb Rom, 1gb Ram is sufficient,although you get about 4gb rom because of the preloaded apps, but that amount still allows you to download a lot of apps before youhave to go to an sd card. So, I am very satisfied with it now. pj44pj",Good
"I've written a detailed review on Medium. [...]Good- Unlocked- No bloatware, minimal extra apps installed- Dual SIM- SD Card slot- Screen was nice and bright with decent contrast- Performance was on par with expectations for this price range- Battery life was very impressive, but I use it mainly without a SIM card/data connection so that might help big time.- The phone was comfortable to hold and the back plastic is pretty ""grippy"" which is nice.Bad- Camera is very bad, do not buy if you plan to take lots of pictures- Not a fan of the power button. It's small and I don't like the ascetics or feel of it either.- Once I added a bunch of app and widgets the phone really started to slow. I ended up tweaking a bunch of start up apps and using some ""tuning"" apps to get things running faster.",Good
"This is a great, stylish phone which holds up a lot better than some people say. However, it isn't very loud. It's often hard to hear people talking when it's on the highest volume. Speaker phone helps some, but that means everyone else can hear your conversation and no one wants to be like Dennis Franz on those Nextel commercials - annoying.",Good
"Like the size and HSPA+ speeds. I enjoy the multi window display.Went to T-Mobile and purchased a microsim card and was even able to port my old phone number over. Only con I found was that the screen alone sucks down 40% of battery power. But that is my .02 cents. A big plus is that you can swipe to text, you just have to enable it in settings.",Good
I like it! I finally switched from IPhone 4 to 6 plus! What a difference it makes! I like it that the screen is big and things are faster. I almost considered Galaxy but didn't want to learn Android. Happy with the purchase but price was bit too high. We will see how long it last!,Good
"I've been using this phone for about two weeks now. It is an excellent device considering the $150 price. I did return one unit due to a dead pixel, and the replacement was victim to random and frequent reboots (though a factory reset seems to have fixed this and the phone has not done it since).I use my phone mostly for reading so the screen size is great. It is 720p so its not the most crisp but its acceptable.The phone can be a little sluggish which is the weakest point for me. I don't play many games or use any really intensive apps but just switching between Chrome, messaging, and other essential apps stutters quite a bit. I would gladly pay a little more money for a model with 2 gigs of ram (as there are not many other options with this screen size).Keep your expectations in check. Some quality control issues and low to midrange specs, but for $150 its a great deal.",Good
"the camara is no so good in the night, but the battery is very good",Good
"my used Pantech phone: for a used one I don't expect it's in excellent condition. it's good, fits my purpose for now until I can decide what phone to renew. I like it.Thank you Seller, thank you Amazon",Good
"After a few years of using HTC, Samsung, and One Plus phones, I am glad to be back on Blackberry hardware. The phone feels sturdy and the keyboard/track pad makes typing and navigating webpages so much easier.My Android apps transferred easily from one phone to this one through NFC. I'm still getting used to working with Blackberry Hub, but so far so good.One gripe is the battery life. My One Plus would last up to 2 full days of moderate use, but this phone may not make it through on while day without a charge... I'm not sure if this is software related, or if it is because of the fact that this phone runs warm. Either way, I hope Blackberry addresses this issue soon in one of their frequent updates. My old Bold had such amazing battery life, so I believe this is something that Blackberry can fix for a five star review.",Good
"This is a really good phone for its cost. The only problem is that it is AT&T branded (despite being unlocked) which means that it has a lot of AT&T apps on it. These take up a lot of space, preventing you from installing apps yourself, and, because it is AT&T branded, you can't remove those apps. If there were a way to remove those apps without rooting the phone, then it would be the perfect cheap phone.Other than that, the interface is easy and functional, it's light, it has good battery life, it is relatively fast (for its cost)... I have no complaints about the phone itself.",Good
"This is my first smartphone. I like it very well. The price was right. The only problems, so far as I'm concerned, are 1) the screen is a little small, and 2) the battery runs down too quickly. I keep GPS and WIFI turned off unless I need them.",Good
A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said. Thanks a lot my friend.,Good
If you like using social networks and don't want to hurt ur pockets then this phone would be perfect for you. The only problem i have with it is its low internal memory.,Good
"I will put it this way. I bought this cellphone from BREED and gave this product 4 stars. For the price you pay, you get a phone that:-has a great camera-it is easy to use and understand (even for my mom and she is 69 years old)-has nice office tools and xbox games-Runs without lagging (if you update the software)THE BIGGEST DISSATISFIER FOR ME! IT'S THE INCOMPETENCE AND STUPIDITY OF MICROSOFT !!!If you are aware, they own NOKIA and Skype!I understand if they are not going to release any microsoft OS updates, but stop supporting skype at all and disabling this from ITS market place; It's completely stupid and ridiculous!! this makes the å¬smartphoneå¬ be almost (if not completely) useless.Yes, you may have LINE app and viber per say, but all my skype contacts can't call me anymore. I can't even log in to my account!!!so overall, great phone with decent specs, but it is a total bummer not being able to use SKYPE at all.This is not the sellers fault but stupid MICROSOFT!!",Good
"Have used these previously. Used them on 8 x 48 plank tiles. Maybe not the best system around, but they work",Good
"Love the look of this phone. Really slim and sleek with a nice rubber back and awesome screen. You have to change your mobile data settings to GSM. Also if you have problems with your data, you have to call your cell phone provider and get things set up with your sim card and such. I was able to make phone calls/text but I was unable to use data. I could only use data with wifi, but not when I was on the road. Took an hour in a chat room with customer service but after that things worked.",Good
"This is my first experience with a Windows phone. Previously I had Android powered phones. There are things I like about both. However, up to this point my Nokia Windows phone has been much less aggravating.",Good
"It is what I payed for. A nice clean used phone. It was completely clean. Not completely reset but that is okay. It's worth it if your okay with a little scratch around the edge. Compared to the price of a refurbished phone, I would buy this any day.",Good
This phone gets too hot when in use.... upgraded to 928... apart from that its a great phone,Good
The Glocalme G1S is a valuable tool for anyone who travels internationally and is responsible for their own cellular usage charges. The system acts as a personal cellular hot spot and allows any device with WiFi capabilities to connect. On a recent trip to the Middle East I was able to get 3G data to allow for Skype or WhatsApp calling / messaging and email at drastically reduced rates vs my cellular provider.Pros- Small portable package to carry in a bag or pocket- Easy to use Android app to control charges- Large volume of data included for the price- LCD display integrated- Good battery performanceCons- Device can heat up when under heavy useOverall a great device!,Good
I used this phone in France during my recent travel there and never had any problems. I bought a local sim card (SFR la carte) and it worked just fine. Although I didn't use many of the features this phone offers I would recommend it without any reservation.,Good
I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and it was the right choice. I tried it out first and compared it to my iPhone. It held up very well and that's why I gave it 4 stars. It's not as good as an iPhone but it is less expensive and holds up well. Surely good enough for a teenager who isn't ripe enough for such an expensive phone.,Good
"Not in quite as good shape as I expected, but was acceptable; I probably had too high expectations.",Good
"She loves it! Thinks the size is ideal for an 11 year old, loves the way it navigates. Talks about the picture quality non-stop and that she can brighten pictures taken at night - wooohooo!",Good
"Great phone, exceptional software. The back of the phone can be pushed in a little making a gnarling noise. This makes the whole look and feel not as solid as it could be. Not sure if this is the case with all units, but I find it a bit distracting.",Good
"I got a Verizon GSM global unlocked product delivered.It did not need a sim to activate the phone. That's good. But when i saw Verizon in the product information, i tried an AT&T sim to check if its actually unlocked and it worked fine. I removed the sim. I'm using the phone just for Whatsapp, camera and sometimes songs/videos. Phone is awesome for pics. 8GB storage is the only drawback. Considering that its an apple phone, it wont let you do much anyway. Transferring photos and syncing stuff is a nightmare if you have been an android user forever(which i am). Otherwise, if your expectation is set right, this phone is an awesome steal.",Good
"What I got is SQN100-1 rather than 100-3. The customer services help me to get 20% refund for the mistake.It is really good for business while not suit for daily use. As I am not a sales person, I need more apps such as purchasing. While BB is good just for real business person. 5 stars for the business hub and no disturbing mode.I used this phone in Singapore and the networks seems not been supported well. No 4G and even less 3G (very slow compared with iphone with Starhub).",Good
Compact & simple. Menu still like authentic c series. Previous users particular with the UI will have no problems. Has not gone out of the country yet though - reason why I got this.,Good
"4.5/5, However, headphones are not included in the package, not sure what is the reason.",Good
"Worked for me in Europe,BUT has a very small touch pad and my finger tips aren't very big... Frustrating to use for texting...or typing in anything",Good
"For now, filled my expectations ..!You feel the quality of the materials, come from a S3 and notice the difference, very fluid and even more with the 253, which improves the launcher, camera and battery life, as with the Galaxy, was not even to late afternoon, but with the Xperia Z, is another thing, I can enjoy it until 20:00 PM that just calls load. For the phone to be perfect, should be getting the update normally and not let him die in time.for me is a 9/10.",Good
"Originally came with a bunch of bloatware, but it seems to have been removed with subsequent updates.It's fast, it's fun, it's battery is good enough for Pokemon Go.9/10",Good
"The phone is good just that when i received it, the flashlight wasn't working but i got a partial refund back. Other than that he phone is hundred percent good.",Good
"Everything arrived in good order. The phone itself is fine, but I guess because its an international version, the internet hasn't been working properly. But this might be an AT&T problem and less of a problem of the phone itself....",Good
"Good and fast.It did not work berry good with T mobile,but is working perfect with AT&T I love it.",Good
"Phone failed after 2 or 3 days, HOWEVER, exchanging it was not an issue and I have very much enjoyed the now working phone I have received from them.",Good
"The N97 is a very complete piece of technology, great resolution and fast internet access, all in addition to a great storage capability (32 GB plus).It is worth every penny.",Good
"It's a really good phone at a very affordable cost, I love it. I have only had it for about a month. I read a few reviews saying the phone acts up after a while, I hope that doesn't happen since there's no warranty for the international version of the J7.",Good
"The phone is a good first smartphone, but as you get used to it, you feel for more.Pros:1. Renowned brand2. Number of apps from OVI store.3. Good battery life.4. Good connectivity to internet via Wifi5. Front facing camera(secondary) for smooth video calls via fring.6. Decent Camera( 5 megapixel) with flash7. Good qwerty keypad.Cons :1. The touchscreen is not smooth.2. The memory supplied(2 GB) is less and gets over within days as you download apps and start using camera.3. Just one home screen.4. Lags with multiple operations.5. Symbian, not due to performance but due to deal bw MS and Nokia, so future uncertain.Overall good first smartphone.",Good
I like it. Some features are doubled such as my apps. It's worth the money that ii spent. Eventually will go back to my Samsung.,Good
"The blackberry is a very nice phone if you looking for a simple phone to get your business done , this phone I bought bran new but I think it was refurbish and market as new but I like it ..",Good
It came earlier that promised so the gift was available for giving. Receiver was pleased & surprised! Haven't heard anything negative so must be ok.,Good
"Being that this is my first 'smart phone', I was pleased. But had only a few gripes (see below). Anyway, the phone is stylish, with a leather case, sweet. It has almost every connectivity to networks under the sun, GSM, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.Keyboard is nice, especially if you don't like clicking keys for the right character. Coupled with an 8 gig mem card, holds all my ring tones and mp3s and pics. Email is right there, messaging is right there. I was not a 'phoneaphile', but Nokia has won me over. I was looking at Blackberries like everyone else, but I wanted to be different. I believe I made a good choice.As for OVERKILL, I live in an area that recently got GSM capability (imagine that). This phone has a lot to offer if your service provider can supply the service.Only gripes, the stylish small size makes type a chore even if it is easier than regular keypad. Last, battery life. Solution, plug it in every now and then. You'll be set.",Good
this model has trouble with sleep. 13-20% battery is gone for night.Also I don't know what can I do now.,Good
this is a good phonethe problem is only the battery case that does not fit perfectly!,Good
"I've had time to write a review since I've had this phone 2 weeks. THIS PHONE IS BIG!! IT'S A TRUE 5.3 screen. The delivery was ON TIME. I am VERY VERY satisfied with this phone. It has done everything the descriptions says PLUS! The Sim card I received from e-bay and Straight Talk is my carrier. Make sure you purchase a Sim card in advance if you are not going to use a current one. BECAUSE OF MY LOCATION my service switches from Straight Talk to AT&T. NOT A PROBLEM for me. The apps from Google Play are easy to download and so forth. My ONLY DRAW BACKS with this phone s the battery life. It sucks. Im attempting to find ways to get better longer battery life AND I am having an issue finding a hard case cover ie Otterbox, Toughwear etc. Ive had it for two weeks and so fay,so good. 4 1/2 stars,worth the money.",Good
"Pretty Awesome, perfect little unlocked phone for a trip abroad, I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and this one is almost identical in shape and size except the launcher is regular android 4.4.2 (AOSP) not touchWiz. Takes a micro sim and one regular. Also has a micro SD slot for storage. Very happy with it's Quality/speed and the price.",Good
"I never received mine but read plenty of reviews it's a Good phone but compair the international version to the usa release, there are processor and other differences, even though both work well ones got higher end parts (screen&processor) I believe it's the USA release you'll have to Google it",Good
The phone is ok but I have ah problem wit charging it whenever I have to charge it u always have to turn it off n it take very long to complet n it always buzz like every 3 seconds when pluged in,Good
Very pleased with this product. However it was missing the earphones that were suppose to be included as stated in the ordering information.,Good
work well for the price sent it to a caribbean island . and my aunt love it.,Good
The phone is cool with some important apps nd user friendly. The only problem is that it has a 5 mp camera but it's cam is sharp anyway.,Good
"If you're on T-MOBILE, PLEASE READ. This phone not being set by and for T-Mobile needs to manually be updated. After setting the APN, give it a day if not sending or receiving MMS's. The fingerprint is awesome; Answering machine, yes answering machine works perfect. Other than that, no major update from the Z3 which I owned before purchasing this one.",Good
"the only problems I have with the team is that I could not achieve link via bluetooth with BFH-8/5538 Sound Logic Bluetooth Foldable Headset, and not if cellular equipment that does not work properly or bluetooth Sound Logic .The rest very satisfied",Good
"Needs better instructions, Also, the store giving connections (att) was not ready to help. But keep it is and all will be well",Good
"This is a pretty damn phone fr the price. The screen is great and bright, the feel of the phone is not cheap at all feeling, This is a really nice phone overall. The camera is the only disappointment I question the 12 megapixel camera count.",Good
My gf loves it! The only problem is with the wifi. It doesnt want to connect or stay connected once it has. If it weren't for that it'd be a 5 star! :3,Good
Good basic cell phone. Full function keyboard good for thick fingers. A little bulky as is common for flip phones. Front cover touch screen or internal keystroke entry. Durable. Handed down to my son after I changed carriers and could no longer use it.,Good
Seems like a sweet little phone. To bad it didn't come with an instruction manual in English.,Good
I really love my Blue Studio Selfie. I have really only one thing to say. The connectors for the battery are really super fragile. I broke one of them. I rigged it so it will still work. The phone and the charger get really hot sometimes when you charge it. Other than that. Its a good phone.,Good
"On Receiving this phone write a review, the phone is much more than i expected, before i got it i want to swap for a blackberry but as soon as it came into my hands i killed the idea especially because it has all the features of a berry - full key, wifi, small and compact, stylish and totally irresistable. I would go as far to say buy this phone and forget about any blackberry they only have name nokia E63-2 can be compared to blackberry and their features, the wifi is off the hook i just turned on my router and that was it. For $200 i would gladly buy this baby over a blackberry again.",Good
"Good, reliable phone, but the screen is small.Good news, it can handle 128 gb microsd cards, at least this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M562LF4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1With all of my music on an 128 microsd card, running the PowerAmp app, I'm in heaven.I wish the microsd snapped into place. It doesn't. You just slide it in until it does not go any further. It has occasionally disconnected, presumably because of vibrations or dropping the phone.Battery life is pretty good.When the phone is dropped, it is sometimes necessary to re-seat the sim card.It is May 14, 2015 and I still don't have the Android 5.x update. My carrier is T-Mobile (USA).",Good
Replaced wife's Samsung with this phone after she laid her old phone on a wet counter top and ruined it.She promptly dropped this one in the toilet but it still works! Can't beat that.,Good
"I use this phone for few hours and found how fast the battery dies after my iPhone SE. But this is not the biggest problem (I assume I'll not use so hard phone in next days). There is no WiFi calling on T-Mobile and may be VoLTE on this phone. At least, I couldn't find it...Updated WiFi: thanks to comments and also talked to T-Mobile representative - WiFi calling is not SONY's problem. So, I'm adding one more star to Sony, take one from T-Mobile :)",Good
If you are looking to cut your cell bill down and still have a smart phone then this phone might be right for you. However be warned that if you are use to Android or Apple phones then this could take some getting use to.,Good
"As a budget phone costing less than 150 bucks, I would say it certainly meets my expectations, hardware-wise. The level of satisfaction on the software side, however, is less than awesome. The phone is preloaded with a bunch of bulky & useless T-mobile bloatwares, which present a huge burden to its miserably little RAM. It took me a while to root the phone and remove pretty much every single one of those bloatwares. Since then the phone has performed great.",Good
"I love this phone, works great! Had a little difficulty getting it activated but now it's working.",Good
So far I'm satisfied with this phone. Its expensive but has a lot of good features. Samsung will not register or warrant this phone because they say its an international device. Not happy about that!,Good
Although we had some issues the company was very quick to contact me and offfer many solutions. Sometimes you run into a bump especially with electronics however customer service is what keeps you coming back. This company offered many options to fix the problem which will have me try them again.,Good
"Very good phone for the price. However, the volume is a serious setback to this phone.",Good
"It works fine. Bit of a hassle to get all the messaging and data function up and running. I still haven't gotten the MMS picture messages to send though.Edit:The phone works great now, just had to add a new apn to run on my carrier's data plan. The sound quality with the headphone jack is a bit poor, too much background static when nothing is playing. Wish that it had more than 1gb of internal memory because it doesn't always pick up that I have 16gb memory card in it.",Good
Very few scratches on the back. Overall I'm happy with product and would recommend it to anyone on the fence about buying one,Good
"Capable phone, works very well with Wifi. Streaming movies and music is a pleasure. Sound and graphics are good. I had trouble hooking up on 4G and had to set it to 3G to make and receive phone calls. This is because the Sim card slots only support 3G and 2G! I purchased a plastic iPhone 6 plus cover for this phone and it fits pretty well.Now having owned this for a few months I am in agreement with my original review. I bought a bluetooth speaker to enhance the sound and am pleased with the result.",Good
"I LOVE THIS PHONE.i lost it before and had to reorder this on amazon.In the beginning, I was worried because the phone had an at&t logo and i had an internet plan.And the internet didnt work for me. BUT, all it needed was an APN settings.

I'm very happy with my phone works great I'm just having a hard time getting a case for it not really sure on what to say or do when buying a case for it. Is there a special thing I need to say when trying to purchase the right one ? If so would someone please let me know what I'm doing wrong thank u in advance everyone,Good
"Very good phone, long battery life, 1 down side is music quality sucks with this phone. Otherwise it is a great phone",Good
"Fine phone, but I needed an unlocked on (my fault for assuming it was already unlocked).",Good
Really like this phone the camera kind of sucks and it freezes on my once in awhile but I just reboot it and it works fine again but for the price I can't complain.,Good
si levanta 3g en venezuela os telefonos me llegaron en buen estado solo que el proveedor fue muy lentooooo mas de 1 mes tardo en llegar,Good
"Just received this, will update with more details, but just wanted to mention one negative and one positive I noticed right off the bat.Positive: Accepts microsd up to at least 128gb rather than the 32gb listed in the phones description.Negative: Android not updateable without third party/root etc. Comes with Android 5.1, but won't install Star Trek Timelines which lists 4.1 as minimum Android version. Probably not a big deal for most, but just a heads up in case. Hopefully that's a quirk with only this one particular app.Overall, seems pretty great so far.",Good
"Nice phone, Love the way it feels in hand. Heavy duty, will last a long time.",Good
"I really like the large screen. The volume controls on the back are somewhat inconvenient, and too close to the power/activate button. Signal quality seems very good. Bluetooth works well between several different devices.",Good
"Excellent phone! Got this phone a month ago and I've loved everything about it, but I would have to say that even though this phone supports slow motion camera, it would be nice to actually have a slow motion feature on the camera... But, in no way is that a deal breaker!",Good
"lynx plus a110 by posh reviewlanguages: english, french, spanish, portugesejoke: intended audience is small handed person that needsa phone for over seas for three month and probably would find it inthe bottom of somebody's purse after three months wonderng whatit is doing there see if it still works bringing all thememories of overseas.

"Excellent device great form fit, finger print scanner is quick, front facing speaker works well. Definitely met expectations.",Good
Purchased for significant other when he lost his phone. He is very happy with it.,Good
"Great phone for the money, more than meets my needs. Only complaint is bloatware, particularly the constant Amazon adds.",Good
"It is Great. I like it. It lacks the led light, but it is still good. I highly recomend this phone",Good
"I like the nokia c3 unlocked cell phone. It works well when I travel. The wifi search & connection is good. For the price I was still able to connect with via text, internet & phone calls. I also like that it is a compact phone fits in pockets & purses.",Good
"Used this one and the Moto G for about a week now.Frankly I was expecting more out of this. I felt that the battery backup should have been a little better. Love the features of the phone though. Handles small games and apps well, the voiceless control is good. And 32 GB for this price range is decent. The size is apt and it offers 4G",Good
Works amazingggggggggg. If youre using tmobile make sure you change your APN to get 4g,Good
"Although the windows apps are a bit limited on this version, the phone is great for my needs and the tilted keyboard makes this an extremely fast and easy note taking and text writing device. The fact that the touch screen is also responsive also makes for a complete feel. Only draw backs are the inability to upgrade to windows 8, the camera is poor in low light and the screen size.",Good
works awesome no problems what all ever except the fact that it over heats from time to time but I guess that's normal,Good
great phone for the price.. easy to use and reliablei would recommended for grandparentsand a real bargin deal,Good
"Excellent cost benefit. It delivers wat it promises. It is working great on the LTE Network in Brazil as well as in the US (one simm per country). The downside I found so far is that it does not connect into 5.7GHz wi-fi networks, only 2.4GHz. Battery lasts pretty long (at least 2 days of normal business/leisure use case scenario), it is light.",Good
I received it the day before today. And I like it because I already own the original z ultra c6833.However my only complaint is the fact that it's not compatible with Metro pcs. But that's okay I will move on to At&t.,Good
Phone is considerably fast and has a bright screen. I needed a 32 gig phone to handle my work e mail and also be able to run dual sims at the same time. This phone handles both quite well. It is not very loud but for the price I would recommend it to anyone.,Good
"To start with when I took the phone into the store to get it switched with the old one the numbers off of the new box were not good. But when we got the phone out charged it and used the numbers off of it, it worked ok. So at first I was a little heaitant that it was real. It all worked out in the long run though.",Good
"desde venezuela valencia, el telefono presenta inconvenientes con el sofware no funciona ahi que hacerle un monton de cosas para que funcione. en fin es un mal producto...! y el vendedor es un un completo inresponsable.",Good
Very good phone at a good price. Only bad thing that you can not use the two sim cards together but is easy to change which sim you .want to use.,Good
I love the phone it has good features and really good camera. Except im paying for 4g network i expect to still get 4g on a 3g phone. Maybe something to work on.,Good
I have been using for about 4 months and I find it very good especially for Cingular/AT&T. My earlier more expensive GSM phones have been unfaithful to me. But this one is very reliable.Plus: Good Battery life Excellent reception Vibration/Calendar/ReminderMinus: Very basic. Sound quality should be a bit better. Speaker is not good.,Good
"I was looking to replace a previous nokia candybar phone, and discovered this one. Charged it up and put in the sim card, the display is nice for the size, the hand set speakers works well, and the microphone can pick-up really well. Nothing fancy just a good upgrade for a phone that was a few years old.",Good
"This is a really nice phone, that's almost a steal at this price. Everything feels feels pretty snappy and responsive. It has a really sleek and sophisticated feel to it.Pros: Easy customization, bright clear screen. Stylus can be used to write notes directly on screen which is converted to text for storing quick notes or sending SMS messages.Cons: On screen keyboard seems better suited to those with smaller fingers. For those with larger hands, I recommend using the stylus. No flash on camera is a definite disappointment. Touch screen sometimes requires a firm press to activate certain options. The PC Sync software that came with the phone could be better.",Good
IT sucks that it doesn't have a removable battery like the Lg G3 and G3 s,Good
"I have used this phone only for internet access through my home internet provider, not with any phone service or outside the home wireless provider. I bought the phone to use overseas (Thailand) with their SIM card. I'll write more after that experience. So far, I've really enjoyed the Windows 10 environment matching my Windows 10 on my home PC. It seems very responsive, synching quicker than my android. I like Cortana, lots of fun and quick. Easy to set up and change the screen for personal needs.",Good
"was basically ok, reached on time, reached with an old OS and needed to be upgraded, also the charger and earphone was not Samsung original,(like in new Samsung buy from the store)",Good
"Gotta say that if you want a brand new phone both in and out including the packing and charging adapter ,get it from the official place, not here. But if you want a g3 that is fully functional and phone it self is brand new not charger and so on, buy it here. The phone is perfect,I think it is bearly touched, but it is open-boxed, and the box is not the origional once( i got a white version and it came with a gold opened box which looked old and a korea version charger. The phone is brand new american version, supposed to be brand new as i think at this point. So phone itself is perfect. The other details, meh......after all its the phone that matters. I guess the 70 bucks short for a reason. Dispite that, this is perfect. Ps: I do think this is the best android phone out there u can buy. Will u notice the difference of 4k display? Yes u will. Nothin is better. Hope this helps your desicion making. Peace",Good
Turning off the moto features will keep the phone cool otherwise it burns like hell.,Good
"This is my first windows phone and so far, I am enjoying it. The price point here is better than if I had bought it in the store I checked (you know, that US carrier that advertises it does not ""lock you into contracts""). The phone does everything I need it to do and the features are exactly as advertised. No unpleasant surprises. My only disappointment is that this particular phone is not ""factory"" unlocked (and the sellers do not claim it is). So ATT branding is on the phone and on some of the apps. Since I use this phone overseas and am not an ATT customer, I would prefer not to have these ATT demarcations on my phone. In the past, I have been more careful to select a factory unlocked phone but overlooked that detail this time. Otherwise, the phone is easy to use and performs well, consistent with Nokia standards.",Good
"Nice phone Sony delivers. I gave it 4 stars because it's a great working phone on Verizon's 3g service, but couldn't help but notice the internal memory is very low. There is little room to download your favorite apps and games.",Good
Good phone. No problems with appearance or operation. I had to replace the battery within a few months. Mildly inconvenient but not expensive or a big deal really. I felt I received a good value.,Good
good features but the phone is a bit buggy. Glitches out and had a couple issues with it in the first week. One of the better options in the $120 range but will probably pay a bit extra next time and get something in the $200 range.,Good
Looks good and works great. The Snapdragon 810 is a little warm. Nothing a case can't fix. It doesn't come with the htc rapid charger. My phone came with a Blackberry charger.... Slow,Good
Good product at this price however it's outdated presently with so many new phones in market,Good
Very pleased with this phone. Is a definite upgrade from my galaxy s2. Screen is flawless and overall immaculate shape. Shipping fast. Only reason for 4 star is cause in the listing it was supposed to come with dock and headphones which I didn't receive. Still very pleased with the purchase.,Good
This is my first Android phone having been a long-time iPhone user (since Gen 1). I found the control to be intuitive and easy to figure out. There are a ton of apps on Google Play. The phone did not have too much bloatware and much of it is removable. I suggest that any user take extra time with the phone settings as there is quite a bit of personalization that you can do.,Good
"Great phone for the price. The graphics are crisp, with no lag even with multiple apps running in parallel. I give it 4 stars because I wish it had a longer lasting battery. Even with stamina mode turned on, I still need to charge it every 1.5-2 days. I usually run online games on it so I may be draining the battery a tad faster than regular use. Still, I wish it had more juice.The reviews about the screen cracking without much abuse may be an exaggeration IMO. At least from what I see with my unit, it seems to be holding up fine. I had to use it naked for the first 2 weeks before I got a Ringke Fusion case for it. I did not have problems with it feeling flimsy at all. The glass front and back does make it feel slippery to the touch. All the more reason to get a case like the Fusion.",Good
A very nice poduct!. I've used the Blu branch for about one year and the products have a good quality!,Good
"There is nothing more special to it than the iphone 4s except a bigger screen. It is nice and does the job, and I love the convenience of Siri.",Good
"hard to fit certain cables and chargers into the bottom of the case. had to buy new ones, which were crap and didn't work, so then ended up machine shopping the super-tough plastic at the bottom of the case all the way off so the old cables would fit. not waterproof now, but i can charge the phone and listen to music, and it is protected very well otherwise, so that's something",Good
"I would have rated this phone a 5 if not for only one issue; it takes about 18hrs to charge complete every time the battery is dead. If you are thinking about buying this phone, you should consider buying one or two extra batteries pluse a cellphone battery charger so you can avoid beining tied down waiting 18hrs for your phone to finish charge. For those who cannot afford an Iphone 4 or samsung galaxy get a pantach they are just as good.",Good
"Samsung always the BEST, for a price this smart phone is very good all the features are excellent!!!",Good
"Phone was purchased for a friend and brought to Angola, West Africa. The phone was delivered on time. It is operating perfectly with no problems in a local GMS system. My friend is very happy with the phone.",Good
"Received it fast!! worked with my verizion service.....Just what my boy wanted, touch screen, since I wont let him have a smart phone.",Good
"Got it fast and was what I wanted. Liked the easy open packing, as usually the Otterbox packaging is like opening fort knox with a knife.",Good
"The phone came without US mms settings but were easily downloaded from the Moto site..It now works great on the ATT network.The phone came with a foreign charger and the wrong US adapter. After contacting Amazon, they immediately sent me the same thing for exchange.I ordered a charger from Ebay and am very happy.The phone is chargable from the mini usb port so I was able to use it until the charger arrived.I would give it a 5 star if not for this problem. Also hope I don't need the warranty.",Good
"To save our niece some money since she was paying extra for a data plan she was not using, we replaced her smartphone with this phone. She likes the key board and other features on the phone.",Good
"For folks who want LTE option on both sims -- this is not the product. Unfortunately, it wasn't mentioned anywhere clearly that only one SIM at a time can have LTE and the other will automatically switch to GSM (2G). I would have given it 3.5 starts, but no option for that. Software wise, one has to fish for things which more intuitive in the older models like S4Mini Dual Sim. I guess I just have to get used it. Battery life is poor though, if LTE is enabled, only way to get around it is enable the power saving mode.",Good
Got this for ma sisters. Got apps installed. Connects with ma country sim..they will like it.,Good
"Great phone for under $60 bucks. Software updates is limited to 6.0, so limited to basic apps downloads.",Good
"I've had this for two weeks now and I'm pretty happy with it. This was a replacement for a broken Galaxy S4, and I haven't noticed much functional difference between the two. Obviously the screen is huge, which I like, and allows for easier touch screen use. I do see what people are talking about on the delay when typing, and I do notice it is more responsive when I press harder. In other words, I'm pretty sure it's the screen protector. I would confirm that, but I hate putting on a new screen protector, so I would rather deal with the delay than do my usual crappy job of putting on a new screen protector.One oddity I have noticed is that the signal strength seems lower than my S4. In areas where I used to have 4 bars, I have 2-3 bars. Hasn't been a big problem, since ""bars"" are completely subjective, but it is troubling.For the price though, this is worth it. I got it at the pre-order price of $80, totally worth it.",Good
And the new charge kit is the same as the manufacturer General non-original use of other very good performance so far hope that the charging line can be lengthened some like some inconvenient,Good
It's a great phone. The screen is big with a real colors. It have a good speed in open the apps. Isn't LTE in USA and in another countries like Venezuela with have only 1 operator with LTE but they not offers this plan with another mobiles whats they don't sell,Good
I liked the phone but quality was ok but I think it could have been better. I will buy another model later because I know some people that love theirs. Mine would randomly reboot??,Good
Software and icons were slightly different than my previous i717 but overall a very dependable phone and a good first smartphone choice as a gift for a family member.,Good
it is very bulky so beware when placing in pocket. it does however extend your battery life through the day.,Good
"Ok, the phone came in mint condition, it's an AAA phone, but one of the speakers didn't really work. Still, for the price?",Good
I bought this phone for my sister and it's fantastic.Great graphics and features and the picture quality double wow. She likes it.,Good
needed basic phone to replace basic flip. biger screen and text key board are selling point to me,Good
its cool I like it because I don't like her iPhone or somethingthat's why I'm just sooo samsung glaxy s4,Good
I would love to try out this phone once t is released for Tmobile. The phone needs to support the 1700 band. Unfortunately this version does not.,Good
"only thing i did not like at the time was that it tend to be slow and the picture quality from the camera was very poor.when i bought it in sept 2010 it was the phone i was waiting for, it is still work up to now. cause i did resell it to a relative who still uses it alot.",Good
"The phone is fully functional and isn't scratched on the front or anything, so it's perfect if you are looking for an HTC Incredible.That said, on the back cover of one of the phones (I bought 2) the shiny plastic ""HTC"" logo was missing the HT, so I pulled out the C and it looks like nothing is missing. One of the phones came with a wall adapter for the USB cable, and the other did not.As for the phone it's self, it is a bit outdated so some newer apps may not work, but it is quick and outright awesome. I would look up more thorough reviews if you aren't sure if an Incredible is right for you, but if it is, then this is definitely the one to buy.",Good
"I found this phone to be a sturdy, sleek, nice looking phone. I was swayed by the reviews on this phone, and most of them were right. I really like this phone. It is very thin but did not feel like it was cheaply made. What I didnt like, was the key pad is kind of awkward. Also, the power button is really hard to push. What really bummed me out was that this phone does not work with Verizon so unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it.",Good
"It is much faster than my XpressMusic 5800 and the screen is more responsive... I also like the additional keyboard as it feels similar to the N810 keyboard... the available apps function as expected and the Nokia maps are really nice (only the US maps will fit on the included 2GB card). It is very stable with the latest firmware update.The inclusion of a larger memory card would have enabled more downloaded Nokia maps as well as more applications and music, but 200USD for an unlocked phone of this calibre is already more than a competitive value...",Good
"1st smart phone , volume level to low. miss a lot of calls because of that. good luck seeing display when outside.",Good
"This phone has such a long battery life, I only plug it in once a week or so, and even then it still has about half its charge. Call clarity is excellent. The only reasons I didn't give 5 stars is it drives me crazy how many keystrokes it takes to do anything, and the keys are so tiny, in some light they are very hard to read and know what you are pressing.",Good
"Just learning to use a smart phone. So far have only used as a phone and not with the aps yet. The only disappointing aspect is the volume which to me, at 72, is poor to fair and on Maximum only half as loud as my former flip phone. My wife has hearing problems in one ear and can barely hear hers when it rings. Again, these are set on MAX volume. If I had known this weakness ahead of time I would NOT have purchased these phones.",Good
"Functional no nonsense phone is lightweight,as long as you dont need e-mail or internet it is just fine for the money",Good
The was exactely the way i wanted it to beit was arrived on time.The only thing that l were surprised of the way that the UPS had delivrered the phone.lt was left on a little table up front to the acces of everyone without making sure someone from my apptmt had received or signed for it.,Good
Great Phone. Loved the style and model. 100% value for the money.Issue:Am using T-mobile sim card and unable to update software version from 4.4.4 to lollipop version. Everyday when i try to update software it says you have the latest version and check back in 24 hours. Does any one have this same problem?I read this phone is up-gradable on the title but not in reality?ANY SUGGESTIONS ?,Good
"I ordered this device about three weeks ago, the shipment was right on schedule, it was received on time. I love the phone, much bigger than I imagined it would be. Lost one star due to there being a slight delay when scrolling up or down. Great camera though! I have enjoyed using the phone despite that, some of my Co workers have complimented me on the look of the phone.",Good
"Honestly , so happy with this purchase. Thought the size of the phone would bother me, but after using it for a while i just got used to it. Its such an amazing phone & it came right on the date it stated",Good
"Everything is great except for screen brightness. When compared to a full-size Z1 and the difference in screens was literally vivid, but it's still much better than the iPhone 4s it replaced. I would says it's the best ""not-absurdly-huge"" smartphone out there.",Good
"i bought it as a gift for my brother. Its such an awesome android baby. Speed is fast the phone performace is great too. and the camera quality is none less than Iphone 6. Love the pixels of the front camera if u r a selfie freak or spend more time on video chats.the phone came in with english instructions but after inserting the sim card and restarting it , it went back to some werid japneese or korean scripts.But i found one simple video on U tube on "" how to change the LG G4 settings back to english"" and brought it back to english script.everything else is good theonly reason i want to go with 4 stars is because of the battery issue. I doesnt last that long as well as the phone heats up all the time when use more than one hour or so .i am thinking of ordering one for me as well if the battery issuse gets resolved soon.",Good
"I am very happy about the capabilities and response of this cell phone. The only thing I wish it had was more memory, but what it has is adequate for my average use.",Good
I bought this as a first phone for my little sister (she's 11) as he might have an accident some day and would need to call for help. It's a good phone until it starts slowing down. It becomes super slow to the point where sometime the phone call lags out.,Good
"I bought this Blackberry 9220 Curve Smarsphone and shipped it overseas to my son as a gift. He said its a good phone, but wished it had a flash camera.I therefore, recomend this Blackberry Curve to anyone who is looking for a good inexpensive Smartphone without a flash camera.",Good
"Allows you to carry your tablet in confidence due to the indestructible design. The only draw back for me is a personal one. I carry mine into homes for presentations, and the profile isn't slim or sleek. Also, it's easier to flip back a leather cover than pop off a plastic lid, but as far as protection goes, it can't be beat.",Good
Great smart tablet at a good price. Bought it for an overseas trip so could not yet check its operation as a phone. It has one problem which might limit its use by many people. If you want to add a memory chip (or a SIM card) you need to pry open the cover with fingernails. I simply could not do it. With heroic efforts by me and my wife (requires more than 2 hands) we finally managed it. Whew!!!.,Good
I like. My. Phone. I even. Went. With. It. In. The water. To prove that. It's. Water. Resistance. I have. Been wanting. It for. a long time.,Good
"I did not appreciate the packaging that the phone came in, it looked halfway opened, and didn't say fragile anywhere on it. Would have appreciated more of an effort to keep my $400+ dollar investment safe! HOWEVER, quick delivery, (was left in my mailbox, which I both appreciated and though was strange as it said to leave at door) and I'm loving my new phone. Battery life is eh, I took the chance on it because the s7 is out of the question price wise, and I'm not disappointed, but the battery on my s5 active was MUCH better and lasted a lot longer. It definitely has an iPhone feel to it, definitely get a case, it's very ""thin"" my boyfriend described it as feeling fake. I'm pretty happy with the product and love the beautiful resolution and camera it has!",Good
"Heavy duty case I love it, but the screen protector leaves nickel sized bubbles I wish I could just take it off.",Good
I purchased this for my 14 yr old daughter. She loves it as it has much more to offer than her busted up iPhone 4.,Good
"I got this phone for my teenager son and he loves it! It's smaller than I was expecting, but for his small fingers it works great",Good
"Glass covers entire face of phone. Makes it hard to find a case, works great with otter box",Good
"I really like this phone. Battery life is excellent. I like the sleek design and color, I have the white one. The camera is adequate, could be better, but for the money what can you expect. The only issue I have with BLU phone's is that the earphone volume could be louder. I already returned two phones because of this. Overall I intend to keep this phone and the new Lollipop is a nice addition. Hope this review helps.",Good
"So far in 1 week- so good! But, this was made for the UK Version. Hope this does not create any problems!? And... it comes with Jellybean 4.2.2 - a good thing!! Most other Mega 5.8s do not have already installed recent OS updates!!",Good
This item was a great price and with free shipping!!! I recieved this item in time for christmas and it works great. Thank you seller.,Good
Screens a little small phone works great on Verizon prepaid would not get a contract phone again,Good
"I bought this phone couple of months back and till date I am extremely happy with it. It's a bit bulky but somehow I do not like the sleek ones. I do feel good about it's weight. It has a wonderful camera @1.3 MP with a slot for memory stick. A 8MB stick also comes with the original box. So if you are photo freak then you can consider a bigger stick. But for casual photography the stick is sufficient.Being a Nokia, there is no doubt about navigation and ease of use. The software is good and does most the task with ease. I did have some problem installing the software but when installed, there was no problem at all. I do use it only occasionally.Just a reminder for those people who try to compare this with PDAs....this is not a PDA...its a smart phone.With holux GPS receiver and software you can actually make this phone a full fledged navigation system with voice, if you want.",Good
"If you just want a ""smart"" type phone, and don't much care about having access to tons of apps,this'll do.",Good
"Got this for my 8 year old daughter for her birthday with a sim from AT&T gophone. Works good, she likes it, especially the fun color. My only complaint is that even when the volume is turned all the way up, it is still difficult to hear when you are talking on the phone with someone. Fine basic phone.",Good
"EL equipo funciona perfectamente no he tenido problemas con el, es rapido y facil de usar. El equipo trae el cargador pero para 220V y conexion de Australia y no trae los audifonos por lo que solo puedo cargarlo por el cable USB.",Good
This phone works great Iove the features and phone capabilities. Internet wifi access works great 90 percent of the time 3g memory space excellent for downloads. highly recommed phone.,Good
"Phone in wonderful condition. Charger packaged with it is incorrectly matched with this phone, likely from an old iPhone. As such, phone charges at a snail's pace. Save for this issue, it would be a 5 star purchase.",Good
"If you like blackberry, Torch is the best bb you can have. The metallic white frame around the screen will scratch easily.any way, I've the learned the hard way that Android is better.",Good
"This is an incredible phone for its price. Very well made unit, fast and gorgeous display. There's a few drawbacks: Android ICS out of the box, no user replaceable battery and no expansion card slot.",Good
This phone was exactly what I was looking for after my first one decided to go to the point of no return. It worked and did not have any scratches or anything on it. The only problem that I have had with it is now after a few months is that after a couple days I would have to power it down and back up because my volume setting for ringtones and alarms would decide to be on loud rather than on silent or vibrate as well as having to power it down every other day to every day because of its not wanting to sound my scheduled alarms but acted as if they were not even set at all. This is the only problem that I have had with it (which is minor). As long as it remains able to call and send texts that is all that really matters to me.,Good
"Amazing it only stick once because i guest it was new... but its just amazing, camera is awesome... I will definitely recommend this to anyone",Good
"This phone works greats and I have no complaints. I was with ATT and it got to expenseive. I use this phone for a no contract unlimited everything with Straight Talk. FABULOUS! I did have one problem though, I could not receive picture text messages. I could send anything in a text, I just could not receive a pic message. This was an issue with the provider, NOT the phone. However, I downloaded ""Hangouts"" app for text messageing and it worked perfectly. I love this phone. If you are looking for a phone that can help you manage your life with 1000's of apps, that is reasonably priced, this is it.",Good
"Where is a set of instructions for us 'older users' - you know those who did not grow up with txt messages. Love it, but wish there was a set of instructions (in larger print) for those like me.",Good
"IT WOULD HAVE TO SPIT OUT $20 BILLS TO RATE IT A 5 STAR. IT'S FASTER THAN MY MOTOROLA A855 AND DOESN'T FREEZE UP THEREFORE I DON'T HAVE TO REBOOT IT CONSTANTLY. VERY LITTLE I DON'T LIKE. I CAN'T BLAME MY FAT THUMBS FOR HITTING SOMETHING WHICH ACTIVATES SOMETHING ELSE, THEY DON'T SELL THUMB GUARDS. FOR THE TIME I'VE HAD IT, I SURE HOPE IT STAYS IN THIS CONDITION FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE YEARS. WE'LL SEE.",Good
This phone is easy to set up and easy to use.I'm not using all the apps. Just need to turn on what you need. Everything is easy to find on home screen.,Good
It's a nice phone but I am having problems with the camera. Every time I try to use it it says it is not working. Have to shut the phone down and restart in order to use the camera.,Good
It's really good other than the random lag and the battery drain is pretty bad,Good
You should really get this phone it is a great phone and the screen is very clean but the phone does have some sets back like you can barely hear your music in with your headphones and the phone only support 480p and the video quality is somewhat good,Good
working fine. It is totally surprise.. Never thought such kind of performance ... Only issues with low light picture..,Good
"I really like this phone. The screen is beautiful! The rear camera is excellent! The whole thing is very zippy.The downside is that average real use is only about 14-18 hours on a full charge. You MUST plug it in every night or it will be dead in the morning. If you had a particularly full day of cellular data use, I think the above numbers would be halved down to 7-9 hours.",Good
"good solid phone. good reception. good volume level. Would have liked it to look a bit nicer like the Verizon rugged phone...We ended up returning it (it was a gift and the person didn't like the ""feel"")",Good
"I'm using this blackberry in Colombia and it is working fine, at the beginning I had a problem with the speaker but I could solve it easily.3G is working fine and I upgrade to Blackberry v6.",Good
"I believe that the phone is in very good shape. It basically looks brand new. It came with everything besides headphones. One thing that i dislike is that the picture messaging didn't work, but apart from that, everything is fine.",Good
"Pros:Super lightGreat stereo speakershad the latest androidpicks up all t-Mobile bandsStylish design - sleek and beautifulCons:Camera is bad. Not good for high res photos like the more expensive phones.There is a dead pixel/white spot in my screen. I didn't want to get the phone replaced just because of that, so I live with that everyday. Not very noticeable thoughSome apps take a while to load, but work fine once loaded. Hey..you get only so much RAM for what you pay.",Good
"Did come GSM unlocked and brand new in the box untouched. Pretty sleek and clear picture taking quality. Im impressed.The back button seems to stick every now and then which is a bit annoying. The buttons do take time to get used to but the placement does come in handy and feels useful after awhile. Speaker volume is louder than a lot of phones!It does come with TMobile apps and such. But works fine with MetroPCS.It does overheat a bit but not hot enough to make holding it hurt, just slightly warm in my experience in the months so far.My phone use changes a lot, and I wish the battery lasted longer at times though but i do enjoy the phone a lot",Good
"I originally had a droid x , I love the size, the weight and feel of a droid. eventually I will step up to a 4g but for now I am happy with the functioning of this phone.",Good
"I had this phone for 2 months now. This phone is alright, Nothing special really...but I like it still... I have rooted my phone. Android is no where near the Iphone4, it lags when I play regular gaming not heavy duty games. I got the t-mobile plan $30. Lots of static & phone volume is a bit soft. I have had the Iphone4 before and now I have tryed this samsung exhibit 2 4g. Comparing the two... I would pick the Iphone4, But this android has cool business apps. It all depends on what your doing with your phone, $200 for the phone. Just be careful when u root you might encounter problems as for me I have had error text messages, it would not send or receive but there are ways around it so you can send & receive (download different text apps) be prepared for the worst!",Good
"So far I'm enjoying the phone. I had horrible experience with a previous unlocked Samsung phone that I was hopeful with this one. The camera is just ok. The pictures do come out a bit hazy. I am concerned that in the past week my texts stopped coming through. I turned off and reset and a whole slew of them came through. So now I'm restarting sporadically throughout the day. I'm going to see if I can contact the vender to see if there is a fix for this or a glitch. I would hate for this to be a sign of its downfall. I really need a working phone.~~~Product update.I have not had any further issues with missing texts. I think it was a glitch that I was not registered on a network at the time and so the texts did not come through. I realized this when I was playing with the settings and kept on the data button. Because there is no manual I was not sure what the function was, turns out I was turning off the internet options and with another selection had turned off texts. OOPPSS, user error. :)",Good
ok.. . ..... ... ... ... .. .... ... .. .... .. ..... .... ..... .... . ... ... ..ok,Good
The battery life is so good and long also the system runs apps really quick and never frezzes,Good
"I received this phone on yesterday, after reading the reviews thought of returning it, I open the box and love the phone. It was due an upgrade to Andriod gingerbread 2.3.6 fix and to rename the handset after upgrading the OS via KIES, the upgrade change the phone from Samsung Exhibit to Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G(it will be known as that in the future)it reminds me of a smaller version of the Samsung Vibrant with gingerbread. I have found nothing wrong with this phone so far. I am loving it so far. The music sounds good it has 5.1 surrond sounds only through the earphones. It has lot of memory, 4g speed works well for browsing. I upgrade the external memory to 16gig via sd card. The only thing I wish is that the screen was a 4.0 or higher but 3.7 ain't bad considering I was using a Nokia 1620. Great phone would have given five stars if not for Tmobile bloated software. I would recommend it to anyone at anytime.",Good
"It's good for the price. Don't expect too much out of it. As long as you understand that you are buying a cheaper, 3G phone then its great.",Good
"this LG cookie KP500 is my daughter 's favorite cell phone, she likes it so much. I like it too, it looks like iphone with enough function to use, but not expensive. only thing my daughter mention to me is when you move the touch screen it is slower then iphone.it is unlock, so you can use it everywhere.",Good
This was a gift for my son to replace a phone he dropped one too many times. He really likes it and it works well for him. The phone looked great out of the package and arrived in a timely manner.,Good
"I love my phone, the camera takes wonderfull photos. the battery whent dead after three months but I guess it's a BB's problem and not from the seller",Good
"I'm kinda old school when it comes to phones i.e. I mainly use them to text and make phone calls. I wanted a phone around the $100 mark, which isn't easy if you want something other than an obsolete flip phone. I use T-mobile and did not want to sign a 2 yr. agreement AND buy a data plan to get a fancy phone. The chart said this phone would not work on the 3G network; it does though. I like the features, especially the Free GPS Maps. It's doesn't have a 3plus inch screen and touch screen but it works fine. Keep in mind my last phone was a T-Mobile Dash and this one is identical in size. FYI. I did see a Nokia E5 with a 3 inch screen and touch screen for $30 more, but I had already bought this one. I'm happy with the phone.Oh yes, it has excellent battery life; I listened to about 8 hours of music on the phone and only used 1 of the 4 bars.",Good
"This was my second touchscreen phone, and overall it is a great phone. GPS is accurate if sometimes a bit slow. Signal reception is better than any phone I have tried(AT&T Wireless). Before now, Motorola RAZR's & RAZR2's gave me the best signal but this one blows them away. I mean full bars where others have 1 or 2. My only somewhat gripe is when texting it will misspell words. I type slow, and the correct letter expands indicating a hit, and a different letter enters in the text. Dunno if it is just a defect in this phone or a problem with the touchscreen software, but that's why 4 stars instead of 5.",Good
I really like the windows phone. It's very user friendly. My only complaint is that I live in a rural area and the signal is not received well. I had to buy a booster for it to work at all.,Good
This mobile has good functions and seems like Iphone 4S. LOL. The camera's effect is amazing. You can search free wifi by this mobile. Recommend it!,Good
"This phone is great.It functions well with my laptop,being windows 7 also is a plus.Simple to use,updated to 7.5 easily.Was already a Zune fan and this works well for my music also. Plenty of apps available. Overall,simplicity being the key.",Good
"It is working fine with venezuelan carrier Movistar. Although you must take into consideration that if you are purchasing it to use it with other carrier than at&t, you won't be able to update its software since all updates come from at&t.Best cam ever tried so far (rear and front). Sound speaker could be improved (comparing it with other devices).",Good
Descent phone. My mom likes it however she finds the size a bit obnoxious for A phone.,Good
"Although I love this phone...It lost a star for the poor battery it has. With my heavy usuage it dies after a few hours....lasting if I am lucky for 10 hours. Besides that, the interface is like no other. HTC really makes it easy to navigate and use. So I would simply recommend you get one of those power packs that can charge your phone anywhere!",Good
I bought this phone after seeing it by accident. I was a bit skeptical about its performance at first but so far the performance of the phone has been unbelievable. Its shoots great photos and doesn't freeze up like the previous model of Black Berry Curves.,Good
The guys at tmoble liked the phone. It works with ford sync. It is worth the money. I would buy again.,Good
This phone is perfect for me. The only problem is sometimes a blank message is sent when I start to reply to a text.,Good
"Pros:Arrived in a neat box with all its cables and acessories, and even had an extra wall adapter added. The phone and box were in perfect condition and I ran into no problems setting up and using the phone. The camera on the phone is beautiful. The phone itself is also beautiful and does not feel cheap.Cons:The OS, basically. Make sure you are willing to deal with buggy software and a lack of many different apps you would normally find on an Android or Apple device. But then again, if you are looking for a refreshing change, nothing beats the Metro style. No matter how limited and buggy the OS may be, no one can deny it's beautiful.",Good
"Let's start with the good things:1. Long battery life (the battery is 3000mA). With Galaxy S2, I had to carry to extra batteries. With LG D858, I needn't carry any spare batteries.2. Loud speaker. Really loud.Bad things:1. The camera pictures are over-softened. I've tried tweaking all settings and tried 3rd-party camera apps. The pictures still too bad to use.2. This is the D858HK (Hong Kong model). My device came with Android KitKat and would not update to the available Lollipop update. I've tried the phone over-the-air update and the LG support tool. It doesn't work. Some others report that they could update their phones using custom recovery. I'm not willing to go that path.I would buy it again.",Good
"Check what you need your phone for and then make your choice. For those with pure business needs (calls, SMS and emails) with some side chatting on BBM/WhatApp, the BlackBerry Classic is an excellent consolidation of the old and new. The keypad allows swift typing and OS10 has improved greatly with 10.3.One can finally feel something of significance in their hand when carrying the Classic, and it is not as bulky as presumed (you can keep it in your back pocket without fear of bending).I get my full day work done on the phone without any recharging during the day. From 8am to midnight, and I still have 30% or so remaining.",Good
I didnt have much time with it because I returned it but from what time I did have it was a very solid built phone and wish it worked with verizon. I read on multiple articles that it did and well.. it did up to an extent. I could make calls and send text messages but the data would go to roaming and only sometimes go to 4g. Bummer,Good
"I've had this phone for over a year. I am so addicted to a qwerty keyboard I hope I never have to switch. I mostly text, occasionally make calls. Texting is fast and easy. Love the touchscreen for browsing but for texting a physical keyboard is the only way to go. As for phone calls, they're clear enough for me. I originally intended to use Straightalk but they wouldn't support this phone so I had to go with AT&T.Cons: occasionally have issues with text messaging. Example: if I'm typing a message and back out of it then come back later, the message is frozen and I have to reboot the phone. I've had a few minor issues like this that have been fixed with software updates.Overall I think this is a great phone. Not fancy or impressive but very usable if you don't mind a simple phone. Screen is small but it doesn't bother me.",Good
This good phone but it is held back by a suspect battery and there is a high chance that some or most of your keys may stop working.,Good
"this is a really good basic phone. it is sturdy, speaker is great, sound volume is great...overall nice basic phone. but be careful buying b/c we bought two exact phone, one was defective and not working properly b/c whoever definitely tampered with it and did not inform us. we returned that phone. the other phone was sold by Brown Box Bonanza. the phone is used but worked great! BBB are fantastic with service! very prompt, kind and helpful! if you need used or new phones, i would definitely recommend buying from BBB.",Good
So far its a little slow that's why i'm not giving it a five star... but other than that i'm am pleased with it. It seams like a good phone and GREAT costumer service when i was having mailing trouble!,Good
"Great for basic vioce, text and basic webs. 13mb camera is a plus even though it cannot capture moving object very well. Some lagging on YouTube but not a big deal. One question I have is battery life. Most phones age so fast that no need to go with anything expensive. BLU life pure, with 2 GB RAM, is worth every penny. Highly recommend ed.",Good
"It was in great condition and worked great, but only for like 3 days then I lost service and couldn't connect back. They don't tell you it's a Verizon phone but it's not a big deal because verizon doesn't lock their phones. I have T-Mobile and for some reason it just stopped working and neither verizon or T-Mobile knew what to do, so I sent the phone back to get a refund. Still was in great condition and worked great but it might depend on your carrier.",Good
Android 4 features are amazing. Speed is good. But GPS does not work. The LCD back lighting is not even from one edge. You can see a few bright spots.Seller shipped the product very quick. It arrived in the US two days later but it took over 10 days from west coast to east coast and the first delivery was sent to wrong address.So far (2 weeks use) I like the phone very much. Hope it can last long.,Good
i really like the phone the dual sims are very nice slim sleek speakerphone could be a lil louder only thing i don't like it it diesnt remember devices it was connected to via bluetooth,Good
"Received unlocked Verizon phone that was easy to setup with prepaid T-Mobile SIM. Everything worked except T-Mobile WIFI calling which requires T-Mobile version of the phone. I needed this feature so had to return it. Too bad, I really liked the phone!",Good
"After 1 month with a ""smart"" phone these are a relief to have!! I just wanted a portable phone, not a computer! Love the phones AND the wife is ecstatic with them.",Good
"the only minus is that I thought it came with a charging cord, it was not specified that the charger pad does not come with a cord.",Good
"This is the international GSM version of the Motorola RAZR.In the U.S., Motorola entered into an exclusive arrangement whereby the RAZR line of phones can only be sold for use on Verizon's network, which uses CDMA technology. If you want to use the RAZR on AT&T, you're out of luck. Motorola did make a very similar phone available for AT&T. But, if you want the RAZR, you can buy this international GSM version and it will work on AT&T's network.I like the phone a lot, but I have two complaints. First, the range on the Wifi transmitter is very short compared to other Android phones. Second, the battery is not replaceable. When the battery wears out, the phone is disposable. I realize that Apple does the same thing with the iPhone, but I don't want an iPhone either. Ultimately, I returned this phone and bought a Samsung Galaxy S III instead.",Good
"no need to go on about the S III . The shipping, price and everything was really good. I was a little curious about the packaging of the phone for being brand new as the new one I got from ATT a year or so ago was packaged quite a bit nicer making one wonder is this phone really brand new? However it works great and shows no signs of prior use so as long as it ""keeps on ticking"" all is well.",Good
"The Blu Vivo 5 is a good budget phone which sports an impressive aluminum unibody housing, decent specs, and a vivid AMOLED dispay. The only area where this phone lacks is in its wireless connectivity.",Good
"Nice phone for the kids, simple to use and setup. Great for all of the texting they do, would recommend for the first time user moving up in phones.",Good
"I knew buying it that it was likely underpowered in comparison to the Samsung or iPhone5 - true. But it is a good phone overall. Came unlocked, setup was quick, the ability to add a second simcard is great for travel. So far no major issues with the phone.",Good
I bought this dual sim phone for my mother. It's just for calling purposes as she only knows how to make calls. The key pad is much bigger and clearer on this phone than on her previous one so she is quite happy. It works quite well for her.,Good
"Write your review hereit is user friendly, however, where can i take it for repair, as am out of america now, tjanls",Good
"This is a really nice phone for the price. It comes with a charger, a USB cable, head phones, a semi-transparent protective case that matches the phone color, and a screen protector. The protective case fits really well and feels great. The phone is very nicely made and works really well. The only reason I give it 4 stars is it does not support NFC, which is required for mobile payment apps, like Android Pay. Unfortunately the website does not mention this. This is a deal breaker for me and I'll be returning the phone, otherwise I would keep it. But I would still recommend this phone to anyone who does not need NFC support.",Good
Forget liking this device I Love It. The sound from the front facing stereo speakers are amazing. No need for separate Bluetooth speakers anymore. The 5.5in LCD screen is pretty amazing. I personally prefer amoled/oled screens but in comparison this screen holds it own. The camera is pretty basic but can produce some great shots in auto mode as well with manual controls. Very thin and light to the point that it feels like maybe the battery is missing or that this is a demo/dummy phone with no guts. Very durable though as tested by accident when the kids dropped the phone and it slid across the tiled kitchen floor on its screen and showed no signs of damage without screen protector applied or case on it. Do wish that the company included a clear case though. Usb type c and water resistant are on my wish list too.,Good
Grew phone. Ne issue to note is the 1067 model is 3G and will not support 4G LTE. No issue using with the T-mobile network. Good battery life will get me thru a day easily and two if light usage.,Good
"Pros: Very good smart phone. All the high quality games I have played work perfectly. The camera is amazing, and works sooo well in low light.Cons: Only one con has come up after my 3 months of using this phone and that is the camera. Once in a blue moon the camera will crash and the feed goes black. This occurred twice using the default camera settings not the 4k video recorder. The only way to fix the problem is to do a full reboot. After the camera crashes the phone's temperature rises dramatically.Other: By far, is the best smart phone in the market size to performance ratio. Easily competes with the iPhone 6.",Good
"For $40 (orig price $200), can't beat this for a starter smart phone watch. It isn't the galaxy gear or anything like that but if you are new to the smart watch arena as I am, this definitely does the trick for a noob. Its a nice looking watch and get compliments often of it. When in meetings, you can check and reply to text messages. Dial out. It holds a very good charge when it is not paired. I recommend it",Good
"Excellent phone - the S6 is definitely the best of the Galaxy line to date. Fast, high quality screen and camera, great touch, and feel. I would give it 4.5 stars - what are the cons?CONS:(a) (dual sim) you cannot associate a SIM with a contact/number - your only option is to have a box pop-up each time requesting which SIM to use for calling out.(b) Fingerprint authentication is iffy at times requiring you to enter your password(c) I'm definitely missing the ability to expand storage with an SD card - I'm already managing storage and its only been a couple months.",Good
"Really enjoying the phone. Its a head turner for sure and the clean operating system runs smooth most of the time. As a new company it seems Nexbit is working through some bugs and its more than I would tolerate with a more costly more well established brand, but I see what they are doing and I think this phone will get better and better as time goes.",Good
hello!! thanks for your questions. Yes i like de cell phone lg Nexus 5x and the others things.,Good
Looks good. Works good. Accessories are really bad. I'm using my old original USB to charge the phone. It shows a label with Verizon locked on the back of the phone. But it works fine for T-mobile. So far it's working fine. Let's see what happen,Good
This phone is good price and great screen. Actually after I bought Just Before HTC one X + released.Still I am so glad to have this phone.,Good
My nokia has made my life easier with my navigation and my link with friends on facebook.Thank you amazon.com for making this possible.,Good
"This is an excellent phone for a blackberry. Unfortunately, it cannot compete very well on features and other functionalities with other smart phone running Android and iOS. However, if your main concern is between email, BBM, good battery life, this is the phone for you... @ least before around the middle of 2010",Good
Great Phone for the price - It has a lot of bloat where but the running of the phone is perfect- playing games on this phone is great - I was not disappointed with this buy,Good
"Sony Xperia phones are great. Never bought an Apple, never thought following the crowd was the best way to go. Dollar to Dollar, Sony beats Apple. Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens. Plus, buildings and tress may ""bend"" a bit depending on your picture angle which is kinda like a cheaper point and shoot. But, then again, it's a very small lens and so you will get some grainy pictures as well regardless of the megapixels.",Good
Works awesome. The windows version takes little getting used too. I was expecting android version.Just wish Facebook app was better. Not sure Why I was sent the Windows version. The Windows App storestinks. They do not have near the same apps as Google Play or I tunes...... The Facebook app is very flaky.Phone itself has an awesome screen and great speakers. Just wish I could get better apps.,Good
"Cheap but good phone,works well overseas,fm radio works very well.Cheap enough to leave as a gift.",Good
"This phone is exactly what the seller said it would be, and at a great price.",Good
I like it very much but the issue was it was failing to connect to BIS here in Zambia.All in all I like it n I'm enjoying it.,Good
"It worked well. But the battery that i got with it ran down pretty fast. Bedsides that, it was worth it.",Good
"This is my first smart phone. All around, I think it's a good one, but I don't have anything to compare it to other than what I've seen on friends' phones.It's pretty sturdy. I bought a case and screen protectors for it. Since then, I've dropped it tons of times on tile floors and concrete driveways, and it hasn't broken. I'm pretty clumsy, so the biggest thing I worried about was getting a phone that wouldn't shatter to pieces when I dropped it.I was pretty upset, at first, with how they don't allow you to organize your photo gallery into custom albums, but since then, they came out with an update that fixed that.They also don't offer security to lock individual apps, so I downloaded AppLock for that.For gaming/apps, I haven't been disappointed with the performance. I play some games that use up a lot of RAM, but they still run smoothly.",Good
"Bought this for my wife to replace another BLU phone. As discussed in other reviews the phones have their quirks, random reboots, turning airplane mode on and off to get wifi and data connections to work again, but for the price they are a good alternative to phones that are 3 times the cost.",Good
The first phone sent to us didn't work but the company sent a new one FEDEX and it came the next day. So far so good. I hope this one continues to work properly. It is a good phone for my daughter.,Good
"one time when I charge it, it is over heat and power off.other it is works well. Over all it is OK, better then my iphone 3gs.",Good
Haven't used it yet but it arrived in a timely fashion and was sealed with all the correct parts and accessories....,Good
"Bought this phone for my father and so far he seems to like it. This is his first phone with a touch screen but he seems to like it as well as the slide out keyboard, the reason he wanted it, didn't like the T9 texting. Had it for a month now and seems to be working fine. Just remember this is a basic phone very limited on it's abilities.",Good
"It came in a bubble wrap lined envelope which was kind of odd since its a phone, i expected it to come in a box. Then the corners were beat up as if the product had been dropped, but it was a used product and thats to be expected. The battery is a little shaby and not to great but overall for 80 bucks it was a pretty good deal.",Good
Great phone for the price. Very fast in general. Protective case broke after first fall.,Good
"Bought this phone for my 12 Year Old Daughter. The phone arrived on time and was just as described. My only issue was that it is supposed to be a new phone, however, the charger was clearly used and did not work. Otherwise the phone is great.",Good
This person/company shipped the phone on time and I received it a day earlier than I was promised. The phone was in better condition than I thought it was described as and I have not had one bit of trouble with it. YES I AM A HAPPY AND SATISFIED CAMPER WITH THIS TRANSACTION.,Good
"this item i have both them, have receive them on time, and I was complete happy with the product in this case nothing to complain",Good
"I like my new phone, is not the best in the world but is usefull for what I need .",Good
"Good phone, there wasn't nothing wrong and I'm happy with my buy. It dint come with users manual but then again I did buy it used, however it did come with a website link for the users manual, not bad.",Good
"I like the product. I have 2 complains. First, the battery life is not as expected. Sometimes doesn't even last a day. The other one is that the camera could be much better. My old blackberry (javelin 8900) used to take better pictures than this one.",Good
One of the best phones out there.Minus a star because ATT sucks for locking the bootloader.,Good
"I purchased this telephone mainly because you can edit MS Word documents. I currently carry around the Palm Tungsten and my cell phone and wanted to lessen the weight in my handbag. I love this phone! I've had no problems with it, the keyboard is easy to use. I returned the Centro back to Palm because that keyboard was TOO small - must be meant for the very young.",Good
"The N73 it's a good cellphone , good camera, flash , but it's a quite bit slower than other N series cellphones , main menu appears very slow , and sometimes it need to be restarted to work fine. I was listening music when suddendly this phone hangs on and maintained a extrange sound , that action caused me to remove battery , wait 5 minutes and this N73 comes back to live again (maybe needs an Nokia firmware update)",Good
"My only gripe is that the phone didn't come in original packaging, otherwise I love my new expira play phone!",Good
"Rather large, but comfortable and it looks nice. Some features don't work, such as the browser, it's virtually impossible to type on the tiny screen & I can only access my own music when I'm connected to wifi? Overall, does give notifications, I can answer calls, but the sound the other person hears is not so good...a lot of breaking up, the headset that arrived with the watch was cheap and impossible to fit the hard plastic in my ear. All that being said, it was a good price and arrived early. Good for the price...hope this helps!",Good
"Really good touch phone, I definetly think its the best touch phone out there right next to the Iphone. The Speakers are Loud and Crisp for music. The Screen is responsive, and the vibration feedback, is not annoying at all!- The Camera could be better though, and the flash doesn't seem to help, alot of the time sadly-VERY IMPORTANT, the real reason why i didn't give this phone (that I was reaaally excited for) is because the second day I had it, I used the tv- out cable to see some vids, it FROZE and shut off, now SINCE then there is a horizontal line around the bottom of my screen, and it NEVER goes away :'[",Good
Nice phone at a great price. I actually use this as a GPS in my car. I don't use the phone function. Screen is nice and the GPS works great.,Good
"This is the best phone so far, everything about it is great. The quality of the videos and pictures are amazing. The only reason i don't rate five stars is because of the key board, its hard to space words because of it. Other than that its an amazing product and recomend it for those who want a good phone but cant afford those newer model, expensive phones.",Good
"Good basic phone for daily use, bought it as a gift for my grandmother since she needed a double sim phone.",Good
I got this phone because I want a simple phone for voice only and a long battery life. That is what I got. Battery life is excellent so far. Last over a week with reasonable voice usage. Hopefully the longevity of the battery charge will last a while. The rest of the features are crappy if compared to modern smart phone features of course.,Good
Got this for my son and he likes it so far. It comes with just a regular charger so you will absolutely need to purchase the fast charger.,Good
"Just received the phone, and there is no converter included for non-U.S. outlets, though it is pictured in the product information. Nor is there a packing list, either online or with the product. And (ironically) there seems to be no way to make a phone call to inquire, so let the buyer beware. If you are buying this for use abroad, get yourself a converter.",Good
This is a great phone. Love all the features. It does have to be charged nightly.,Good
Has a solid feel to it. I just replaced the rubber part of case since i didnt like the gray color on the hard plastic of case. I have dropped the phone several times and it has helped it a lot.,Good
My only real complaint is that electronics these days don't come with instruction books. I know you can go on line somewhere and find some sort of instructions. Usually I get my 10 year old grand daughter to explain it.,Good
"I bought the BlackBerry just because I never had one and was interested in getting my hands on the device. Two things I was disappointed in were poor Facebook and Twitter integration and slow Exchange syncing. The keyboard is pretty fine, yet the keys are a little bit tight to press. Maybe it's because I'm too used to typing on my iPhone.Overall, the Q5 is not a disappointment. For its $100 price tag, it does more than enough.",Good
I did send this phone as a gift to my fiance. She is happy with it's performance.,Good
"This was a replacement phone for my original one I got wet. I like this one as much as the first one. One odd quirk about it, the speaker sometimes comes on at the start of a call?? This happened on my first one also. I wait until the call connects, then ""slide"" the speaker ""off"" on the touch screen. Still haven't figured out why it comes on in the first place.",Good
"I bought this phone to replace one just like it that was lost. It has some features that my old 925 didn't have which I like. The screen did freeze after 4 days, but that resolved as soon as the battery died. Hasn't freezed since. The new features take some time getting used to, but I am navigating the phone fairly well now. My carrier is TMobile and the phone came preloaded with a bunch of ATT junk that I had to uninstall, but no serious issues.",Good
"Great phone, unique n slick... Nearly gave it a 5 star but it does heat up much quicker than any phone I have used in the past",Good
"the cellphone works excellent here in Ecuador. The only thing that I don't like, the cellphone has some extra app, that I cannot remove even i do many times and they come back.",Good
"It is a simplified flip phone with big buttons. It does not always cure old age, however. There are a couple of simpler-to-use geriatric phones out there. Outside display powers down so you cannot just look and see time, calls, etc., you must flip open to activate display. Call sound fidelity is good. Speaker phone mode sux. Very limited options.",Good
"I've only had this phone for 2 days, so I have no idea how well it will hold up in the long term. However, I really like this phone, but there is a catch. I was not expecting an Android OS to have the same layout as an Apple device. Every app shortcut is on the home screen, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. This phone also has more bloatware than BLUs other phones - for instance, you can't uninstall things like Google Play Books or Music, only disable them. It has significantly less bloatware than my last phone (an LG), but I was disappointed that they've added more because that was one of their biggest selling points to me. The phone runs very smoothly - the only issue that I've noticed is that it has trouble sending SMS messages when indoors, but this may vary from carrier to carrier (I have straight talk).",Good
"Nice build quality, recent (4.1) version of Android (most Android phones on Amazon seem to be running versions from 2 years ago), great screen, great price. Recommended.",Good
Came earlier than expected. Package was brand new and sealed.. Shiny and new. Great buy I just got it yesterday I hope I'm not speaking too soon,Good
Really nice I like the phone it actually served the purpose for which I bought it,Good
good phone to use and is good features user friendly nice looks easy to hold in hand is easy and to big,Good
"I had been looking for a BB that I would not have to pay a lot for. This phone is great. I almost returned itit because the battery would deplete just sitting on my desk. I decided to do a system upgrade first, it upgraded to BB 10.3. My battery life has been fine ever since. I have no complaints.",Good
The phone came right on time. It is a ver nice phone with nice features. I like how it flips open. It has a good size screen on the inside.,Good
This is a good smart phone. Must install Nokia camera for better picture. Sound quality of phone is poor although I use beats headphone,Good
"saludos ya me fue entregada como lo ofrecido . este Unlocked Samsung S5570 Galaxy Mini Touchscreen, Wi-Fi, 3G, Android... es exelente",Good
Its an iPhone 4. Nothing too special about it. I got mine fairly fast for where I live (the middle of a cornfield). Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller.,Good
Its are lovely phone bought it for my mom .think am going to buy one for myself.,Good
It was a nice phone. The only thing I personally dis not like was thw internet speed. U could only obtain up to regular 4G speeds.,Good
"it's not the top of the line model but gets the job done. I took it to Brazil and worked as expected without any issues. The camera is a bit slow and there's no flash, so night shots might be a challenge. No selfies allowed due to lack of front facing camera.",Good
This phone was for my niece. For the price this was a great buy. We did have issues with the mic at one point but teenagers are so tough on their devices to begin with. The phone is quick and stands up to brands like Samsung.,Good
"did exactly what I needed it to do, like make calls from Europe to USA and send texts. and the battery lasted almost two weeks!! takes some getting used to with the old school keypad, but overall I was pleased.",Good
I like how small it is. Now days phones are getting to big to put in your pocket. I work construction so a small phone is a must have.Issue i'm having is its slow. Freezes up on me.Camera quality isn't the best but isn't horrible.Overall for the price and size i'm content with the purchase.,Good
The phone is OK. Recently it has developed a hot spot on the screen. There is a slight discoloration near one of the edge.,Good
"Very fast shipping and excellent price for an unlocked S5. The only down side to this particular one is even though it is unlocked and is a T-Mobile device it does not come with the T-mobile ROM on it so you don't have the WiFi calling capabilities that you do with the T-Mobile Rom installed. Therefore making the statement in the add untrue. ""(This cell phones are fully compatible with T-Mobile.)"" This is not a deal breaker for me as I can root it and reload the ROM to the phone but would have been nice to know that prior to ordering it as it was for my wife and I didn't realize that this was lacking until she had already set it up.",Good
"For a basic phone, this is perfect. Doesn't require data, so the price is definitely right.",Good
Great condition for the price its super slow compared to the new iPhones but does the job,Good
"Everything was OK. I am using the phone in Argentina and works perfect. However, hostspot tool does not work for me.",Good
Nice android phone even though this is an old model the person I bought it for wasn't fussy about it they just wanted a new phone and they really like it even though they don't know how to use it properly,Good
It's a great phone so far .. I just don't think the speaker option when you are on phone call is loud enough ! That's all .. The rest is good enough,Good
"Todo muy bien, lo compre y una amiga me lo trajo a venezuela, solo tuve que ponerle mi chip digitel y listo!!!Everything cool I bring it to Venezuela and just insert my sim card and it's running perfect",Good
"Nice little phone with great features. Some issues connecting 4G LTE initially, but a couple of updates and reboots cleared those up. Overall, I'm happy with it.",Good
"Nice looking phone, very light due to plastic case, nice bright display, flimsy SIM card & SD card cover, all plastic so handle with caution or get a good case. Issues at start up due to software upgrade needed to get the touch screen to work ... this is solved by downloading the latest BB software onto your PC/Mac then connecting your Q5 and pressing the ""reload"" software button when prompted, then everything is good. Bought this for my Euro trips but decided to slot in my AT&T SIM card and all works well, just love the BB qwerty keyboard. Overall good value.",Good
"Great phone, looked better than expected. Only issue, seller failed to mention the home button was fixed so it doesn't work for touch i.d which I won't send back for but it's good to know when there's issues with product.",Good
"Great tablet, I use it mostly for taking hand written notes, reading books and playing games.I take one star because the included pen is crap, you have to buy the ""Galaxy Note Genuine Wacom Touch Pen 8pi Stylus"" to write comfortably.Also I bought it at discount price, $350 new, since it's a 2014 model I wouldn't pay more than that.",Good
ME PARECE UN BUEN TELEFONO PERO LA PANTALLA ES MUY PEQUEÌÔA PARA MIS DEDOS. LA PRESENTACION PESO Y TAMAÌÔO DEL TELEFONO SON UNA DE LAS MEJORES QUE HE VISTO PARA UN TELEFONO DE ANDROID 2.1,Good
"This is a good bang-for-the-buck phone. It has front camera, flash, 4G LTE etc. It is fairly water tolerant (used it while it was raining). It is light too. The battery lasts for a day easily with just phone calls and browsing. I only charge once in 2 days.One thing that I loved in it compared to Android phones is - it has terrific ringtones for alarms, phone calls and messages (that's more a comment on Windows 8 rather than the phone itself). The tile UI for organizing apps is also very nice.Windows does not have the same level of App coverage as iOS or Android. So, that is a pain. For example, Uber App on the phone barely works. Lyft does not even start. There is no support for GMail, voice navigation for maps, Google Voice.",Good
I bought one for myself and two days later my girl got one too. This phone is pretty darn good. I really like it.,Good
So far so good. I haven't had but 2 small problems with it but I am an electronics and computer wizard so I fixed it myself. Problem 1 was the youtube app and it has gotten better after I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. 2nd and last proiblem was the texting app built into the smartphone itself as it kept not sending messages I sent out to friends so I used messanger and wazapp texting for the solutions to this problem. I do not at all recommend downloading a bunch of apps and even more shunned is loading multiple same featured apps due to it locking up or crashing or worse is getting a virus so be wise to what you download as I give this same counsel to my clients who need my repair services. Nothing is more upsetting than a device getting damaged beyond repair from programs and misunderstood settings and you find out it wasn't covered under warrante and you have to spend the dreeded amount again,Good
Phone felt nice and looked nice - love the larger screen. Unfortunately I purchased this used and parts were missing so I had to return it. I can't comment on how it works since I did not get to the point of getting it up and running.,Good
Loud and deep bass. Treble is fair but mid is weak. But so far is the best for under $100. Really worth for money.,Good
"No issues with receiving my purchase. Looks almost new. Would probably purchase from again, if I am in need of another phone.",Good
"This item does what I need it to do (replace my old-man's crumbling flip-phone), and seemed like a good value. Worked on my existing Verizon Contract. The biggest hassle was getting the contacts *off* of the old phone, but that has nothing to do with this item.That said, I don't get how it is that Amazon continues to allow these clearly refurbished phones to be listed as NEW. I did not really expect that I was going to be getting a NEW phone, but it sure was listed that way. This is a 5+ year old phone, and I can't believe has been manufactured (brand-new-from-the-factory) in a long time. It would be unreasonable to expect a NEW phone, so why continue to list it as such?",Good
"Pretty good phone, storage space is very small, however. Processing speed starts to slow after a few months.",Good
"It is larger than I had expected but you get used to it. It is a little heavier than expected but it is a very solid feel to it. The battery life is shorter than expected but not a huge issue. The big screen is very easy on the eyes and the touch screen is very sensitive to the touch. The camera okay but has issues in low light, but any camera is only as good as the photographer using it. I'm as happy with my BLU as I was with my old Samsung. For the money, I will be replacing this BLU with another BLU when the time comes.",Good
i bought this phone to be used in India and it worked like a charm. Just inserted the regular sim and it was running,Good
"Reliable tough phone. Bought another for my wife, and she is happy with it too.",Good
"After trying a couple of mobile phones, I decided to go with the Samsung Exhibit 4G. I love it. It arrived in good time was easy to set up. unlike the other two I tried.",Good
"IT LOOKS NICE, NARROW, I HAVE A 32 MICRO SD CARD IN IT, DOWNLOADING APPS, FEATURES, CAMERA ALL WORK EXCELLENT. SOMETIMES IT STOPS SCROLLING DOWN WHEN I VISIT A SHOPPING PAGE WITH LOTS OF PICTURES (ONLINE) BECAUSE IT NEEDS UPDATES... I HAVE TO ARROW BACK TO THE PREVIOUS PAGE W/O A PROBLEM. THEN START ALL OVER. :-/ OTHER THAN THAT, ITS A GOOD PHONE.",Good
It works real good.just wish it could hold more memory in the phone.it takes real good pic and gets good msg,Good
"So far, this is a great little phone! Can't beat the price. The camera is not the best, but overall, it's a great low cost option!",Good
"I had bought this phone for my wife because she wanted to get one, she loved it.",Good
"After using it for six months here are my observations-* Excellent 3G and 2G network - This is not know to many. My partner has iphone6 and she always has network problem while Blackberry gives very good network speed. My partner uses my Blackberry's tethering feature to browse on iphone. I found this phone to fetch mails even in remote places where even 2G network is weak.* Excellent keyboardWorst part of this or any Blackberry phone is ""Very limited apps"".",Good
Very good Cel. I purchased for my son and he is very pleased with it.,Good
I love the phone but the reason that I don't give the five stars is because the seller never says that the phone has the at&t logo.,Good
"The product was in fantastic conditions, problem is that Iphone 3G is a lite bit ""old"" to support some Apps like Whatsapp. Not taking into account this, it is an excellent product, works perfectly.There was a miss delivery but was rapidly ammended and product was finally delivered to me.",Good
"Great phone! Very worth the money. However, mine was only compatible with T-mobile so I had to switch companies. But besides this, I truly do love this phone",Good
My first time to buy blackberry phone and feel In love with it. The best phone I ever had. I like the square shape screen which help me a lot in reading and composing easily.,Good
To be honest it is a lot more complicated than I thought it would be. I am 82 and will be taking lessons soon. It holds a charge better than the Mexican phones. My Mexican SIM card works. The sound is so much better. Has a GPS! It has everything.,Good
I liked the phone.Touch sensitivity is high.Good battery life.This Unlocked HTC piece is best offered phone for the price.,Good
I ordered 2 of these phones and they arrived a lot sooner than expected. The only problem was that one of them had the wrong charger with it but fortunately I had an extra charger that fit it. Both phones were in great condition and worked fine. Thank you!,Good
This replaced a cheapo Android that ended up croaking on its own. Holds a charge well and the OS is easy to use. Reminds me of the iOS. It is fairly light and one hand use is tricky and kind of risky also. 3gb ram is really 1.5gb but still I haven't had any problem with lag etc. Only complaint is no 3rd party accessories and I suggest keeping the Slim case on it. Mine did not come with a screen protector on it but had one in the packaging.,Good
Now this was a nice phone before the changing or system stop taking a charge. I sent it back a week ago to exchange for another one but the refund has not yet posted on my gift card account. I will order another soon as it does.,Good
A nice phone for talk and text and you don't need a data package. blah blaha lblha lblahblah blah blah,Good
"not a bad value .. however , it is slow and often freezes , needs to be rebooted more than the phones i have had previously",Good
This is a great product. The device is very slim and has a clear and modern style that I love. It works very well without any bugs. I highly recommend.,Good
"Why the phone is Made in China,not in Korea!?The phone is perfect,but I still think of words Made in China",Good
"As a complete novice, and on friend's recommendation I decided to chance it and take this phone. Nothing fancy, does what it says it will do, and most importantly it will work on my trip to Europe next year! It does come with main language being set as German, but that is easily fixable. I'd recommend getting this phone for everyone just starting in the smart phone phase.",Good
"I really like this phone, works and looks great. It's large but still fits in your pocket. Wish Huawei made it easier to unlock the bootloader for rooting though. I would recommend this to anyone who loves large phablets.",Good
The phone is excelent. The only problem i have is that the software comes with some app in chinesse and english. Thanks,Good
"Its has been a decent phone since I bought it. There are some quirks with the messaging app, like it will show a message in bold that has been read if the person is also in a multi-person message and responds; even when both messages have been read. The camera is not that great for photos or videos inside. Reception on T-Mo and ATT have been fine. WIFI and BT have worked without problems also. Definitely worth the pre-order price.",Good
Phone arrived quickly in good condition. Only reason I gave it a 4 star is the phone freezes from time to time and I have to remove the battery to unfreeze. I think this may be a Windows Phone issue and not a dealer issue though.,Good
works well for the phone and now my phone will last longer than a few hours,Good
Phone arrived quickly. Appears brand new. All accessories in box. Love the color. Works fine with AT&T SIM card. First time Blackberry user. Things are organized differently than previous phones so took a day or so to get used to it but love it now. Haven't found a calculator or place to type memos. These are pretty basic features found on entry level phones and frequently used so I dropped a star. Overall a beautiful phone.,Good
"Love it!!! THANKS SISSY, Brother says ""This one is just what I need.No need or time for any other fancy phone.""",Good
Very nice phone. Works well. It is very fast and it has an excellent camera. I have no complaints at all.,Good
"My only issue is the very small gap between the screen protector and the screen. It took a little time to learn how to touch the screen to get the result I want, but now it just seems normal.",Good
Phone storage is low I did not add an Apps thiis phone gie me the Blues,Good
"It is a good phone, a little confusing at first but is easy to use once you get the hang of it.",Good
This phone was just like the seller said. My husband likes only flip phones and this was perfect for him without a big price tag. Thank you.,Good
"Excellent phone. Nokia's best every, only wish for an external memory card and better battery life.",Good
Phone is good if you just need a phone with none of the bells and whistles...would recommend it to friends and family.,Good
The battery is no too long of 30 days but it is good to at least 3 or 4 days of work.I didn't check 30 days of stand by yet.,Good
I love it... I love that it has the keyboard I can just slide it up and still have the touch screen to hide it.,Good
"This phone is fairly easy to use and should continue to work great for phone calls, checking emails, and surfing the web.",Good
"Nice product with the good price. Bought this from Gotham's cells, and they provided with newer stuff (production date Feb 06 according to SN). So, I think less worrying from bootloop problem",Good
"me llego en el tiempo preciso solo que un poco despegado en la parte superior, y no trajo el auricular de blackberry lo demas todo excelente",Good
A lot of the apps don't work and the bluetooth doesn't show things on you car like song names. Needs some kind of update for apps. But great otherwise. Better deal than I phone.The camera is nice...,Good
"So far working great however one Phone has low storage straight from the begining after restoring my apps and the camera continually fails, however i have recently purchased a larger MicroSD card with hopes that with better storage the camera would stop failling",Good
Have a hard time activating phone because I have a Verizon carrier and normally their phone doesn't require sims cards.,Good
"The phone was in a great shape, no doubt, but it was said to be new but wasn't. I know this because the battery was not genuine and cannot hold a decent charge.",Good
"I wanted to ditch my smart phone and go back to the basics so i bought this phone. when i did my search on Amazon i entered ""At&t basic flip phone"" and there wasn't much selection, but some were posted as ""unlocked"" and can be used with any carrier. This one however was listed as an At&t phone which was not accurate, it's actually an unlocked T-Mobile Phone. The phone itself works great, and it's pretty much what i needed, but the listing is misleading and well, when i buy something online i need all the info on the product to be accurate. I want to know exactly what I'm getting for my hard earned money. Other than that, I'm back to the stone age with my Cell phone ha ha ha",Good
"I have used the phone now for about a month. I like the phone, screen size is great and everything seem to work as well as my last more expensephone. The only let down that I had was that I had no screen protector or protective in my box.Work great on the AT&T network.",Good
Very nice phone especially for the money. The only reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is the inability to pull the battery to reboot the phone. Although this males the phone safer it also makes it difficult to deal with if the phone freezes.,Good
"I love this phone model: it is efficient in size and battery and has the features I want in a basic phone. I ordered this one to replace my 3-year-old original that finally failed and have been generally pleased with its performance. On occasion, I have had to hard reboot it after freezing or other glitch (issues that did not occur with the original), but not major issues.",Good
I love this device...but it is not dual sim...was very disappointed as the site claims that it was...,Good
"I was a bit sceptical to sell my iPhone 6 to go back to Android but I am not regretting it a bit. This phone is just as elagent and sleek as the iPhone with waterproof rating. One initial disappointing feeling was this particular model doesn't support 4g on the At&t network but after battle testing it for a couple weeks I have found it is just as fast. It takes great pictures in and out of water with tons of cool editing and and customizing features. Battery life is unbelievable. Having had tons of phones over the past few years,this is the best so far. Keep it up Sony.",Good
"This was a much appreciated gift for someone who wanted to stay with a flip phone instead of switching to a new touch screen type of phone. The speaker works very well and is loud even in the car. There has been some difficulty transferring the contacts from the old phone. All in all, it looks and feels sturdy and well made and was ready to make and receive calls as soon as the SIM card was installed.",Good
"It's a fancy phone, multiple applications, easy to use, nice design and let me stay in touch with my friends an news trought social networks...",Good
Got this phone as a house phone for the kids to be able to run around with. Working great. Battery is still on first charge and pretty much still at 100 percent. Connected to T-Mobile in 10 minutes.,Good
"2nd time around and I love this phone! The first phone messed up after 3 days but the second one hasn't messed up at all, bluetekusa were very considerate and made sure I was satisfied!",Good
"Works great but battery gets overheated quickly, and hot! No scratches or cracks. Color was correct.",Good
"It works as advertized. Good size screen, excellent battery life, built-in radio, memory card for music playback and photos/videos. And all that for just $23 - pretty good deal.The only drawback is less-than-perfect navigation and keys controls. It is pretty easy to inadvertently turn off the phone when hanging up. But it is hard to complain given super-low price.",Good
amazon safe as alwaysthe only bad thing about this phone is the memory but the rest is finedont forget to get some extra memory,Good
"the phone work great and arrived early, a little disappointed about the duty charge i wasn't expected",Good
At first I was thought it was just a at&t phone. I placed my sim card and I got no signal. YOU HAVE TO RESET YOUR PHONE with your sim card attached. It will then read the sim card.Look at the top left hand corner of my screenshot. It shows simcards T-Mobile sign.Hope this helped.,Good
I consider it a very good product for audio technology that was implemented in the phone. especially phone storage spaceconsider putting on the 4 stars for the above,Good
"I recieved everything as expected. Product has a few more scatches than what I expected, but this is a great company to buy from. I would recommend this company to everyone I know.",Good
"my first smart phone (so nothing to really compare it to) it has been great for me so far, some issues with my network, but I don't believe it has anything to do with the phone itself.. great phone so far, I have no complaints...",Good
"The phone is very good. It has everything at this price point, except auto focus. Wish they had included it as well. Since there is no autofocus, forget taking close up snaps.",Good
"El telÌ©fono llego en buen estado y con todos sus accesorios, lo Ì¼nico es que no funciona el 3g con Digitel Venezuela, deberÌ_an colocar mas informaciÌ_n en cuanto a las bandas con las que operan.The phone arrived in good condition and with all accessories, only thing is it does not work on 3g with Digitel Venezuela, should put more information about the bands that operate.",Good
"Overall this is a good phone. Its my second of the ""knock off"" phones (my first was the Goophone i6 Plus which this phone is MUCH better than that one). It doesn't have a lot of space and the RAM clogs up pretty quickly but if you are ok with just a few apps then you will like this phone. It looks nice, has a good feel to it and in general is a very nice phone. I like it, so far...",Good
"Only gave it 4 stars but would most likely give it 5 if I wrote the review more than the few weeks I have had the phone. With 32GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM is more than enoughfor the price I paid which was $150 for this phone brand new. Only negative I found is that it runs on Android Kit-kat, hopefully they update it to Android.Lollipop. When this phone came out it was a $600+ phone without contract.",Good
"I bought this cell model 18 months ago. Seven months after purchase, been damaged. Nokia replaced it with a new one, without charging any fees. It is a great phone, I use it constantly to connect to the internet, GPS, phone calls, SMS ... The screen responds well to me, and software updates have improved over time. I doubt it replaced soon!",Good
I like it just as much or better than any Samsung phone that I have owned.,Good
"Like others the batery does not hold a charge long but that is a pantech for you also, Charged full last night and in three bars only had two this morning after turning it on, Works well as am an AT T customer and just put in my sim card and all works fine, Not sure how it will work if you are not an AT T customer but for me and the price I am happy with it, Just wish Pantech had better batteries, Wife has same problem with her Pantech,",Good
Came as advertised.Great 13.0 megapixel pic's and good video [could be better] but satisfied. Been using it with a Philippine Sim card [P40] peso.Performs as expected. When i get back to America i will install my contract sim card and not miss a call. Very good buy.,Good
"While the keyboard is a little small for my finger, the phone works very well. It has excellent battery life, good reception, andgenerally good and useful features.",Good
"The battery dies too easily, even with little use. But it has worked for me in Spain and in Ecuador. Cheap to get sim cards in those places and it works fine.",Good
"Its a good phone for the price! The screen clarity is astounding, the sound is good. It has a few glitches with the screen on like words showing up kinda distorted but is every so often and if you refresh it will fix itself. I get 4g with cricket wireless and I get my texts fast and calls don't seem to be affected, but I don't get LTE with it but with my HTC I didn't either so can't pin point to the phone. It is very fast and I love the camera it's a wonderful camera. Its not as customizable as my HTC was (as far as fonts and widgets) but if you root it I'm sure that could change. It is a very nice looking phone it is comparable in size to the Samsung note 4 but I can still fit in my pocket.",Good
It was okey buy still frost while using it..its only good for your handsfree calls for bluthooth,Good
Mobile Image was helpful in making sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I found them to be reliable and will do business with them again when the need arises. It was a pleasant experience.,Good
"It has been slowing down greatly as more and more updates are put on it. I think between the amazon app and facebook, it's going to have to be done soon",Good
"Am giving it a 4 star because it came on time and as a brand new but has a bad battery. I had to buy another battery but generally, I love the phone.",Good
THANKS for timely send. The phone was in good shape and we are happy with the sale. Have a great week.,Good
"its a good phone for its purpose, it has an excellent keyboard, the battery life isnt bad as long as you arent running a thousand things, and the screen quality is good for its age, in my opinion the web browser is a little slower, but really its not unbearably slow it works decently quick, of course you also have to consider how well sprints signal is in your area, but with this phone you are going to end up spending more each month for a phone service thats not as capable as a newer android phone (which you can find cheaper now in some instances) i do like the shape and feel of the phone its built well, i think the track ball is cool its like a mouse in the web browser, i have heard of people having trouble with the track ball, my track ball has worked well, they do have replacement track ball kits available that are easy to install, all in all its a nice little phone",Good
I got this phone for my 12 year old daughter whose phone broke and I did not want to pay 200 for a deductible for a new one. I will just list pros and cons to make it easierPros:does not look cheapdecent sizecan get multiple apps as long as u get additional storageCamera is ok for the priceVery stylishCons:Opening it is an hassleHow to insert the sim card gets on my nerves and was confusinglack of directions gives you a headacheoverall for $50.00 the phone is definitely worth it. Now this is for my 12 year old. I would not buy the phone for myself unless I was on an extreme budget and needed something and I am 30. I asked my daughter for the review and she says that she loves it and is happy that I got it. I would definitely recommend buying a case and additional storage.,Good
"The product is a hybrid version of phone with 3G and touch and type is cool. I had bought it to gift someone.Cool if its your first 3G and touch phone.. If you are used to Smartphone.. (I use HTC smartphone..), then you will not like the product. Nokia OS is lagging behind and needs to pick up to a large extent.Overall this is a nice budget product",Good
This is my first BLU smartphone and I have to say I'm very plesed with it's functionality uptill now. I had a nokia C6-00 but this android phone does so many things I forgot I once had an Nokia phone. It's easy to operate and to mention very fast. The seller did also good; the package arrived in a good condition and at the proposed time. The camera is not first class but it does the job it's intended to. But overall it's a great phone.,Good
"Like everyone else says the camera isn't great. Putting in the SIM CARD and all was pretty simple to do. Only problem I have it was settings not staying like my installed keyboard not working occasionally and it doesn't seem to read things from my memory card well. I think that's not really related to phone itself so hopefully, a new one will fix that.",Good
27/10/2016I received my phone today and there's two little things that I didn't really liked1) it came with a bump in one of the sides2) the headphones don't work in the phone if it's in is case.,Good
"I bought this phone for a week, I want to be with her for three years.Design is beautiful, sounds is very good, screen is good, smooth runs APP.Indoor camera is soso...",Good
Nokia C2-01 is really a good phone...its very cheap and features good in all aspects...working with all GSM carriers....cute and simple phone,Good
I think the keyboard is great. The camara is ok but not as good as I thought. And apps are very limited and poor.,Good
"I wanted something that would run off the CDMA network. Otherwise it's good, but not for me..",Good
I love this phone great quality. One thing I'm not so sure about is the gigabytes it only came with 3 when it was suppose to be 8 but I can deal with that.,Good
"Great entry-level basic Smartphone. You can keep your life simple with this phone. I said ""basic"", don't expect more.",Good
The only thing I would advise you to be considerate of when purchasing this item is that you cannot use the Touch ID function due to the rubber covering the home button,Good
"At first the phone got super hot and battery drained in less than 4 hours. It was either an update or me changing the network to ""2G only"" that helped to solve the problem and now the phone lasts easily for a day.",Good
Great phone with one major problem. If one doesn't set the daily reboot feature it will lock up and act crazy. Touchscreen will not function correctly and sometimes requires battery removal to reboot.,Good
"Very good phone.love the sleek design to the camera quality.However, the battery drains out too quickly.",Good
The phone performs fine and I can install any apps I choose so far.The 1 draw back I've noticed is that it gets quite warm after prolonged use.The camera rear camera takes decent quality pictures at least for what I would use it for. The front camera is a bit grainy it seems but really that doesn't bother me.I upgraded from an old Droid phone so it performs well and above my previous version. The price was the selling point for me I did a lot of reviews against other phones using different sites and the specs vs the price really held up and so far the performance does too.,Good
"pretty solid smart phone for a reasonable price. Activated easily with TracFone using TracFone's GSM Unlocked SIM card. Has Dual SIM slots, so you can use 2 different numbers on the same phone. Have to remove the back to insert or remove micro SD (storage) card (not included). Pretty fast phone for web use and good wi fi range. Comes with some pre-loaded apps, including amazon and google. Decent battery life for light use, and charges fully within a couple of hours. Built in camera is just okay, but fun to play with, and has flash on front and rear. Screen is easy to view and images are clear and crisp.",Good
"Nice one, Yet works good, was asking activation required but there is no problem just type ##000000 and press OK after in the first field erase number and type 1111111111 then push MENU button and save. That's it.Blackberry came with home charger (looks new), USB cable, and CD all in the box with no IMEI on it.Battery works prefect.Phone overall like new.",Good
It's an awesome phone but does not get 4g with T-mobile. . . I like the SwiftKey option.,Good
Unit arrived on time. The accessories are complete with original Nokia box. Unit looked very new. Take note there is no Chinese language supoorted by the phone.,Good
This phone is value for money.unlocked phone in this price is quiet good.Lot of features in the phone.good for travellers.,Good
"Hi,I bought this mobile phone almost one year back. Its works good still now. I didnt face any pbm with is mobile.But If i open lot of application which is connecting net, the application closed by itself and says ""Not Enough"" memory. Apart from that the voice converstion and reliablitly and battery charge are very good.This mobile is good for those people who needs for voice converstion and partial browsing.Thanks",Good
"For the most part this phone works fine except it doesn't hold a charge that long and needs to be plugged in frequently. Also, the person who sold never took his name off it so when my daughter calls his name pops up and AT&T had to do some work to switch it over to her. This is my teenage daughters first phone and she is happy with it.",Good
"Love this phone. Needs charging probably because I am learning with it much. Has nice camera with flash, calendar, browser, contacts, clock, pictures, can't email yet, BB world not featuring apps, (server?). Four and a half stars, good value.",Good
"Nice Slick and small with most options. Like it, Has fm radio, camera, 5 MP camera, push email and good to use worldwide",Good
I just wanna make sure if my purchase is done because I have a new credit card. And I have to leave to my country soon.,Good
Front microphone stopped working within the first week so I have to put all my calls on speaker phone.,Good
its a heavy duty phone and water resistant with a 10hr battery life that i love it . it has a flashlight and a very loud external speaker which is plenty loud while I'm driving driving which i love also love .its has no camera i don't care and its built to take abuse and lasts a long time .my old phones in year looks like they went threw a tornado so this takes more punishment with no problem and that's what i needed the basics with roughed and tough and best of all it was very cheap .,Good
"I really like this phone because it really fills all my expectations, the only thing i did not like is that mine has the at&t and that it does not bring earphone besides that i am really happy with this phone.",Good
"Good phone, maybe a little bit too big for me but very very nice looking. It perfectly works with T-Mobile LTE",Good
"Bought this as an upgrade for one of my kids from a feature phone to ease them into the smart phone realm without breaking the bank. He's a very diligent kid so I'm sure he'll take care of it but if not replacing it won't be too expensive. This is not the latest and greatest, but a kid doesn't need the latest and greatest in their first smart phone IMHO. It has decent battery life, the screen is nice and as a phone it works great. I'm a repeat Blu customer, and the only real criticism I have is lack of updates and the more recent models I've bought have had apps locked on them. I was able to overcome it by installing the Google Now launcher, but locked apps are never good.",Good
"Great outfit to buy from but it was not unlocked, did not update properly, did not connect to Surface RT or HP laptop (running Linux on that) properly and seemed to accept Microsoft apps only. Had to return.",Good
"after a few months, my daughter dropped her 5c and it broke. she said it was less than a foot, but then, this is the plastic case version...Anyway, i'm writing to say how pleased i am with nu2u, bc i took the phone to apple store, and after a 15-minute ""component verification"" the phone passed. truly their lable of ""brand new, in the box, full apple warranty"" was TRUE.Thanks Nu2u!",Good
"Great phone, but the 4G band doesn't work well in my neighbourhood. I don't know if it's a problem with the company in my country, or a problem with the phone. It connects to the 4G band in other places and towns but not here where I live. What is curious is that my sister's phone does connect to the 4G and it runs well. So, my Blu Pure XL should be able to do it, too.",Good
"I'll start of by saying that this is one of the most beautiful phones I've ever seen! The curved bezel looks VERY nice. The gold version is really sleek.The battery life is awesome. You can use this HARD all day and not have to charge it till you go to sleep. I'm talking YouTube videos, playing games, and browsing the internet.On the downside though, the cameras are VERY lacking.(But isn't that to be expected with a budget phone?) It's also a tad slow. Still useable, but if you use it next to say an iPhone or a galaxy, you will really notice it. So if this was an $800 phone,I'd be disappointed. But for the price, it's an excellent phone! Call clarity is good, the screen is very nice, Bluetooth works flawlessly, wifi connection is great, gps works very well too.If you can't afford a $800 phone, this is a great option for you!! I highly recommend this phone!",Good
Good solid case. Has 3 layers of protection. The only thing is I really don't like the texture of the back side. It's this weird no grip texture.,Good

AUN ASI RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR. CON CUATRO ESTRELLAS",Good
I am not a fan of Verizon service but it is what I really didn't have a choice as to how many used phones I could choose. I do like the size of the phone and it does offer some pretty good benefits for the phone. I did get the phone in a decent time as stated for the delivery,Good
"This phone so far has been a good mix between value, design and performance. I can only hope that Alcatel continues building a budget/ performance friendly phone for the Android OS.",Good
"I love my iPhone even though I have not been able to use it. I've always loved iPhone and was waiting patiently to get one. Also bought the SIM cutter and cut my Digicel Sim, however it does not work with the iphone. I called APPLE and they said a cut SIM will NOT work, I'll HAVE TO get a micro sim, as the connections are different. FOR THIS, APPLE LOSES 1 STAR because now I have to wait another day and spend some money with another network to get a micro sim in order to use my phone - Boo!Until then, it's back to my faithful iTouch.. BTW, my cut sim is back in my Nokia and working fine, so it wasn't damaged during the cut. Learn from my misinformation and don't waste ur $ on aåÊMicro SIM Cutter, Converter with 2 SIM adaptersåÊUNTIL you verify a cut SIM will work with the SIM provider and others on the network.One-day shipping was great. Got all my items securely packaged and intact. Thanks Amazon.",Good
"Power button can be a bit wiggly but this is a good windows phone. No 8.1 update or Cortana, but this phone is a good buy.",Good
"Definitely great for its price, especially since it's an unlocked phone. Never heard of FIGO but thought I'd try it out.Speed - the biggest downside. A bit slow when booting up, starting up apps, and navigating throughout.Battery life - only like 8-10 hours before I have to charge again.Mobile tethering - thank god this phone can tether and do hot spots no problem. My previous HTC One M7 couldn't do it without rooting.Resolution - pretty decent interface, takes decent photos/videos overall.Data - automatically turns off when I'm using WiFi so I can't receive MMS while on WiFi.Phone case - it's flimsy so I don't imagine much protection if I drop the phone. It is nice protection from the rain, and you can use it as a stand while watching Netflix which is a plus.If you're on a budget and want a solid, unlocked smartphone, this is a must buy.",Good
It is a very nice phone. The texting capabilities are very good. It comes without a sim card.The price is very good.,Good
It's a good little phone for the price. We use it as a replacement phone for kids. Works great and is cost effective. It's not a smartphone ... but for texting and calls its great!,Good
ITS V E R Y N I C E CELL PHONE I L I K E D . . T HANKS,Good
"I bought this phone as a gift for my friend who lives overseas. The phone arrived promptly and it was in a mint condition. I couldn't figure out how to charge it (connecting the charger just wouldn't do anything) and thus turn it on. But after googling the subject and playing with different variations of reset, and taking out the battery a few times, it started charging fine. (This problem never popped up again and I am still not sure what exactly was the reason for not charging in the first place).I personally like the Android OS much better (I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and also have used the S2 for quite a few days) but I still prefer to stick with the iPhone (as far as smartphone). It takes better pictures and feels more solid overall. (Whereas the Galaxy S2 is very lite and made of cheap plastic).",Good
"was presented as being ""NEW"". product arrived earlier than expected, but it was obvious upon inspection that it was NOT NEW!!!. For the price paid, i'm more forgiving of the lie told in the ad. I had no problem turning on the unit and sinking it to my network after placing my Sim card in the phone. I fully charged the phone and it has been two days and I still have 60% battery remaining. My only real complaint at this time is that the seller thought it was necessary to list it as new,when it is obviously refurbished. oh yeah!! and the charger that came with the phone was not a Motorola charger and got real hot. I happened to have an Motorola charger that worked better and didn't leave me in fear of burning down my house.",Good
It's OK. THe surface is very new. The speed and the baterry is Ok. I could not get its charge,Good
I liked the phone but without T9 texting i couldn't use it with T9 this phone would have been amazing.. i liked the feel so much i ordered the Blu with a full keyboard and hopefully that will work better for me.. so if you never text or text every once in awhile this phone is great but if you text like everyone now a days its not the phone for you.,Good
"For the first couple months the phone worked great. It came in the condition advertised and in a very timely manner. However, we've been using it a little over 2 months and have issues with it charging for the 5 weeks; it is getting to the point you have to sit and hold the charger in the slot or the phone won't charge. Did not have this issue with the previous phone, same model.",Good
Received the phone on time and it works fine. Would have preferred that it was in an Xperia box instead of a random Sony Ericsson box with Ericsson instructions. I am satisfied with my purchase.,Good
"This is a beautiful and amazingly ergonomic phone. the swipe function is so smooth. Works great with T-mobile's network. That means works well with Solavei too. The noise cancellation, ever present clock face, clear clear display, beautifully flowing functions and the smooth shape are all pluses. The battery is nothing to boast about. I do active battery management - and it lasts a full day at the most. The one thing I miss sorely is Google maps. though there are workarounds, none of them are smooth. There is the inbuilt nokia drive system- which works even without internet. But the search is not as robust as google maps/",Good
"overall i really like the case (this is my first otterbox). It does make the phone heavier, but I don't necessarily see that as a downfall for me. It makes plugging the phone into the charger a little more challenging, but again, not bad enough for me to give this a less then 4 stars review.",Good
The phone is very nice and holds a charge well. I don't like that the keyboard is different from my other phone. The other one was so much easier to type on.,Good
"Phone arrived on time and was as mentioned (factory unlocked).Although, the start up screen featured a maxican telecom provider logo, I am not bothered by it.all in all a good deal.",Good
Nice phone. Hold the games that I play and more. Still trying to figure out how to save music to the Samsung Galaxy Prime.,Good
"Never used android before - seems quite fun! Got it for $300 though it still feels a bit too much for this..It's alright overall but there are things that i really didn't like about the device:- battery drains too quickly- fingerprint sensor on the back is far less convenient than on the front like iPhone- on-screen buttons eat space, i'd prefer physical/sensor- the dynamic sounds like total crap- camera has 0 stabilization so it's hard to get a steady shot especially on video- 16gb is effectively only 10gb which is just not enough for normal use- the size is too big for onehanded use - very inconvenient- call sound quality seems a bit poor..Gonna keep it for a while probably, but as soon as iPhone 7 comes out gonna switch definitely.",Good
"its good, i like it its not bad, i encourage you to check it out. I'm sure you will like it",Good
"Our old phone was dying so I got this one to replace it and so far it have been very good. It is smaller than the old one so lighter to carry, etc and the sound is good. We can't see to text so don't have that service so don't know how it would be for that.",Good
I had a phone like this one before and it works just fine. I was happy with the price also.,Good
"Love my LG3 I had the LG2 phone previously and also loved it. With some reviews posted there was consern of back controls, but I love the fact they are at my finger tip. The only problem I have with G3 is the SIMS slot. You have to take back off phone to get to it, with the G2 the SIMS slot was on the side of the phone all I had to do was pop it out and drop in SIMS card, for me that was more practical; that way u never came in contact with SIMS prongs there was no way of damaging the prongs, other than that I would have given it a 5-star. Also the battery life is not great.",Good
"Fast Shipping, Clip is tough to clip phone, bought it to use till my warranty replacement come in. New clip is much easier, not sure what this one is so hard.",Good
"Came with a weird screen but everything was functioning properly. I bought it used, so it was better than expected.",Good
"This phone is awesome, bottom line. The battery lasts a full day with moderate use, the processor is fast, the camera and camera features are great, and it is a beautiful phone. There are tons of reviews online that go over how great this phone is. My main criticism is the apparent lack of quality control. The first HTC One I received could not take pictures without them being blurry. It turned out to be a hardware issue. There was also static when I plugged int a headset due to a loose connection. I had to return the phone and received a new one. The new one's camera works as it should an the headphones do not have a loose connection or static when listening to music or on a phone call. On my new phone, the volume rocker sticks out slightly. The differences between the two phones I had highlights some quality control issues in the manufacturing process of this phone. Overall I definitely recommend the phone, but beware of the issues I have had.",Good
"i got this phone for $144 from CellDepot, it says i saved $500 _Ù÷¦. Definitely worth 600 bucks exept on amazon it said perfect condition.....not in perfect condition. it came with a few scratches on the screen and the microphone for calling does not work.BUT....everything else works perfectly so there goes a star because its not in perfect condition.congrats...",Good
It's was boy a bad phone at all I just like gold and they didn't have the right charger,Good
Package came fast and works fine it exactly as described. I honestly thought for the price I get ripped off but I did not.,Good
Delivery of the product was on time and got the phone that is mentioned in the description. No complaints!!!,Good
"My item came as fast as usual and was delivered in perfect shape. Good phone, very good phone...but, this old lady is having a hard time getting to know all the features. I'm getting there and thank goodness I have adult kids that can lead me!",Good
"Bought this for my dad. The phone smaller than I expected, and the keypad lock is tough for him to operate. The phone seems well built though, and the battery lasts for weeks.",Good
Love the watch but the sound quality is terrible. Even when volume is turned up its still extremely low. Other than that no problems.,Good
"This is an excellent phone and MP3 player. The camera operates better than the average cell phone. I have had problems at call termination with the phone locking up which has required me to remove the battery as a solution. As a touch phone, the 5800 is as good as any of the others that I have seen.",Good
My wife used this phone while we traveled in Germany and worked like a charm with a local SIM and carrier. It was nice to have a smart phone for navigation as we walked around. She is used to a actual keyboard but thought that the virtual keyboard on this was easy to use and a nice size.,Good
"I reviewed this phone several times before purchasing and I already knew Samsungs reputation on stellar cell phones yet was still was sketical on a prepaid phone. Wow! was I wrong! This phone does all that my contract phone does and a bit more for lower the price. (I purchased this phone for my wife by the way)With the right plan you get 4G speeds,depending your area and all that android has to offer.I highly recommend this phone for anyone looking to ditch contract prices.I'm about to purchased,if not this phone but another prepaid for my son.Kuddos out to Samsung though.",Good
"The phone was packaged nicely when I got it and works like it should, except when I plug in my headphones. I have to spin the plug sometimes in order to get sound at the same time from each ear plug. Thats why I give 4 stars instead of 5.",Good
"Much faster than my S3 mini and the screen is much larger, which is very helpful for viewing the Waze gps app while driving. Features are similar to the S3 mini. The speakerphone feature is useless because the microphones (both bottom and top) are very muffled and people on the other side can barely hear me. I tested this thoroughly by calling my landline and leaving myself messages using speakerphone and normal mode. For some reason when you switch to speakerphone the mic's turn to crap.",Good
"This is my first smartphone purchase, so I decided not to pay full retail for a brand new phone. I am overseas most of the time and need an unlocked phone. I bought from seller BREED, and the phone arrived without delay as described: in an original box, looking like new, and truly unlocked. Using the phone is pretty intuitive and HTC's quick help prompts can be set to reappear if I want to see them more than once. I downloaded the manual and am now going through it to learn all the phone's capabilities. Photo image quality with the camera is very nice. By managing my connectivity services and on-time of the display screen, I have no complaints about the battery life so far. I keep a charger in the car as well as at home, so recharging really is not an issue. No complaints!",Good
I am an older person Windows only to date Nice Phone Graphics Learning Curve Etc.,Good
"I bought it because it's a double Sim phone. The camera is fine, and the network reception is quite good Compared to my former phone.",Good
I needed a wireless travel emergency phone and also a smartphone to operate my Canon point and shoot camera remotely.It does both and very well and I'm happy with the purchase!,Good
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,Good
"It is a nice piece of technology, puts the smartphones to shame. Just wish it was Bluetooth headset inabled.",Good
Been very pleased with this phone until the latest ASUS update which nudged it up to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Very unhappy with the product since the update. Very much unlikely to do another ASUS as a result.***Ok...I adjusted a few settings and tried the new power boost app and I'm happy with the phone again. I turn off wireless and Bluetooth when not using them so battery life while not excellent is fine for me. It's actually a nice phone...cameras are excellent.,Good
"Excellent phone at a good price. I can tell it doesn't have the power of my SGS6, but it works perfect for a travel phone.",Good
I've purchased several of these because it has been the best basic phone I've ever owned.,Good
this phone has everything. the only problem I have is that it's just too bulky,Good
"I've had this phone for about 3 months now. Works great, and shipped that day and was delivered the next day! The only complaint I have is that the battery dies super quick, even without games and videos. I probably get about a couple hours of usage. But then again I did order a used-like new. Other than that I would recommend this phone.",Good
"The case is made really well but the ""screen protector"" thats attached to it makes texting next to impossible! Definitely needs to be improved.",Good
"Truly the phone is unlocked for companies in Guatemala, for a phone with Android system fulfills the expectations but one drawback was with the charger, the adapter does not work, of very poor quality and do not bring headphones or micro SD memory also are negatives for the seller because the description of the package if included in the purchase.",Good
"First thing i did was throw that sucker in my sink, if it failed the test i would've returned it, but i still got it. Does its job as a phone with phone calls and texts, multitasking and browser speeds show the phones lesser side on speed, but for the $35 it was definitely worth it. U get what u pay for no?",Good
I ordered this phone to replace the identical one I bought 3 years ago. The port went bad on my last one but I liked using this phone and its features so I ordered another one. Set up was easy and it covers the bases well for a no-contract phone.,Good
The phone came in record time and was in good condition. The problem I had was that the phone didn't come with an owners manuel. Luckily the phone is pretty user friendly so I was able to figure most things out on my own.,Good
"I bought this Phone for my son, and he loves it. Great Phone at a great price! Happy with purchase!The only thing we didn't like is it didn't come with an SM card.",Good
A good inexpensive phone. Works great out of the country while on vacation. Good phone to have for emergencies.,Good
this phone in pink is sooooo pretty! but it is easy to get some ash in the screen :(,Good
"While I like the phone, features, quality pics, look, I bought this phone unlocked and am unable to activate mobile network sharing to make the phone a mobile hotspot",Good
"Received it today It is simple and seems good enough as a backup phone I'll post in a couple of years to see how it withstood the power of time!Update #1: one week after purchase, the phone has a pretty bad sound quality people hear me badly and I hear them badly also, this is only a backup phone and only costs 20 bucks but if call quality is the most important aspect on a backup phone for you you should look elsewhere. The battery life is insane though and that's mainly what I wanted so I'm not docking any more stars.",Good
"Pros: Good looking phone and high quality in every aspect. I was using Nokia N97 Mini and it was too small when I surfed the web then Amazon has this E7 on sale for $359, I took my chance and bought it right away. There are some kind of inventory shortage of Nokia E7 on Amazon since the price jumped up to $430 couple weeks ago. The Nokia E7 has similar functions as my N97 Mini except bigger screen. I like it very much.Cons: Battery seems running out more than my N97 mini, I have to charge it every night. Sometime it is frozen for a while when I have several applications opened at once. Other than that, it is a great looking phone and everybody keeps asking what kind of phone do I have. Can't wait until Nokia releases Belle.",Good
Phone works great for what I need. I do not use data and this is a good size phone. Arrived very fast company has great service.,Good
Seller delivered as promised.did not receive original earphones and charging adapter.mobile looks new and working good.,Good
"Great phone if you do not want to spend so much money on a Samsung galaxy, however although the camera is 13MP, the quality of the pictures are still not as good as the Samsung Galaxy phone.",Good
"Shipment arrived on time. So far, the best phone I've owned. Takes some effort to locate and update the device firmware.",Good
THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT DEAL AND WELL WORTH THE VALUE. I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GETTING CONNECTED WITH T-MOBILE MY SERVICE PROVIDER AND I AM JUST LOVING THIS PHONE I NOW WISH I BROUGHT THE IPHONE 5,Good
Overall it's a pretty decent case. My only complaint is that it is loose around the power button and volume rocker. Besides that it's comfortable to hold and has a good looking design,Good
"used this for a year it worked well, but would lag at times maybe due to small RAM.",Good
"good phone, no ear buds or adapter for sd card ?? that came with my first new Infuse, POORLY packaged by shipper came in a bag, no padding and bag was tore lucky the phone was ok",Good
"Everything my son expected , he loves loves it..It was in great condition..No problems so far..",Good
"So far, I'm very pleased with the phone. I just wished it wasn't sooo unconfortable to unblock the phone (something you do a zillion times per day)- by pressing a super tiny button on the side of the phone. I guess once that little button breaks, I'll be screwed...",Good
"A wonderful phone to have . Easy to use and quite sleek. My only drawback is the delicate nature of the screen. My 3 yr old knocked the phone off the counter and the screen,even though not shattered or cracked was of no more use to me.",Good
"I have been in the market for a phone for awhile, and I didn't want just any other popular phone. I researched and found that the Sony Xperia has one of the best cell phone cameras out there and it uses the Android system. Not only that, it allows you to customize the functions on the phone such as the white balance of the home screen. I love it. The only Cons are the terrible battery life and the phone didn't come with headphones. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase.",Good
Incredible screen (image and touch response). The camera is the best of ithe pack. It would be a five star if it had Portuguese language.,Good
I must say i was surprised to some extent to see that exactly what i had ordered did come all of the features listed sis come and the Nokia c-300 was in working condition and all it required was a valid sim card. i even got other accessories it is a splendid product. The Nokia C-300 was also delivered promptly and that is a previlage. Thank You,Good
"I purchased this phone for a trip to Aruba. Put my ATT SIM card in one slot and then picked up a local prepaid SIM card from airport in Aruba and was good to go for the week.I didn't have to worry about salt or sand getting into the phone while on the beach. It was dropped a few times and never missed a beat. I could text and make calls from it for cheap rates while being reachable by those who had my personal number in the event of emergency without having to keep track of two phones.Be prepared, a screwdriver is required for SIM installation (a dime will work in a pinch) and iPhone users will need a SIM card adapter. Also note, the instructions are in Japanese so the average American will have to figure everything out on his/her own. It's not complicated, but not clear either",Good
"This phone works just fine for someone who just needs a phone. I got the 750 minute plan and I have loads of minutes to burn through, so I tried using the browser. It wasn't as slow as the other reviews led me to believe it would be. It worked ok, but it is a little clunky and difficult to navigate. I'll only use it in emergency situations. I haven't tried the 411 service yet, but I suspect that will be faster than using the internet. The sound and the ringer are both good. The keyboard works well for me, but the buttons are too small for my husband to use. The battery life is excellent. Good phone for the money.",Good
I wish I had bought this sooner...a little bummed that I can't pick my own tone for message allerts but over all its a great phone,Good
"Amazing phone for the price. It's got everything the average smart phone user wants and pretty sleek as well. The only limitation is its 1GHZ processor, which means your limited in the number of apps you can run concurrently. However, methinks BLU Wil sure improve on this by the next Life View release. Being a frequent traveler and based in Nigeria, the dual SIM nailed it for me.",Good
"Good phone for one who does not need smart phoneEasy to use..some memory, text, ring tone features",Good
It works good but it goes slow sometimes but its a very good phone I love it,Good
Great phone for the price. No issues. Works great. Fast as I need it to be.,Good
Mine is not connecting to straight talk. Not reading the sim. I don't know what is wrong? Any advice? Thank you,Good
This product was exactly the way I expected it to be... It was not for myself I purchase it but my said that she was very excited when she got.,Good
"I love this phone, though there are some MAJOR setbacks if one wants it for straighttalk. The picture messaging system does not work, although there is a way around it it is SO troublesome and it took me a month to get everything working correctly, but once it's working the phone is amazing and I have no complaints except a lack of a front facing camera.",Good
"Pros:Unique designSnappy performanceSuper cheap (at least for now)Fingerprint reader on the power buttonDecent size screen (5.2) I thought it would feel tiny after using my Nexus 6, but it's not too bad and easier to hold lolCon:Robins UI - you need to use a third party launcher if you want an app drawer and change the look of your iconsThe battery could be better, but it does have quick charging so it's not too bad.",Good
"Absolute fantastic dual SIM phone. Had some issues initially switching data between SIMs. I had to insert SIM 1 first and accept/install update fomr provider, then remove and insert SIM 2 in the second slot to receive and install update from second provider. That did the trick.Only downside is that voice quality is bad if doing WiFi download at the same time as talking.Else a great phone.",Good
"I brought this phone for my husband because of his big hands, but it's still bigger than expected. So far the phone has been working great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is there are no cases, besides the one that comes with, and even that one seems small, but other than that we love it!",Good
"I've had the Blu Energy X for two weeks now. I have to say it's not the best Blu phone I have had, but it's got its perks.Pros:~Good battery. Not the best (I miss my Studio Energy, wanted the Studio Energy 2 but out of my budget) but it gets me from sunup to sundown.~Android 5.1. Amazing. Great features.~Seems to me that I can store more apps on my SD card versus other Android phones I've owned.Cons:~VERY glitchy. I've had to restart the phone several times because apps would crash and not open.~It took about seven times to download certain apps.~1 GB RAM is really not enough to run everything I want.~Phone is slow to call. I hit call button and it takes several seconds to show that it made the call. Also the phone rings for 5-8 seconds before the screen pops up to let me answer.I'll be keeping this phone, but as soon as I can I'll be getting the Studio Energy 2.",Good
"Love this phone. It's the right color and it did came unlocked, wich i was kind of worried because of some people's comments. The only bad thing its that the charger adapter came in in the uk version and in my country (Venezuela) we can't use it, that's why i gave it 4 stars.",Good
"I love this device. The UI is very clean and can be customized with widgets. This phone is not a beast in terms of processing power, but it does what I need it to do which is phone calls and light mobile gaming. The screen is huge definitely making it a phablet which some people might not want, but I wanted a large screen so that I could use it for school notes and reading power points and the like without having to carry around both a phone and a tablet. My only qualm is that the screen resolution is 720p, but honestly it's not that noticeable, and for 300$ I'm not going to complain.",Good
"Well this is a sony ericcson so the quality is what you expected plus the symbian 9 works great, I only had problems connecting to a Bluethooth GPS, and there arent enough 3erd party applications like in more popular phones, It is a Smartphone that coneccts to blackberry and does all what the description saids but I had two problems, one is that the phone is a quad band but it does not work in the 850 band that youll find in some countries, it does support 3G and Video TV. The other is that the unlocked version they sell is for Hong kong and it comes with 2 languages, chinnese and english I try to download more languages but in SE site there isnt support to the latest firmware version it came. So I dont have spanish letters recognition. Anyway I like all the features and the use of wifi is great no more internet overcharges!",Good
its a very nice phone at a very nice pricewhy pay more just for a name?,Good
The phone overall is great but it didn't come with a American charger and the earphones one of the earbuds is longer than the other.,Good
This E6 rocks. I owned an E71x so my learning curve was short. I didn't want to sign a new contract so I went unlocked--my first time. The experience has been great. the only problem I have is that the flash washes out up close subjects.,Good
Its a good phone but its home button is a little bit hard to press.,Good
"Very easy to activate and I can take it to other carriers if I choose to do so. I simply went to Verizon and they gave me a sim card at no cost. After inserting the card and logging into my google account all my contacts and apps automatically transferred. There were about 3 updates of the operating system which took several hours to finish installing, and used a big chunk of data. So far so good.",Good
"Initial Thoughts:When they say it's thin, trust me its amazingly thin and light.Screen is gorgeous to be only a 720p display I love it.Snappy and crispy animations.I will report back on battery life!!!",Good
"excellent phone, it is easy to use, fast, the menu is well laid out but it seems a bit fragile. I do not regret buying it",Good
I PURCHASED THE PHONE FOR MY BOYFRIEND. HE LIKES THE PHONE HE JUST WISHES THE BATTERY STAYED CHARGED LONGER. HE HAS TO CHARGE IT EVERYDAY OR ELSE IT GOES DEAD.,Good
The phone is great. It did not come with a cord to charge it nor memory card. I was not clear that these were not to be included.,Good
Phone is great if you are considering an upgrade to a smart phone. I used it with the T-mobile network.Screen is responsive and the Google integration is good. I was able to get on my home wi-fi; gmail and it also connected to picassa for photos. You do have the QWERT keyboard option - you need to change it in the keypad settings. Picture quality is fine and i was able to stream youtube videos with no issue. It does have Navigation application but does not work.,Good
"Having new phone regrets. Found that while the OS is upgradeable, the battery is not replaceable/removable. Also setup and transfer with AT&T contacts was a nightmare.",Good
We brought this for my grandpa and he loved it because he's old aged. It worked with his vision wonderfully. It's easy to use. But not for kids.,Good
"I prefer the lumia 950 XL materials, but the phone its ok. Works very well and you can use almost two day with the battery.",Good
