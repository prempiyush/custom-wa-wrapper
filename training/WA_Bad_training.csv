"The phone itself looks and seems to work fairly well, but while the Q&A answers from the seller claim that it will work with T-Mobile 4Gm so we ordered it. Official word from T-Mobile:THIS PHONE WILL NOT WORK ON T-MOBILE USA 4G BANDS.The phone is nice enough, just make sure that your carrier supports the bands as shown in the technical specifications.",Bad
It heats up a lot. The battery life is terrible. Last about 3 hours until I have to recharge. The charging stuff it came with sucks too. Doesn't charge the phone at all. Had to buy another charger.,Bad
Shipping was excellent and it looked good but the phone wouldn't power on so I returned it .,Bad
"The phone work normal, but the firmware is for China Only, not Worldwide. It is CN model, not ROW. I try to use it in Russia, but it does not work with 3G and LTE.",Bad
"Buttons stick and can't get memory card to work, it freezes up alot and never stays charged and runs slow",Bad
"I'm sure it's a good case, however, false advertisement. Does not fit 5th generation ipod, as advertised.",Bad
"Two thirds of the time, I can't get signal at home or on the road. Granted I live in a rural area but there are towers up and down I-5 and I don't get reception most of the time.",Bad
"The phone itself is very nice, but I got a refurbished version, when it CLEARLY STATED it was a new phone! Also, the charger was not for US.",Bad
Protects the phone very well but muffled the sound out of the speakers. It is hard to hear the person on the other end of the phone call. Also prevents from talking on speaker phone because there is an echo.,Bad
"Pretty powerful phone for the price. The volume buttons and power button are right under the camera lens, which means the lens is smeared all the time. Not ideal. Having the power button on the back also makes it harder to lock the screen if it is laying on a table. I don't want to have to pick up the phone, I would prefer to be able to discreetly lock it by pressing a button on the site and never have to pick up the phone. This has less me to fumbling and dropping the phone on occasion. Completely awkward placement. I am not a fan. In fact, the location of the buttons is so awful it just ruins the whole thing, they are completely inaccessible when you need them.It is also disappointing that the LG keyboard doesn't seem to have a speech to text button but I liked that it did have a dedicated number row. Switching to the Android keyboard gets you the speech to text button but you lose the dedicated number row and pretty much every punctuation shortcut except for the comma and period. I just can't win!",Bad
The phone is very light and easy to use. The battery however dies way too fast. I could have a full charge i send three texts and its down halfway. The back of the phone never really closes so it pops off easily. The camera is ok but takes too long to work by the time it clicks my kids have already moved. I wouldnt get this phone again if i could go back. Nothing special at all.,Bad
The PHONE is CRAP THE BATTERY IS DEAD AND DOES NOT CHARGE I have it for about 2 weeks.Before it completely died It would take VERY LONG TO CHARGE NOW THAT THE BATTERY IS COMPLETLY DEAD IT DOES NOT CHARGE AT ALL A WAIST OF MY MONEY AM SO MAD !,Bad
"Very few directions came with it and they were very poorly translated from Chinese to English. I was forced to return it. Too bad, it seemed like a nice little phone.",Bad
"The call quality is terrible, something between fade and tin can. Camera is ok, but image quality well below my previous phones, a Moto G and an LG. Most frustrating of all, after a month, the first time I dropped the phone the screen shattered and that was with an outer casing accessory. The only redeeming quality was the compact size.",Bad
"For a ""super camera"" phone the camera is not very super. I have steady hands and the picture would still be a little blurry! And the video quality is sluggish and very blurry.",Bad
"Seriously, I dont recommend this phone. . . the only good thing is its looks. its all show and no go. . . I bought it because i broke my old phone (nokia 5300) but this phone was so bad i decided to go back to my broke phone.. which I now fixed. This phone also has horrible functionality as far as mp3 players go. the speed of navigation is horrible because of horrible layout and the fact that the processing capabilities are horrible(waayyyyy too slow)Im giving it two starts one for the sleek look, and one for the 2mp camera, which you can still find on ALOT of other phones.",Bad
"I Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special edition 128 GbReally 5 stars.Beautiful design, good package, 2 covers in the box, 128 gb of internal storage.From the box - 1.8 Gb from 4 Gb of memory used - I thought it might be less.--------------4 months later. Update from 5 sars to 2After buying a couple of weeks, the problems started with the fall-out from the network. Sticks have, 3g-4g Net working, but I can not be reached - the subscriber is unavailable for a caller. And I can not call - just silence and hang dial screen (or receive a call). Support 2 months promised an update, the updates came out, but the situation did not improve. And this type of VIP service :(3 months after the purchase of faulty screen. The phone does not fall, does not dive.",Bad
"I noticed 2 hairline fractures about a week ago , then yesterday it fully cracked so the only thing holding everything together is the screw. I've only had this for 5 weeks",Bad
"Good phone, looks, feel and works fine, but has many bugs. I'm waiting for a firmware that can fix all.",Bad
I was very happy with the phone until the last firmware update. Thanks to other reviewers I found information on how to correct the problem. I am still going to return the phone to Amazon.It makes you wonder about their quality control systems if they let a major bug like this slip through. As far as I am concerned the consumer should not have to go through such extensive steps to resolve the issue in the first place.Maybe I should have bought an iPhone....,Bad
"I purchased this phone after I dropped and cracked the screen of my Samsung3 (still had 6 months remaining until I could upgrade). This phone was a huge disappointment. It was very slow, dropped calls often, and did not hold a charge very well. I ended up going back to my broken phone until my upgrade became available. The only good thing about it was its compact size.",Bad
Product shipped on time and arrived as promised. It was brand new as advertised. BUT I ended up returning the product because the wifi would not work. Not sure who's fault this is. Googleing this problem I learnt that a lot (but clearly not all) S4 have this problem . I think it is a software problem but I was not able to resolve it using all the suggestions that I found on the android forums etc. I did everything from pulling the battery to doing a factory reset (actually did several of those). In the end I just could not spend any more time on this problem and returned it. The return process was painless and quick. I gave them a 2 because I think this was a software problem and the product might work fine for someone else with a different network/setup. BTW I am on ATT in US>,Bad
The phone it self is really slow the front camera sucks it takes horrible pictures & it freezes up fast,Bad
"even though my 32g sd card is set as default I can only download apps by rebooting the watch/phone, a window opens to say no storage space, also will pair with other devices but will not connect even when you say ""OK"" in the trusted device window. my carrier T-Moble tried to regester the divice on my account but the IME number come's back as invalid. I really wanted this divice, think I was to first to have one in my area. I don't want to send it back, but I have no choice the seller customer service has not responded to my outreach.",Bad
"The operating system, features and aesthetics of this phone are just fine, but the only way I can call, send a text or get a call is if I have almost full service. If it has just half service or less it will not do anything. This is very frustrating, considering I rarely have absolute full service. I would not buy this phone again even if it was half the price!",Bad
"I have been a fan of apple products for a while, mostly because of the stability of the OS. I decided, when my iPhone ran out of space (16gb) that it was time to make the switch. I purchased the M7 and liked it, for about two months.Pros:-Awesome camera-Great videos-Freedom that comes with Google Play (vs iPhone Apps)-Great sound-Also, coming from this seller, it comes with a screen protector and a protector on the back as wellCons:-Constant overheating-Apps lag-Sometimes the GPS apps don't work-Phone mutes microphone while talking (on it's own)-Phone hangs up on people while talking (on it's own)-Phone enables speaker phone while talking (on it's own)-Phone does not connect well to blue-tooth in vehicles-Phone's music set-up is confusing. Some saves to google play, some to the phone itself.-Constantly have to release ram and terminate apps.-Takes several seconds to send a text message.After about two months, I decided to switch back to iPhone. I'm markedly happier now, although your milage may vary.",Bad
Should have mentioned that it was an Arabic and Hebrew language model.Not as useful to me as it could have been then...,Bad
"the nokia used to be one of the best mobile devices, now with the iphone and samsung, there no way u could use the stupid deivcei bought for 10 days and i sold immeditly .. its stupid mobile ..and i will not buy it again even if its made in finland",Bad
I was taking back that the phone doesn't use a regular Sim but a nano Sim which had to be inserted in the side of the phone that was a deal breaker for me cause I had gotten the phone for a family member overseas,Bad
"LAST MONTH I BOUGHT:Blackberry Curve 3G 9300 Unlocked GSM SmartPhone with 2 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - International Version - Graphite GreySold by: Jiaming PanTHIS BLACKBERRY HAS A PROBLEM. WHEN YOU WRITE A MESSAGE, EVERY LETTER YOU PUSH, THE CELL PHONE WRITES 3 OR 4 TIMES THE LETTER.HOW CAN I DO TO FIX IT? I PUT THE KEYBOARD VERY SLOW, BUT THE BLACKBERRY DOESN'T IMPROVE THIS SITUATION.TOO BAD!",Bad
Is not user friendly and shuts off on it's on. Will be replacing as soon as I am able,Bad
"It's a great phone but after almost a year, the screen just stopped functioning correctly. Like if I tap certain spots in the screen, it won't read the taps, it is kind of frustrating",Bad
"bought a unlocked phone,the phone i received was locked to verizon had to pay $20 dollars to have it unlocked.",Bad
There is distortion in the soundThe head set dose not workThe photo messages don't downloadedSometime ringing and sometimes does not ringing without any Chang in setting,Bad
"Order came on time. Phone was set to Chinese. Manual also only in Chinese. No way to figure out what and how to use it. Was lucky to have neighbor who knows Chinese.Phone gives me only 3G on T-Mobile, and has very limited options comparing to Lumia 925, for example no at glance option no WI FI calling.",Bad
Bought this in December it now will not charge so had to buy another one.,Bad
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",Bad
"I had to return it because, for whaever reason, can not be ported in for use.",Bad
It was mentioned in one of the Q&A that it is a dual sim.But its not.But other country sim cards work after the mandatory 6 min call from usa sim card.,Bad
"IMHO, this is one of the best Nokia phones ever made, except it's made in China. Which sadly limits the longevity of this product. Let's face it, China makes crap. It's very sad that Nokia products are no longer made in Finland where product quality was as important as design. So it's a disposable phone that has a lot of great features and innovations.",Bad
"I knew this phone would be small, but it is so small a child's fingers can barely push the buttons. Not to mention it did not work well at all.",Bad
"I bought this phone claiming that it was ""new"" in the full description, and as I had a gut feeling which I should have listened to, the phone came in with lots of cosmetic wear and light yet noticeable scratches on the glass screen. However, the internals worked fine.",Bad
"This phone is not accepting the 3G/4G network in the US, only works in 2G mode. Worse thing is, there is no option in the phone to enforce it to use the 3G/4G network.",Bad
"The phone specs are great. If you are coming from Samsung or even a Sony Xperia then the UI will need a small degree of learning curve.Pros:Great specs for the price, especially 4gb ramNo bloatwareCons:Battery fully charged barely lasts 24 hoursUI needs some learning curve on the user's partBy far the biggest drawback - Speaker output is horrible and can be best described as low energy and anemicI ended up returning mine due to the battery and low speaker output. Otherwise, the phone for the price is a bargain.",Bad
The phone cannot be upgraded to the newest version of Android and has an Operating System from AT&T.,Bad
"This phone has a great camera, nice screen and overall function. However, you can barely use it because it has terrible battery power. It loses charge almost at the rate of 1% per minute just for using it for internet browsing and/or phone talk/text. The battery wont even last for the full day. I have to charge it atleast twice during the day!",Bad
"The phone looked great and worked great but then the outside speaker stopped working at almost one month ,this is twice with this company i got a phone or one of my kids and it stopped working at a month. offered to refund but could not exchange phone. Trying to still find replacement again.",Bad
Came with battery that won't charge. Needed to order a new one in order for phone to work.,Bad
Didn't like it because the phone itself is too small and so are the icons...sadly had to send it back.,Bad
this phone freezes a lot of time. sometimes it is hard to power the phone. shut off for no apparent reason. although i like the phone i am contemplating to return it.,Bad
"Did not perform as expected. Low quality display. I would stick with the lumia products as this one needs much improvement to even come close. Not to mention you can get one almost as cheap (i.e. 520, 530, and 640)",Bad
"Bought it. followed every direction. Verified it would wok with my phone service. Set it all up, got a nano-sim card from my service provider. Called customer service to have put on line. After 2 days of trying, I find out the phone is not unlocked. Amazon is the distributor. Have not figured out next plan of action. If I have to eat it I will spend eternity taking action. I spent months searching, researching, learning about phones. It's what they don't tell you that messes up your day. We don't really have a choice of being in the computer / web / phone world. No body really know WTF works with what. they say it does, but, they have not tested it. All theoretic BS. Its not the phone, its those lying about its functionality. I have never been vindictive in my life. I will not let this go. Have had enough. I have all the documentation. Wonder what courts can do for misrepresentation.",Bad
"The internal antennae is all jacked up. I had to send it in to be repaired. Luckily I was under warranty. I had problems calling and texting where my friends with the same carrier had perfect service. Also, the side metal looking part was bent. I didn't notice that until later, but it's not covered in warranty.",Bad
"It's a good cell, unlocked, but it's refurbished, the charger is not from Nokia, and doesn't have any earphones, I'm quite disappointed, they should say this this before you pay it as if it were new.",Bad
Just got this phone today and already will be returning it. Yes the build quality is great. But the power button for my phone atleast is a bit stiff and will only turn on the screen if i click on the left side. Also loved the screen but the physical touch buttons were unresponsive at times. The ui is really laggy too. and for a long time android user i dont even think i could get used to it. A major complaint is that if i was sending text messages after a certain amount it would just say messaging is sending too many messages (paraphrasing). it was just bad. also with the themes. if you are going to have themes be consistent with the icons. i downloaded several apps and it was just their normal play store icon. not even a color background like it does for some.,Bad
Don't ever buy a phone off Amazon they'll rip you off. When you receive the item it will not work properly it's going to have some flaw. Also they buy the phones from AT&T and sell them for their own price. When the phones come from AT&T their locked and can not be used by many carriers,Bad
"Let me start by saying this, the UI on the Robin is one of the best I have ever used. It was polished and simple and beautiful. For the price, you're getting pretty good specs. However,there are two main issues that I had with this phone. One, the battery life is horrendous. Sitting in my pocket. With very very light messaging. It went from 100% to 60% in a matter of 3 hours. On top of that. The speaker sound is pretty bad. They crackle and all you can hear is static through them. The bottom speaker has a distinct crackling sound that is just awful. I tried to live this phone, I think they solved the storage issue quite nicely and elegantly. I just couldn't ignore these glaring isdued.",Bad
"I really liked this phone but ended up returning it because I was unable to figure out how to change the default language from Chinese to English. Making the switch using the drop-down menu only changed the language of a few of the menu items and apps. All the rest, including the default language, remained in Chinese. I made several attempts using various ways found via Google, but nothing worked.In addition to this, the camera did not work.",Bad
cheapest on its class and also worse. Id get better other one used mint on ebay for that price. awright.,Bad
"Not unlocked. I tried to load my SIM card, but I got a screen full of asterisks wanting a code. Turns out it wants a subscriber code - the phone was not, in fact, unlocked.",Bad
"The X compact feels slower, is not waterproof, is thicker, has an inconvenient USB-C port, has a camera which seems equal or poorer (especially in low light), and generally is not an upgrade in any sense of the word. Two positives: the black/blue color is beautiful, and the screen may be slightly superior. Not enough: upgrades need to be superior, Sony!",Bad
"Buyer Beware! I have had this phone for close to 9 months. The phone is constantly turning off for no reason. I will take a look at it to check the time or get information and the phone is off. I turn it back on. The next time I go back to look at it or use it, it is off again. This happens constantly and I don't know why. VERY frustrating! People can not get in touch with me because my phone is off and I am not aware of it. This phone takes horrible pictures as well.",Bad
Camera & memory is very limited need to add memory card to get the best use of this phone,Bad
Does not ring out. Not a good phone. Seller is excellent anyways. Just nokia is really poor,Bad
"I received this phone today from Amazon Warehouse Deals, sold as ""Like New"", but it simply would not power on. I left it to charge for a while, but I don't think it was even doing that since the phone didn't get warm. I do not know if this is indicative of a lack of quality control on Blu's part, but Amazon should have caught a major defect like that before shipping it out.The return process was quite easy, so I give Amazon credit for that at least, as it's already on its way back now.",Bad
"The phone is great! The reliability, however, leaves something to be desired. The phone randomly turns off in my pocket and I end up having to restart it. I'm not sure if this is due to a loose battery or loose solder on circuit board for the battery contacts, but I am disappointed with the quality of refurbishment of this device.",Bad
"It's a pitty. I really liked this phone, but sadly the two I purchased had digitizer issues (one had a dead spot, the other ghost touches). I have read this is a common problem with LG G2's.If I had time I'd keep trying until I got a good one, but I'm going to be trying a Samsung Galaxy S5 instead; slightly more expensive but it has a removable battery and SD card.",Bad
I'm sending it back only having it a few days. Reason why is that the battery sucks on this phone. If it was not for the battery it would have been a good phone. The battery runs down so gas and I have to charge it a few times a day and it takes forever to charge as well. So that's why I'm sending it back.,Bad
"Phone glass cracked near the top - Possible defect in glass, but more disappointed with BLU and their customer service. cancelled my second order for wife due to the possible defect and its not covered by any warranty. The phone did seem to work well, just not taking any chances - with out the cracked glass I would give it 4 stars.",Bad
first they were not courteous when i called about my purchase and then the phone had the wrong battery so the back of the phone wouldn't go on,Bad
The casing feels cheap and has that crappy after-market look. Not like the picture. There's spaces between the case and the white plastic screen bezel. No happy.,Bad
One positive phone is very durable - came with no instructions. When my wife speaks into the phone it sounds like she is in a well and can hardly hear her - this does not happen with all phones - but alot - everyone cpmlains about it. Probably have to buy here another phone.,Bad
The phone connection is bad (2-3 bars) when I use 4 G LTE. And the touch screen did not work properly while typing messages. So I returned it.,Bad
I love the Phone but I can not receive pictures on it. I had to buy another phone because of this. need to know can I send the phone back for another one or my money back,Bad
"I love the phone but it would not come on with my SIM card inserted. I tried everything. Don't know if the phone was defective or not, but I returned. Could not use. very disappointed.",Bad
"The phone is ok i guess, i not really liking the duo sim. couldn't get phone turned on for use",Bad
The sim card keep falling out and it has fall apart. One of the screws on the side literally fell out and this is a new cell. Its not even taking the charge. If I had spend more money on this I would have return it.,Bad
It is a little to small but the person that received it likes it alot. I think anyone would like the phone if they got it,Bad
The phone is great but it comes with an useless charger. It is necessary to get an adapter to be able to use it,Bad
"Hi, HTC Desire is a best of the best, except it has so many software issue, including camera pics keep disappearing and so many other users are facing the same issue but no explanation from HTC due its open source, think before u buy. i am also in tension spent $545 and this is what i ma getting a tension.",Bad
I have purchased a machine from you and was shipped to me in Saudi Arabia quickly and this is excellent but I discovered that the device no problem Balmicrvon a big problem I think I cheated here,Bad

"While the phone worked it was awesome which is why it got a two star. but 4 month later my phone worked in the morning, when i got to worked did not work, nor would it charge. contacted the company but since it was past 90 days they could do nothing or helpme get it repaired. I've looked up this issue and it is common. since it is a common issue i would not recommend it.",Bad
"i thought this item was good except when i got the memory slot was messed up i bought one brandnew and it wouldnt take,this is something i got for my daughter and was upset due to this problem",Bad
"cant make calls without loud static in the background, problem with the mic on the dock connector that used during calls, can only hear calls on speaker",Bad
This product arrived on time. I returned it because I did not like the phone. It was too small and didnt meet my requirements. I will order from this seller again,Bad
"I had the Xperia Z1 and loved the phone, so I decided to upgrade to the Z2 since the screen is a little bigger and the overall size is a bit smaller.The issues:Sony's stock messaging app still does not support group MMS message (WTH???)Phone heats up like crazy when I'm charging and playing games (never had this issue with Z1)First night of charging - I didn't close all the background apps and the phone was extremely hot in the morning. I went to bed with about 20% battery, and woke up 7 hours later and it only charged to 60%Second night - I closed all the apps, this time the phone wasn't as hot, but it still only charged to 60% or soI haven't had any luck making the charge past 85%, maybe it might just be my unit being defective...Won't be able to test this out for the third night - I am returning the phone.",Bad

I already reinstalled the software but nothing changed.",Bad
The phones features are great. The only thing is that... I've had the phone for a week and not dropped it once. Today the phone cracked when I dropped it... I was sitting on the floor when it slipped from my hand less than a foot up and the entire screen cracked. This material that it's made from is terribly fragile.,Bad
"the phone its not unlocked, it is asking me for a pin code network unlock, and i dont have it, so i cant use the phone.",Bad
This phone runs great until it breaks. The screen is cracked and I need it for my small business. Nobody locally will touch it because of the unique way the screen is made; they have to crack the LCD to get the broken glass out and then replace both of them.Samsung USA WILL NOT fix it and keeps telling me I need to call Germany and send it there for it to be fixed.So I am stuck with a cracked screen until I can afford a new phone because there is no way I am shipping internationally and risking my phone getting lost.Either way I am out $400 and I've only had it for 4 months.,Bad
"The phone is overall pretty bad in terms of performance but for this price, what do you expect? Only redeeming quality is the fact that the phone is waterproof so you could use it as an mp3 player in the shower if you so chose. Definitely not suitable as an everyday use phone though.",Bad
"I have started having problems with this phone the last month or so< only had the phone since January. Although I paid for a new phone I am beginning to wonder if this is a refurbished phone. I have talked with and visited T-Mobile, they stated the problem was in the phone. The phone doesn't receive incoming calls or text on a frequent basis; which creates a real issue, as this is my BUSINESS phone. Sometimes my messages are days late. Many of the apps I should have such as Samsung pay will not download on this phone; it states ""not compatible"", when it should be compatible with the 6 EDGE. Very disheartening! If this is not rectified I will never buy from this dealer again.",Bad
Good phone so far but highly pissed because I had to buy a 14$ unlock code for a T-Mobile phone when it suppose to be a unlocked phone!! The product details said unlock gsm phone but IT WAS NOT. Saler acted as if it was a problem to get me the Unlock code,Bad
"Not a huge fan of this phone. Much better value for money out there.Pros:-Full HD display is bright and beautiful-2gb of Ram helps keeps things somewhat smooth-Build quality is decentCons:-Will never be upgrades to newer version of android. This company fails when it comes to updating anything.-Qualcomm 400 CPU struggles to power this full HD screen. Lags and stutters are frequent.-Camera is terrible.-LTE does not work in the U.S unless on TMobile.All in all, there are much better options available than this for a cheaper price. Look to the Zenfone 2, Mezui MX2 Note, or even the Ulefone Be Touch 2 or Be Pro for larger screened phones with much better specs.",Bad
"Got the device. While it works fine so far, It came with obvious nicks both on the frame and small scratches on the screen. The description stated that this phone was refurbished. It also states the it looks and works like new.....nope to the looks, and time will tell wwih the functions.The only reason i am not returning it, is because it's a starter phone for a child.",Bad
"Absolutely hated this phone. There is almost no internal memory available. I couldn't even download ONE app. It wouldn't even let me update Google Play Services so that I could access some of the preloaded apps. The call quality was terrible, as was the service reception. Turns out this is one of those cheap China knock off phones that was re-branded. I only gave it two stars because it served it's purpose as a temporary phone until I could get a new one. So glad that I don't have to use this piece of crap any more!",Bad
"Buy 2 and not were what I expected, resources are very scarce, the manufacturer does not offer updates of the operating system and fail the batteries for replacement, in the end, I was wrong with these purchases.Sorry for my bad English but I don't speak English, and this is an online translation.",Bad
"This phone was quite beaten up, certainly not good conditionIt had the new IOS on it , which I prefer to avoid, as not coming from Silicon valley, or having a skateboard, I dont enjoy finding out the bugs... I chose this 4S as I wanted 32GB, 4G, Siri and the much better camera (8MP) than my old 4..and the system is more stableGood news, the vendor is exchanging it for me.",Bad
Its a really good phone but i guess i was always impatient. In conclusion it should not take nearly 2 months to deliver,Bad
What's going on with Nokia?The screen of the phone it's too thin and delicated.It's like a toy.Amazon's service was good.,Bad
"This phone was manufactured in a sneaky way which disables the LTE capability when it isn't used with a verizon sim card. You can't use it on any other prepaid plans fully functional and straight talk won't activate it at all. Not very ""unlocked"" if you ask me. Kind of a rip off when considering you're stuck with verizon, the most expensive network out there. Also the map app sucks and requires a monthly ""subscription"" which adds another 10$. you can'd download any google apps on the windows store, no snapchat, no google maps, no tinder. Even Instagram app is poor excuse for the normal version. I'm disappointed in this purchase.",Bad
"Samsung made major changes to it's interface from the Note 3 and not good ones. It is so much different from the last phone that I'm having a hard time using it. Say bye, bye to the edit button. The phones a pain in the, you know what, to even turn on. Quite the delay there. I do not recommend this phone at all and I've owned 5 Samsungs phone so far and say this is the worst yet. I would take my Mega over this phone.",Bad
"International (AT&T) Phone heats up on top side quiet often. However, since I am not a heavy user, it is ok now.",Bad
Product was not cleaned well. Phone speaker doesn't work well (cannot hear people when making phone calls; you have to use an external earpiece. and AUX outlet is testy.,Bad
"First off, I sent email one to seller where i told him: i need 3G bands 850/1900/2100 MHz, because i knew there are two versions of bands (other one was: 900/2100Mhz). Despiste that i sent warning about my preference, ""seller"" ignored my eamil one and did what he felt like, sent to me 900/2100 model. He can't say that did not see my email message because he answer to me ""OK""...,OK what ??. i am so felling injured.I musted to change my cellphone number, and networking provider to use "" the new one Samsung cellphone""",Bad
"It was very good but some of the keys are not working, so i was constrained to send it back.",Bad
"Battery doesn't last more than 2 hours, it goes from 50% to 10% in a minute",Bad
Phone is good but doesn't allow the Microsoft account to work with T-Mobile service. this means no apps!,Bad
"I ordered this phone based upon reading the reviews. Overall appeared to be a reasonable featured phone for the list price for which I bought it for. However not sure why NEW phone came with Android 5 and end user was supposed to upgrade to Android 6 just after opening the box. Since I am not a big expert on OS and its compatibility with apps, I did not want to change things on a NEW phone, but it kept bugging me that a upgrade was due. I did that upgrade spending hours on that -- luckily it went smoothly. However I am very DISAPPOINTED to see that CAMERA --> Advance settings --> like ISO settings have just disappeared. There may be other things in other Apps that may have got impacted with this OS upgrade, but don't them as yet.",Bad
it downloaded some Chinese app on my computer when I plugged it into the USB port.,Bad
The phone was great at first. I just had to get used to a touchscreen phone. Then I thought the battery was dying on me. I bought a replacement battery and still had the same problem. It turned out that the screen would just go out. problem just got worse. LG is not my friend.,Bad
Good for the price but. The phone would sometimes register a tap on the other side of the screen from where I tapped. And it had very poor viewing angles,Bad
"this phone networking problem, all time network up-down. no right way receive & send call so i want to return it.",Bad
"Super boring-looking phone. Has all the basic functionality, but nothing extraordinary. And the phone came damaged from the seller - had a small ding on the case... returned it in a few days!",Bad
"Everything is so great except the battery life. It's terrible and can't last for a full day.If battery life is important to you, don't consider this phone",Bad
"The lenovo A850 is a Chinese phone and as such the android operating system on the phone is all in Chinese and you cant install google play. To get around that you have to root the phone and install a custom ROM in English, hence why I bought the phone it being ""rooted with google play"" and all. That is not the case at all, the phone is programed in Chinese and as such everything is written in Chinese characters, google play does not function at all with the standard operating system on the phone. seller has used false advertising in the product description, and is a bad man who makes me cry. PHONE DOES NOT HAVE GOOGLE PLAY PRE INSTALLED, YOU WILL HAVE TO FLASH AND ROOT THE PHONE TO INSTALL IT",Bad
"I have had this phone since February and it has gone downhill drastically. Now the phone will not charge to full capacity without being powered off. In two hours the phone has reached than half of its battery life. The phone locks up continuously. First bad experience with a BLU phone, but probably will be my last.",Bad
"The phone came in great condition, it looks brand new even though it's refurbished. The only problem is the battery that came with it will only work while the phone is plugged into the charger. I wonder if this company will replace it since it's refurbished? Great phone, bad battery. Luckily I have an extra one since I have owned this phone before. Hopefully it lasts since I had that phone for 5 years. If they fixed this problem I would give it 5 stars",Bad
"This is the worst phone I've owned since my old flip phone. It is incredibly slow, laggy, and it freezes constantly. I need to restart it everyday just for it to function semi-properly. I also have not been able to download the new 5.1.1 operating system.",Bad
"Bad experience, the phone comes in a horrible case. It is not the original, also battered . The phone says VERIZON everywhere. I do not recommend to buy it . Just bring the cel and charger, there seems to be new ./ Mala experiencia, el telefono viene en una caja horrible. No es la original, ademas de maltratada. El telefono dice VERIZON por todas partes. No recomiendo que lo compren. Solo trae el cel y el cargador, no parece que sea nuevo.",Bad
"My flash does not work. I receive only the cable, without battery.I don't have the legal document to requist the consert, so now what can i do?",Bad
"After a month the system had an error,had to make a hard reset,since that it's not working properly.",Bad
"Phone is great I, mean seriously love it.The catch is I woke up this morning and the finger print sensor won't work. Now this seems to be a known defect with the phone. Amazon only has a 1 month warranty (bought in May, so only 3ish months old). GooglePlay disavows the phone cause I bought it thru amazon. LG will fix but I have to send my phone in for 7-9 days, no loaner, no replacement... for a known defect, they will fix and then ship it back. And it was a hassle getting LG to even provide that.Seriously love the phone, but buy thru GP, its not worth the $50 off or whatever.",Bad
"Bought this since I couldn't find any shatter-proof, waterproof phones from the US. Phone came in Russian and is apparently made in Korea. Who cares, right? Apparently they have very different standards for usability and user experience.Turning it face-down will silence your alarms. Guess you get to sleep with it lighting up whenever some app sends you a notification. Great.Volume buttons work when the phone is locked and the screen is off. Why? I NEVER find the sound profile on the one I last set it on, not to mention the options don't really take effect. Same stupid default ringtone plays even though I have it on another one.As a comparison, I had a cheapo pre-paid Android from Wal-Mart for a third of the price, and it's far better-designed.",Bad
I gave it close to a year and I am replacing it with an Iphone. Condition is still as new tho it never was at purchase and was definitely from some foreign country. Turns itself on repeatedly when in the shirt pocket and this well known problem cannot be fixed other than screen protectors and in my case electricians tape around the button. Its has a good screen protector and heavy case but not much better. My At&t minutes went from over 7000 to just over 700 in a month of its dialing up when my pocket with the screen lock securely set. It finds a way on its own to activate. Camera works well and too well as it is often turned on by itself in my pocket.,Bad
This phone had information on it from the previous owner and it was very disturbing when I was told it was from Apple but it had a fry brothers box and item number.,Bad
"I like the phone, but it doesn't work with my current carrier and I am returning it to the supplier.",Bad
"I bought two of these phones, the other being for my husband. His is working fine but mine is a dud and now how to purchase a new phone. My phone is slow, doesn't pick up service (I have tested the SIM card), and the battery life barely lasts a day. I won't re-purchase it, I will buy a different brand. This was my first LG phone purchase and disappointed.As for the other phone, no problems yet. The camera is not the greatest quality but is fine.",Bad
"A friend of mine has bought this cellphone. He was happy about it.When I received it, my first impression was good. It seems like quality cellphone from outside.The cellphone was a little difficult for me to set up. I had some problems with my micro SD card. In fact this cellphone has some compatibility problem with some Micro SD brands. I had to buy another because the cellphone did not allow my SanDisk Micro SD to function properly.I had to set up very carefully the cellphone because the battery only last 30 hs. I want to clarify that I only use one SIM and I do not use the cellphone for listening music, using Bluetooth, watching videos online or taking pictures. Maybe I take 6 pictures a moth. Thus, I only use it for calls, WhatsApp and some apps like weather or reading newspapers but only for 5 minutes a day.The cellphone is cheap but I am not happy about it. Next time I will save more money and I will buy a good brand cellphone.",Bad
"Nice phone. My daughter loves it. Seems pretty durable. It even has great features.Sadly, as my daughter's last Blu phone ..... the SIM adapter is horribly designed. You must use an adapter for a nano SIM cards. The card will not fit nicely. It will take several attempts.We ended up destroying the SIM slot by having to re-insert the SIM card so many times.",Bad
"It was painful to figure out how to change default language from Chinese to English. Yet, still some apps run in Chinese!I bought it for GPS. Nothing in this phone proves it!Another big problem, it fails to detect phone signal!Will return it!",Bad
I don't like the camera it is hard for me to take selfies I am used to having the voice snap I say cheese and it takes it. Also doesn't look crisp like my LG Phone. Then I tried to download some music and it sounds like when you watch a bootlegged movie. I really don't know what to do I am so disappointed with it. It does have an app that you can print from the phone never had that before and a FM radio. The battery also doesn't really last long like it says it does.,Bad
"I ordered this case as a gift along with a blue one for myself from a different post and beware! This case is not the newer model one so its more bulky then the newer model symmetry series. It also is not as smooth. This case is basically the same as the commuter case. If you're looking for the new symmetry series- with sleeker, more compact protection - this is not it. I returned it!",Bad
"all applications work but the camera is not focusing on a detail that the images that are 50 cm distance, but up close if well focused. I asked for a software upgrade but worked for 4 days and then persisted with that problem.",Bad
"The phone arrived on time and was working, however, the item is posted as used very good bu the phone came with many scratches/ small dings on the back of the phone on the colored part. I have t admit the screen was perfect without a scratch so that was great. I gave it a lower rating because it made me believe it would be good as new with maybe one scratch. Also, there is no sim card in the phone so you can't activate it until you go to the store and sometimes it may take some pushing to get the employees at the store to give you the card because they don't get commission on the small card.",Bad
The phone was ok until i start to use it for a week then all of a sudden it the phone did what it felt like then wouldnt turn on just dead. I just throw it in the bin where it belonged.,Bad
"Received with a cracked screen, got it replaced and the screen broke again while installing the glass protector. Shame, looks like it would've made a great inexpensive phone.",Bad
"This isnt the fones problem; this is a Blackberry problem. Blackberrys cant be used on Chitchat Mobile. So I am out the money, with a useless fone.",Bad
This phone is a starter phone those who are not used to smart phones. Very flimsy and slow. Not the phone for tech savvy people.,Bad
"I have bougth a lot of blu phone and always was satisfied. I hope more from this phone, it is octa core! Wow! But mine does not performance as expected. I can compare its performance as a dual corte phone. I am dissapointed with this phone. It performance is toÌ_ lag or slow.",Bad
"Good for the price. Phone constantly restart and random shut off. when use headphone jack can some time freeze phone. It claim to have 4gb but it is actually 2gb internal and 2gb external, which mean if you use SD card, you lost 2gb. There is no way to combine to 4gb. Hardly have any memory for app. Even with SD card is no help because app still use internal space. If you take 2gb minus Android, you have less than 1gb. Phone wouldn't let you install anything when you have less than 400mb.Edit: Forgot to mention. Screen doesn't respond touch when there is any water on top. I had iPhone before which still take touch with water on screen. People told me they had a hard time listening my voice. I had had to speak very loud, so they can hear me.",Bad
I like this phone but I'm having some difficulties with the Service I'm with its suppose to have 4G on this phone not 2G.. This phone also been flashed too many times,Bad
It works ok but it disconnects alot sometimes it just doesnt wanna work vwry well,Bad
I bought this phone in September (2014) it was delivered on the 4th and it is now October 21 of the same year. Watch out there is no warranty on this phone and now it won't charge. So we just spent well over a hundred dollars for a little over a month's worth phone service. When it won't work longer than that it wouldn't be worth it at any price. The window closes in 30 days for returns. Don't buy it.,Bad
"Unfortunately, the data/internet on this device is not working on AT&T carrier. AT&T technical support tried to fix the problem but it did not work because of incompatibility issue. So, beware of buying unlocked phone.",Bad
"I had this phone for one year and a few days before the screen went dead. I bought it brand new, not used or reconditioned. Had nothing but trouble with it. Terrible lag when trying to place phone calls and other strange bugs. The keyboard wasn't as useful as I thought it would be. It did work on Page Plus, but it was so troublesome that I seriously considered just going back to a basic non-smart phone.",Bad
"Purchased this phone because of all the great reviews but unfortunately it is faulty. It just won't stay on. You can count on this seller to get your purchase to you before the scheduled date, which is amazing! 5 stars for that! The phone appears to be brand new. It arrived with a glass screen protector and a case (awesome) but it just will not stay on long enough for me to set it up and everything ""Google"" crashes.",Bad
Charger that came with the phone did not work very well. Overnight charging only to gain full charge.,Bad
"This makes phone calls and sends texts and the internet is alright, but it can barely get any apps that iPhones or androids can get, my camera does not work and right before I wrote this, it froze for over an hour and a half.",Bad
The phone lags A LOT. Also how does the system functions take up half the internal memory? I have only 35 pictures and a 32 GB sd chip that I can't even figure out how to move things over to. Isn't what I expected at all.,Bad
"Had to return this phone immediately because it wouldn't work. Came with a user manual in some Scandinavian language. Tried to charge it but it wouldn't turn on, I had the battery in correctly. Couldn't troubleshoot because, of course, I couldn't read the manual.",Bad
"I bought this last month, until then I had iPhone 5c. Although this phone claim to be powerful, but the reality is not. It can't handle any load, managing two simple applications is difficult for this phone. The quality of the mic is very poor. Most of the times, I have to repeat to others.One of greatest feature is the battery life. Extremely good battery. it runs for 2 days easily (for medium user).It has great looks and screen brightness is very good.But my worry is on the performance side. The custom OS makes this phone really bad performer.My iPhone 5c, although very old works great. Huwei should focus on improving performance and mic quality.",Bad
She loves the phone but it has a bad charger and I have yet to hear back from them and I'm not happy about it.,Bad
I received the phone in good condition. I took it to the verizon store and it was easy to transfer my information. The phone worked well. After about 4-5 months the battery stopped working well. My phone dies after one hour. Maybe two hours if I am lucky. I am so disappointed. I have found myself in difficult situations without a phone or charger! I was hoping this phone would at least last one year. Not worth the money.,Bad
"the product is new , but it came with damaged microphone, also brings the headphones , I would like to know what to do in this case",Bad
"After having this phone for less than 6 months Im finding the phone wants to reboot daily, and I baby my phone due to lack of insurance (Sprint wont insure it) and its protected by an Otter box. Along with that is Storge issues.",Bad
This is a crappy phone. You get what you pay for! The old saying goes. The phone is lagging and slow. It randomly reboots sometimes. My recommendations is not to buy this phone. Going to buy another phone soon. But it wont be a phone from Blu.,Bad
This is the international version. It isn't compatible with AT&T's LTE network. I had to return it after activation.,Bad
"Motorola is one cheap company. Most certainly NOT on the level of Apple's iPhone. This phone is made with substandard parts that break easy. Plus, Motorola tries to find any reason to refuse to repair the phone. For example, my phone broke while in my backpack. It was new. one week old. The little pressure on the phone from the stuff in my bag cracked something under the screen. You would never know it was broken. Everything on the outside looked new with no scratches. iPhone would never break like this.This Motorola Android phone is one cheap piece of crap. Plus, many of the Google android apps had viruses or they did not WORK properly....I am going after Motorola legally for faulty design/manufacturing/parts. Other buyers have had the same problem.",Bad
The battery for the phone refuse to stay in the slot and for that the phone keep shutting off or heating up. My husband is really unhappy with this purchase I made for him.,Bad
"So apparently some of the nokia 925, heats up pretty fast, and I got one of it. So be careful with it.",Bad
"Recieved the phone, turned it on, it crashed after the update and now the screens unresponsive. Sees to be a common problem. Ordered a replacement.",Bad
"Decent product at best.Nice screen size and loud audio.However, the device reboots itself several times a day. Also, I've replaced my sim card with my provider several times, but the device intermittently continues to display no sim in tray one or two.Lastly and most disturbingly, there is no support from the manufacture. BLU will not be a company that my family will ever use due to the unpleasant experience we've had with this device and warranty service.",Bad
"The phone came in great condition and on time, I was relived thinking I would be able to activate this phone with my current sprint account and turns out it is NOT locked to sprint. So if you are a sprint costumer I highly suggest you not waist your time and money on purchasing this phone. If you are a Verizon costumer then you can use this phone because my sprint carrier said this phone was with Verizon.",Bad
The battery in this phone broke about 3 months after I received it. I am not impressed at all.,Bad
"I'll be the first 2-star review. This is definitely a bare-bones basic phone. But if a phone has a camera, I expect that I should be able to send picture texts. I got this to replace another Nokia phone. I figured since this was a newer model, it should have picture message capabilities. Not so!! No picture texts, and to me that is a basic functionality. Other than that, it's a decent phone. But I'm sending it back because I can't live without picture texts.",Bad
"Pros:- Snappy, new feeling- Price- Camera has a flash which is surprisingly rare on lower end phones- It's much better than my Alcatel One Touch- It has superior audio for its price range- It sync-ed immediately with my T-Mobile accountCons:- I cannot find a case for it online- case is slippery and it looks too feminine- It does not come with Swype pre-installedEDITED: Demoted this phone to two stars from three after a day of use. The phone is already slow at times and will occasionally crash on various popular apps. My app list is: The Economist, Wordament, Flashlight, Swype, Garmin Connect, King of Thieves, plus all standards apps to come with the phone",Bad
"Unfortunately, chose to return this item. The shipping was prompt, as was the customer service. Unfortunately, there will still pictures from the facility on the phone, and the up arrow on the phone was sketchy and did not light up.",Bad
HelloI bought 3 months ago and I have to repair the charging pin.It supposed to be a new one.,Bad
Touch screen broke. This was the second one I had that did it. They work good for about a year,Bad
"I've had this phone from this seller since Feb 2015. Since day one, the phone freezes and has to be restarted when switching between apps. Also, I have never been able to update the firmware making the frequent crashes more often as time goes on. The phone works but has been a pain and I am no longer able to use certain apps because the firmware is not updated.",Bad
Not so happy with this product ....the audio quality is poor and create noise during calls.,Bad
The features on the phone are good. The only problem I've got is that the battery life is on average 8 to 12 hours on standby. If the phone is used the battery life will drop to 4-5 hours. Either the battery is to small for the phone or the phone has a malfunction and consumes to much energy.,Bad
"The key board numbers and letters are too small. The cell phone works with 1 sim card of T-Mobile. It did not come with cell manual to follow up how the phone works. You have to play with it, to find out how it operates. It's frustrating to figure it out. I finally was able to change the Spanish Language to English. The quality of the cell material looks alright.",Bad
"This is strictly a product review as the seller was very expeditious and professional. The design and features are as good as expected for a company as successful as Apple. However, I was extremely disappointed when, after a few days having the phone, dropped it and the screen shattered to the point where it just didn't work. It wasn't thrown or dropped fromy very high. So, durability is nowhere near where it should be. This was my first iPhone, coming from a long time Samsung user. Needless to say, I went back with Samsung(GS6 edge) and am just disappointed that I wasted the money on the iPhone. Apple can't say I didn't give them a chance, however, back to the practical smart phone for me.",Bad
"The phone I received will not update... says variant OS... I believe we are being sold counterfeit phones... I am checking into this problem now... I have owned 2 of this model phone before this one... This one feels fake, poor build quality, slow, and cannot update from 4.2.2",Bad
the phone freezes and doesnt keep a charge. i wouldnt recommend it to anyone i know..but thats just my opinion,Bad
"Too much lag. You can't root it even though I bought it outright. I had the first Blu Studio 7.0 and I was able to root it and get it working with less lag than this one with lte. The original has a nice light blue colour. So if I had to choose between the two, I wouldn't pay extra just for the lte. I wasted $125.",Bad
"The texting wouldn't work on the phone, when I contacted verizon about the problem the told me the phone was defected.",Bad
"I bought this phone for my wife. We farm and are hard on phones. When she calls me, it is difficult to understand her. The microphone is not very good. It is also 2G so the reception is very spotty. We did not realize that it was 2G when we got it. If you have ATT it will be useless at the end of the year. We just got a notice from ATT that they will no longer provide service to 2G devices starting January 1, 2017.On the good side, it does appear to be rugged... my wife and kids have not managed to destroy it though with all of the scratches and dings it looks like they have tried.",Bad
"The case itself is great and certainly would protect my phone. However, the belt clip that attaches to the case bent the rubberized portion in the packaging making it not fit correctly. I requested a replacement and it had the same problem. This is disappointing.",Bad
"THIS DEVICE SHIPS WITH ANDROID OS 2.3.4, which was introduced in 2010. This OS it will not connect to any modern system that can upgrade it, nor will it interface with wifi. In order to use this as anything other than a (non-smart) phone, you must upgrade its firmware through a separate windows computer. Then, perhaps, you may be able to upgrade its os. It is, I would summarize, state of the art 6 years ago, and is definitely not ready for prime time today.",Bad
The item I purchased and had to return was not in the condition I had expected it to be. It was a gift for my young child to use to text me and I couldn't even see the letters due to heavy prior use. This information was not specified anywhere before purchasing. I hope it was an honest mistake.,Bad
"It s MUCH smaller than it appeared to be.The key-board is extremely difficult to use.I should have waited 55 days for a free up-date, but I wasin a hurry to have a phone with a keyboard. So thereforeI have lost the amount that I paid for this little phone.My own fault.",Bad
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,Bad
"Something was up with the MicroSim card slot. It would not fit a microsim so either the sim converter was wrong or it was the phone. My nano sim was too small and the microsim was too big. It did have a regular size sim card slot and that worked however, This phone would not accept the Project Fi Data Only sim. This is the reason I had to return it. I planned to use the phone for Uber and only needed data but it wouldnt recognize the sim. Also the phone is a bit too big for uber. Even with a CD or A/C mount. I think a 6"" sceen phone or 5.5"" would be ideal for uber. This thing is just too massive to be a phone and too small to be a tablet.",Bad
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,Bad
"This phone is plagued by the windows mobile os. The phone has all the features you'd want, but is incredibly buggy. It freezes...BAD!",Bad
"Phone worked very well and looked great for the first five months, until one day i was on the phone talking and the phone screen began to expand and crunchy crack all over the screen and dust glass particles busting out. I was scared kt was going to explode. This is very disappointing. It is very dangerous. I have heard of phones exploding. The phone did not fall and wasn't on charge. Just by it self. I have submitted a claim for a new one or my money back and am waiting fir their response.",Bad
"The iPhone I got was at my door in two days! I was very impressed, until I opened the box and popped out the Sim Card. Verizon iPhone, not AT&T like the description would suggest. Phone was in amazing condition, and I'm so mad to have to send it back!!",Bad
This phone is not exactly user friendly. I wish I hadn't bought it but I will keep on using it for now. My prior Samsung Flight phones were all awesome. This one isn't.,Bad
"First of all this phone did not have DUAL SIM, but that is the seller's fault for the bad description. However the screen quickly shattered even with a protector on and without even dropping it. Something just bumped my leg and it was done. Screen replacement is very high as well. not having airdrop and imessage really takes away ease of use.",Bad
"When looking to buy a new phone, I researched a lot of different phones; I have had this phone before and liked it so when I found it on Amazon I thought great this is the one for me. The site had two different phones advertised NEW and REFURBISHED; I didn‰Ûªt want to buy a refurbished phone so I clicked on the new button to add to my cart, but after receiving the phone I realized that it was refurbished.",Bad
The only issue that I had with the phone is that it was quite buggy. Often times I would have a difficult time restarting the phone even when using the button on the top of the phone as well as programs freezing. The fact that the battery cannot be removed only exemplified this as with other phones that would be the only way to quickly shut the phone down when there were freezing issues. The qwerty keyboard and blackberry hub were both excellent and the main reasons I had purchased the phone. Hopefully the model coming out in 2017 with the qwerty keyboard will work better on the android system.,Bad
"Apparently Prepaid phones are not compatible with regular plans. Wasted a bunch of time waiting for verizon wireless reps to help program my phone to no avail. After 30 minutes of technical support from Verizon, it was determined that Prepaid phones are not compatible with regular plans with Samsung Knack...",Bad
"It was not the team exactamante pedi, buy a new one and not get in that condition, but I attended and were able to resolve",Bad
"Horrible. I bought a refurbished one. Headphone jack doesn't work. Charger port doesn't work unless you hold the plug in or somehow manage to place it perfectly and not touch it. Battery life if great and phone generally seems okay. When it was new I'm sure it was awesome but this ""refurb"" should have went in the junk pile.",Bad
"the cellphone works well but the box was horrible, it looks all, the accesories came incomplete, it didn't brought the headphones.",Bad
"I have been wanting to buy a blackberry item since Thanksgivings.In spite of the rise of the andriods I moved from a palm pilot to a blackberry and it served me well until my blackberry curve died.I selected a 'new' instrument and observed the customer feedback here very carefully. Well I got burned. The phone arrived dirty and stratched up, without a manual or earpiece.The instrument and charger overheated after charging for less than an hour.I do not know what to expect in terms of performance over time. I am definitely sending this item back.What is it with the suppliers of these blackberries. They are taking your name down big time - Amazon.som",Bad
"Phone doesn't ring loud enough even set at highest setting. Speaker not loud enough. (Yes, I have excellent hearing) The provider keeps dropping numbers I have keyed into the phone.",Bad
I just got it today. I installed all of my apps and tested it out.Pros:CheapStylishSound qualityVideosCons:Not as fast as I thought it would beTerrible mic/recordingTerrible with popular apps such as snapchat/instagramCamera quality goes significantly down if you zoom inOnce in awhile it will stop detecting the sim cardI have been using this phone since June 2015. Now I am going to back to the flagship phone...learned my lesson.,Bad
"The best thing I can say is - it works but it is quite slow. I did not get it for the duo sim card feature, it was user error - I thought the duo sim card was different sim card sizes. If this is not the feature you need then I would but a more capable Samsung Device.",Bad
"I rather have a BlackBerry. The battery does not last that long. Although it is an unlocked phone, there are apps I can't use because it is made in Vietnam (not the US) plus can not register for warranty in Samsung page. I tried to return it less than 2 weeks after I bought it but I was being charged a 20% restocking fee!!!! It is an ok phone but I am NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE AT ALL!",Bad
"I was expecting something akin to the original LG Octane. That it was in looks only. Otherwise the performance was terrible. Sound was awful. It was like the speaker had been set to low and no amount of adjustment could change it. Signal strength was poor also. The operation of the phone was exactly like the original, but signal strength and sound quality was bad.",Bad
"Battery life is short. It is also not waterproof. They advertised that it was waterproof, but they are not telling the truth.",Bad
not what i needed for my att phone. it does not take a sim card. even though it was unlocked had to sen it back,Bad
"I have owned many phones and believe LG makes some of the best cellular devices money can buy. However, This device is not one of them. It is nice and big, has great specs and is definitely a bargain for the price. Unfortunately, the amount of display graininess and burn in is just too much to bear on a daily basis.",Bad
"Well, I bought this model because of the camera which is supposed to be 8Mg, but in practice it looks like 2Mg. I've had another mobile( a simple Nokia) that had just 3Mg and the quailty of pics were much better than this one. Also the Wi Fi is very weak.Pros:the audio is good and is GSM, unlocked. Not sure yet this purchase was a good idea, and worth the price. I'll give it more time of use.Update on 8/12/2016. After 1 year and 9 months...this stuff It's not functioning anymore!!!!. First, it was the imei which was repaired, now it's just not working. Suggestion: If you want something that last few more, don't buy this",Bad
"I only get 4g HSPA+ downloads speeds on cricketwireless (even though the title says LTE). It is only getting about 4mbps download when I get 8mbps with my other phone, Mate 2.Says HD display, but not impressed.",Bad
The speaker on this phone did not work and we had to repair it ourselves as the phone was brought to us overseas. Otherwise it is a very good phone.,Bad
"Phone leaves you feeling empty. If i can describe it, its like being a man but being castrated. The concept is great nice size phone, fast processor and crisp screen. The phone really has a horrible camera. The pictures look hazy. You may not realize it but you do need a good camera i have kids and family or a girlfriend i would like to take pictures of special moments and i am not going to lug around a camera in my pocket or neck. WARNING camera is REALLY bad buy this if you dont care about the camera. Good luck.",Bad

"Not too pleased with this phone. Seems to freeze with any new app I add, to the point I have to restart. Very unresponsive and glitchy all around. I couldn't get phone to work properly with sounds and alarms. The volume is also extremely loud with any headphones, even at lowest volume it hurts my ears. Phone didn't recognize certain headphone mics, couldn't talk through Mic, acts as if I have it on speakerphone and uses device Mic. I didn't use the phone long enough to review camera.",Bad
Given the great reviews on this phone I felt comfortable ordering it for myself. Very disappointing. it wasn't user friendly and the battery life was terrible. It may have just been my experience but I wouldn't recommend this phone.,Bad
For the money id say it's not worth it. Buy a $50 phone from target at least then you know it's compatable with your network. This phone I got lucky on and when I used it At&t sent me a message saying 2g was disappearing and they had a new phone for me as a replacement. I took a gamble on this phone and found it wasn't for me.,Bad

At first I thought it was just a one time thing, but when the got stuck a second and finally a third time, I said enough is enough.",Bad
It works very well with venezuelan operators but it has only to known lenguages: English and french. When using predective dictionary you'll have a lot of problems. The batery last longer than any other like phone. I knew about the problem with the lenguage but I did not know it would be such a problem when writing SMS's.,Bad
"Does not work with AT&T US sim cards. The two-sim setup must be for SIM cards in other countries, because it is not the standard US size--the SIM size is too small.",Bad
"Great screen, slim and light. Occasionally gets quite warm. The reason for two stars is durability, it has none. The power switch quit after 14 months on the first phone. I've owned 20 or so phones and never had a power switch quit on me. I bought a second phone for a family member and the screen auto cracked. This is likely the reason it is only $100 now versus $240 a year ago. Great phone but do not expect it to last for more than a year.",Bad
Not properly unlocked. It doesn't work with any SIM because T-Mobil still block the use in different countries and operators. It's not a good choice.,Bad

"I have never had any problems with Amazon.com... but this transaction was not really helpful.The product claims it is factory unlocked and RM 821... however, it seems that the product is actually unlocked version of AT&T phone and is RM 820.While the phone works fine, it is a lot of nuisance to have all these AT&T logos all over the phone when you are really not its user.Wish I had known this before as I would have not ordered the phone then.",Bad

"The phone came without headphones, sim card removal tool and OEM USB cable and AC power. After I contacted them asking the OEM accessories, they only sent me the sim card remover, the USB cable and the AC Power.About the phone: Is rooted by AT&T so you can't updated to Android 4.3 or 4.4.",Bad

"I purchased this phone a couple of weeks ago and a friend of mine just brought it from the US to Argentina 5 days ago when i started to use it.

"Although the phone is setup like I would like a phone to be it frequently shuts itself off when overworked, is limited by its software and is an overall disappointment. Not worth the price.",Bad
"So, my last review said that this phone is wonderful and great and I love it..and well I love it but it is slow it disconnects to wifi and connects randomly and sends notifications about WiFi randomly and its pretty annoying to be honest, second of all I just took my phone off the charger at 100% and looked at a snapchat and looked a the percentage and it dropped 10% just like that. This phone should be sent with a second battery or a better battery, because some of us cant make it to a phone charger with busy life's like me and most of everyone out there. This phone is great but these flaws need to be handled and this phone would be great, but until then......didnt last me a week, waist of money!!!",Bad
"Bought the phone because of a good quality RAZR that I used to own. So far I like the phone and it met my expectations regarding look and feel -- but am disappointed with internal problems. This phone drops calls regularly unlike the cheaper phone that this one replaced. Tried to resolve this through my cell phone company but reactivation produced no better results. I also find that the interface will ""lock up"" occasionally so that I have to wait before I can regain control. There is also a faint buzzing sound in the background when I make calls. So now I am going through the process of returning it. I should have taken note that the reviews are mixed for a reason. I got a lemon.",Bad
Phone did not come in color requested and didn't not bring a charger. Also had a lot of scuffs and scratches from wear and tear.,Bad
"User friendless. I have always had to use the cheap phones due to not having a lot of money. This one is worse than all the others. I bought it because it had great customer reviews, but I should have known, most the reviews were from people who were rich enough to have smart phones and this was their alternate. The worst part is that it is a 2g phone and all cell phone networks are getting rid of them. Needless to say, I had to replace it only a couple of months after I bought it. I also did not like that it would tell me I had a missed call but not alert me about a voicemail until after I called the person back and they asked what I thought about something they said on the voicemail.",Bad
"purchased this phone in June of 2016, November 1 the screen locked up, took it to a Samsung service center and was told the warranty expired in March of 2016 and it would cost me almost 300.00 to fix because it is a mother board issue. not sure about seller but i would not buy a refurbished product again i could have paid less for a new phone with a 12 month date of purchase warranty",Bad
"This was supposed to be used, in good condition. The first one I received had cracks in the bezel around the screen, 3 to be exact. So I requested a replacement. The second one had a crack also.

problems with phone... wont accept wifi.. taken to best buy twice for help they say send back phone is no good,Bad
I want to start off and say I really do like this phone case. The biggest problem with this case is if you drop the phone more than once the case will crack on the back making it difficult to open and retrieve your cards. I ordered one loved it immediately ordered 2 more in different colors but ALL 3 had had the same problem. Wish they could fix that problem otherwise it would get a 5 star rating from me.,Bad

I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE WENT ALL THE WAY AROUND JUST TO GET THE 8 DIGIT PIN CODE OF MY SIM CARD AND NEBVER GET IT. MY ADVICE TO EVERY ONE IS DON'T BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE OVERSEAS, TOO MUCH HUSTLE AND JUST WASTING TO MUCH TIME. I WANT TO RETURN THIS CELLPHONE AND IT COST ME TO SEND IT BACK. I WILL BUY ANOTHER CELLPHONE THAT I CAN USE OVERSEAS. I DON'T LIKE IT...",Bad
Really really disappointed that you can't charge your phone through a case. I read a lot of reviews that said it would work through a case and a lot of reviews that said it wouldn't. The case on my phone is not even that thick so I thought it would work but it doesn't. I guess I was one of the Unlucky ones. As delicate as the Samsung Galaxy S7 is you have to have a case on it. Samsung should have made this charger to work through cases. Very disappointed.,Bad
"The phone is super slow compared many current generation phones. I was replacing a lost galaxy nexus with this purchase, and it was such a disappointment. The touchscreen is not very responsive, the interface is slow.the pros: good antennas, loud speakersthe cons: slow processor, bad battery life, bad touchscreen sensitivity, bad camera, outdated OSMy advice: save your money and invest in a better phone that isn't completely outdated. You will be happier and avoid frustration. However, if all you need a cheap phone that average or below-average in all aspects, this an acceptable option",Bad

"If the phone goes dead when I turn it back on, my organized screens are messed up so I have to move the apps back to their spots. I also ran out of room so I added a memory card. my husband was not able to add my pictures to the memory card, so he backed everything up, and did a factory reset to see if everything he backed up would be on the sd card, but nope my pictures are gone while my apps were still on there, what gives????? Not happy, even though i only had the phone for a week it had pictures of my family who were visiting from Germany. I tried putting them on my computer but it wouldn't let me, and i couldn't put them on any social media, as my brothers does not allow pictures of his girls on there, so now they are gone!!!! The phone also will rarely charge, when it does it takes over 7 hours OFF and when turned on is still only at 70%, it will also not hold a charge, it goes from charged to dead within minutes!!!",Bad

"This phone... not exactly fun to use, but what can you expect from something that costs $20, there is no way to put it on silent mode so it's either off or loud and the sound settings can only be modified a little so you could technically record a silent ringtone for when people call you but only when people call you, not with text message. Also, every time you push a button you will notice that it makes a frustrating *blip* sound for every button push. Luckily I only have to use it for another two months.",Bad
"It is a nice phone, very inexpensive for what you are supposed to receive, and if everything worked it would be wonderful. I can barely hear when people call, and customer service solution,"" to use the headphones"", not exactly a fix! The manual that comes with the phone is inadequate, and printed on such a small page one needs a magnifying glass to read it, and then so many important directions are missing, and the website is no help.Customer service is quick to respond, however the solutions they offer, send the phone back, and my cost, and lose all your data, continue to pay for service while waiting for repairs. This is not first class customer service.",Bad
"Whether you like this phone or not is totally relative to what you've had experience using. If this was my first smartphone I would most likely be satisfied. But I had an HTC rhyme and this is a definite downgrade. The biggest issues I've experienced are 1. There is no indicator light to flash after you've missed a call or text. 2. In the email program on the dashboard there is the capability to view existing folders however no way to move messages from your inbox to folders. You can get around this by opening your email in an internet browser. 3. The autocorrect is really weird and not as intuitive as newer models. That being said, if you're looking for a temporary phone as a replacement until your upgrade renewal period comes as I was, it does the job and I'd rather use this than my rhyme with a cracked screen.",Bad
"Great item!Update on March 1, 2015: We only use this phone when we visit Peru. Therefore, any problems with the phone can only be noticed after a trip.On our trip in November of 2014, phone was fine. We came back to the US and stored the phone until our trip on the third week of February of 2015. We try to charge the phone, but it seemed that the connector where the charger connects with the phone was loose. We had to put the connector in an angle to make it connect with the phone to charge.Currently, it is very hard to connect and charge it.",Bad
"This is my third one of these. The first one worked great for two years, no complaints, never gave me any problems... until the battery blew up. My carrier replaced that one under my total equipment protection plan with a reconditioned one. That one lasted two days before bricking itself. My carrier refused to replace it with the same model a second time, citing their ""policy"" (which was never explained to me clearly.) The only phones they'd replace it with did not have physical keyboards, which is something I absolutely have to have. (I have Parkinson's and shake too much to use an on-screen keyboard) So the only way I could do it was to purchase a new one on my own, which I did, my third one. This one also tries to brick itself now and then, and will suddenly reboot itself for no apparent reason while recharging, but it's the only smartphone sold today that I can actually use, so I'm stuck with it.",Bad

"I've had this phone for a few months now and the phone works great. Though, I have switched from this phone to another phone and I was trying to sell it and I'm not seeing that the phone has an outstanding balance on the IMEI which is not allowing me to sell it on swappa. I'm upset at this because now I am either being forced to use it or use it as a paper weight. I'd like some answers.",Bad

It suddenly died after a few months. I took it to a store to get it fixed but they said it wasnt worth it. So I had to get a new one.,Bad
"I got the phone, it had barely any scratches except for a small dent which was mention when i bought it. However, after a week or two it shut off randomly. Luckily, I took it to apple and they said they'd give me a new one no questions asked. Had apple not taken care of me, I would've been very disappointed with my purchase. I'd give it one star, but in the end I ""won"" by getting a brand new replacement.",Bad
"This device heats up way too quickly and can get really hot. The fingerprint sensor is decent, although nothing compared to the accuracy and responsiveness of the nexus 5x sensor. I would've kept this phone if not for the thermal issues which is quite a defect in this phone.",Bad
"I bought two units and each one presents a different problem. In the first smartphone microphone does not work in normal mode, only the speaker, in the second does not work in speakerphone, just in regular microphone. After three months of use, the first device went out, as if the battery had run out, and did not receive more cargo. After many attempts I decided to replace the battery by the second unit, which has only one month of use, with the exchange both smartphones work well, but if I undo the changes the first device stops working. Weird smartphones !!",Bad

"The phone looks great at a glance, but after 2 months I started to use it the battery got swelled. I contacted Samsung and given that I am in Uruguay but purchased the phone in US they told me that they cannot replace the battery. Of course I was very disappointed with this response, especially because the title of the product said International Warranty but seems the warranty is only valid for the country where I purchase the product. The other problem I had was when I inserted an SD card. The photo gallery was very slow to display pictures and freezed the phone. Even clearing the cache didn't fix the issue and the only way I could see the photos was installing QuickPic.The phone is much superior to the old HTC Nexus One phone I had for 4 years or so, and if I had not had problems like these described this would be a very good phone, however my experience was not good.",Bad
"Ordered a blue Envy3 and received blue but the inner workings are that of the maroon Envy3. Not sure how that happens, but not crazy about the maroon. Other than that, it's a great phone, just wish it was the blue I ordered. I did contact the company, but they never answered back.",Bad

Second day I had it I was not able to get the back on the phone clipped on. another friend who had the same one before upgrading said there's did the same thing. They constantly had there battery falling out & powering down the phone because the clips are chinsy. VERY solw to connect with service & internet too in areas where signal is great.,Bad

"This case does what it is supposed to do, but after using it for a week I found that the button on the case that covers the power button on the tablet had pressed the power button all the way down and partially under the tablet case. This made the tablet useless. All that would happen was the screen would flicker off and on. I sent an email to Otter Box to see what they could do to remedy this, replacing my tablet would be a good start. It has been 5 weeks since this happened and I still have not heard from Otter Box. I brought the tablet and the case to Best Buy to see what could be down to fix this issue. Since the tablet was a week old they kindly gave me a new one. So as I said them case does its job for the most part except when it breaks the tablet and the customer service at Otter Box is terrible",Bad

"It's a great phone that I REALLY wanted to love... or even like. Was very nice looking and not all too glitchy. Oh, and who doesn't like waterproof!? Phone quality on calls was where it stared to hate me. Wasn't to loud and call quality was somewhat poor on both ends. Returned though because of the bad battery life. Maybe I got a bad one? But with the batter size I'd expect more than getting half a days use on the lowest brightness setting and 2 battery and cleaning apps put together with low processing used, while in my pocket. Yeah, I went that far. Good phone if your close to a charger more often though. I feel bad doing this, giving it 2 stars, but what's a phone without something well made to power it? I know you smartphone people can agree with me here that like to be out and about and travel as well. Good phone besides that th",Bad

"What I like about this phone: the back camera- stalker quality. the durability. It has dropped, had stuff drop on it (freshly brewed coffeepot for one....) and survived to tell another day. The downsides: product glitches- at least every other day, no instruction manual, a defective pair of random headphones- how can I use headphones where one wire is at least half the length of the other??? And the factory unlocking.... it's a pain in the arse to have a phone locked to att. If I had known that would have been the case I would have brought a friend's old one and called it a day. The volume seems to be permanently low- I make calls like I'm in in an old cellphone commercial. Oh and apps? They don't like windows phones. In short buyer beware.",Bad
"Not too well .however, I have to used it.I actually buy it to send it to Africa for my wife. I thought it could make a voice call given the fact that it takes SIM card. But to my disbelieve , she calls and say it don't make a voice call. She has to used it for the unintended propose.",Bad
"I bought this as a gift for my sister overseas and It's a very Nice phone if you don't need internet. Seems to only use Edge, which it doesn't allow you to watch videos. I kept switching the sim slots to see which is faster but it's all very very very slow. Wifi may help but if you want 3g speed find another phone. not to mention the low memory. I've had way better phones for cheaper. There are apps that needs internet, Doesn't make sense to have the features if you can't use them.",Bad
"No updates for software, blue seems to create and forget. Could not play marvel contest of champions without locking and restarting. Vudu app could stream but not download videos. Videos were crisp, speaker volume was low and battery life was sub par. The screen cracked on me the other day and with the one little crack, the entire touch screen was rendered unresponsive.In short, a poor smart phone, but with a descent Bluetooth speaker it is a pretty nice mobile video unit",Bad
"This phone would have been great had it been eligible for the Windows 8 upgrade. There just aren't many useful apps and my most used and favorites were non-existent. It uses the Facebook app from when any sort of edit features were available. Pinterest was a no-go, even things like Skype and such were not available. IF this doesn't bother you, the weight of the phone and the clarity of the camera was nice. I would definitely hold out for a Windows 8 version. I ended up returning it and buying the cheaper Go-Phone Lumia 635 with a lesser camera and like it much better already because my apps work! I would have liked to have had the better camera but those with Windows 8 were out of my budget. I do like the 635, however.",Bad
"this phone automatically connects to internet for everything, so be careful or you will end up with overage charges .,",Bad
"After few months with this phone I can say that I love it. But the phone started just crashing all the time. No more updates were available for it. The screen resolutions is awesome, the camera is decent, easy to use, very thin. I ended up getting another phone and will have this one as a backup.Not worth the $$ IMO.",Bad
The case is really cheap cracked first day I got it and I didn't drop it.,Bad
I feel tricked after getting the phone today. What I was told was not the same as when i got it. I am so disappointed. The charging area of the phone was broken and create problem with the charging in the future.,Bad
"This is my first time buying a refurb phone. Now I know why the price is low...risk! I realize the deal now, so let my experience inform your decision. I bought the phone and immediately applied a screen protector. Error number 1. Make sure you put the phone through its paces before sinking money in a screen protector because if later you find a problem, a bad earphone jack in this case, you are out the money. Also I'll be without a phone while I order another. I've got to repackage and ship, which will cost me money. The thing that really gives me heartburn is setting up a new phone. Time is money. So I may be contemplating error number 2...giving a refurb another try! Hope springs eternal.",Bad
"The equipment brought the damaged battery and in addition it does not raise 3G, really of so many purchases it is the first time that I remain so disappointed. I hope that it does not become common, it is sad that does not come to you what really you bought.",Bad
"Bought 2 as new, however, 1 battery barely holds a charge leading me to believe it may have been refurbished or used.",Bad
The BB9900 phone is not a new one.1.The USB port is dirty and with mark of scratch.2.Headset is not original.Quality is bad.3.The surface of phone have mark of scratch.,Bad
"It is too much fragile. The money cost over the Z2 is not worthy. There was no performance upgrade.Nevertheless it arrived very quickly.I DO NOT recomend the smartphone itself, but I DO recomend the vendor, which must get a 5 star evaluation.Shame on SONY for such a big project failure!!!",Bad
"I have had bad luck with ordering mobile phones through Amazon! I ordered this Motorola MOTO S ST1060 on July 15, 2015. The phone worked the first month but the MOTO phone stopped being able to receive of place calls after that first month. I could only use the message function. Now the phone has completely stopped working. (The phone has not been dropped or gotten wet) Since I purchased this phone on July 15, 2015 it is no longer returnable. To be fair to the brand another member of our family has had his MOTO X phone for almost two years and has not had any issues. The non-problematic MOTO phone was purchased at the Verizon store, plus I am not sure it is the exact same model as this one that I purchased in July.åÊMotorola MOTO X XT1060 16GB 4G LTE Verizon CDMA / Unlocked GSM Phone - White",Bad

"After using this phone and sony tablet for almost a year, the power goes off permanently, hard or soft reset wouldnt revive it, recharging is impossible, please beware before considering to buy any SONY PRODUCT.",Bad
"Visually it is great. Cheaper than new. Everything works.BUT...the battery is absolute crap. It doesn't hold a charge. Has to be charged every single day.Often, when the battery reaches approximately 30%...the phone just shuts itself off. Not a convenient thing to happen, especially if you use your phone for work and keep it in your pocket. or don't check it often. It just doesn't ring- so you think that you are not receiving calls, when in reality you are missing calls because the phone has shut off without you knowing it.This is my only complaint.( But it is a very big problem for me ).",Bad
I bought this phone for using in Venezuela. I switch the new chip and now is asking me for an unlock key. I dont know why. Was not supposed to be already unlocked? Could anybody help me please?,Bad
After one day it turned super slow. The ppi is low and feels cheap. It did come early. I hate the bottom lay out,Bad
"I have a Problem with my Galaxy Note 2 SGH-I317. Suddenly my cell phone started to restart repeatedly. I just have two weeks with my phone. I did try installing the firmware but I don't know where can I get it and what exactly version it is, I just know my phone has a 4.4.2 android. Thanks for the help",Bad
The Q&A said this comes with a US power adapter. Mine did not. I got the German pin-type power connector without any adapters for the US.,Bad
"Okay, the phone itself is decent for the price; my husband has it and loves it. The problem for me was that the screen won't stay ""asleep"" while I'm talking on it. I've been in the middle of a conversation and it will come unlocked and my cheek will start dialing numbers or switch over or even hang up. I even ordered a new phone to swap in case it was just the phone but that one did the same thing. It must be me b/c I couldn't find any other reviews that mentioned this problem. I don't know what it was but it just didn't work for me. I returned it for the Samsung Galaxy Rush and I LOVE that phone.",Bad
"Ordered one of these, and the next day the phone started shutting itself off and on every 30 secs. returned it and got a replacement which worked fine for maybe a week, then also started shutting off and also will not connect to ANY wifi.",Bad
"was not worth the money, came with speaker problems that was not listed in the description!! this should not have been sold for this much money!!!",Bad

The GPS signal reception is not good with this cellI tested with another cell (another brand) and the signal was much better.,Bad
The phone has someone and a number installed when my son received it and Sprint refused to activate it. My son is returning it to me and I don't know what I want to do yet. Not happy.,Bad
This phone freezes a lot! When i try to do something it exits what im doing. Sometimes i dont even see that i received text messages because it glitches. Im really unhappy especially after paying so much money :(,Bad
"Disappointed since i've only had the phone less than a year and its practically worthless now. Constantly overheats, runs extremely slow.",Bad
I received this phone yesterday and Everytime I try to play a game on it the phone shuts itself off. I used to have this same model of phone and never ever had that problem before.,Bad
"Phone screen doesn't always work, screen sometime just shuts off and phone restarts. Sometime when o click a contact to call it calls a completely different one.Love these phones this one is faulty however.",Bad
"The phone model itself is really nice, but this refurb from chubbiestech, the battery had about 8 hours life, and the wifi quit working less than 3 days after getting it. It did look pretty professionally done. Screen and case looked good, but the phone had some manufacturer defects. I don't have time to keep dealing with this, so I'm returning for a refund and buying new,",Bad
"I bought two of these phones. The first one was Black and it is still in excellent condition. Then I bought a white one recently (August 2016). I exchanged the first white phone shipped to me, as it did not have a USB cover, which makes it waterproof. The second one had the USB cover, but it keeps falling open. The interior plastic or rubber part to the USB cover is defective. It will not secure. Further, it appears the other materials on the white phone are significantly inferior to those of the black phone materials. The white phone has both cheaper looking and feeling plastic or glass and metal exterior parts to the black version I received.I certainly would not risk dunking the white phone in water. So, I am not quite clear on what ""refurbished new"" means. Be cautious, certainly when purchasing the white Z3v or any ""refurbished"" product. .",Bad
"I don't like this at all. I really wanted to, but it's cheap, cheap! It does NOT fit 3 credit cards like it indicated in the box. It holds barely even 1 credit card. There's a nice mirror feature, but even when I take out the mirror I still cannot hold more than 1 credit card. The case does NOT fit my IPhone 5S very nicely either. The close and open fold is cheaply made. It's very loose, and it makes my power button distorted when trying to turn the phone one and off. I had really high expectations for this case, but the search continues for a well-made case that can hold one credit card.",Bad
"Becomes a memory hog after few weeks of usage. The phone didn't come with a charger, even though it came directly from Amazon.",Bad
"So it fell out of my pocket the screen broke and the phone couldnt turn on, i went to 2 differemt places who said they cant fix it i gotta buy a new phone. Great! Lasted a full 40 days.. If someone has an idea where i could fix it maybe please let me know",Bad
I have used the cell phone for a week and It doesn't work properly. It reboots itself for no reason and the screen suddenly turns black with the lead light twinkling.,Bad
Works well EXCEPT stores same data in both removable SD and phone. Of course I have it set up to go into the removable. The BLU help app isn't working.,Bad
"I've had and loved other HTC phones. This one does not live up to its brand at all. I bought two for my girls this past Christmas, and they've had nothing but problems, despite being long time cell phone users. Part of the problem is the crappy Windows software, but even if that was not a PITA, the hardware is already falling apart, and its just mid-January! The tilt feature broke the first week in one of them. I bought extra batteries for them, and its a good thing because the battery life is almost non-existent. Also, they are very bulky, so if you want a fairly light or small phone this is not it.",Bad
"I bought this phone from amazon, the cell is great, it is slim to fit my pocket and has big beautiful screen, lots of functions. My daughter likes to draw in the screen and I will keep those drawings as my screen picture.But at first the battery lasted 2 and a half days before I first charged it, after that the battery could only last about 12 hours without making a call. I charged the cell overnight and made a 10 min call in the morning, the battery was dead at 4 pm so I could not call my wife. I tried both charger and usb cord to charge it, but did not make any difference. Maybe I got a defective battery or made wrong cell settings.Amazon is good so I got a refund after returned it. I bought a Nokia E63 from Amazon and this phone can last 5 days with 20min call everyday and some wifi using(1500 mA battery). but my girl can not draw in my cell anymore and it's very big. I will get this LG phone if its battery can last 1 and a half day.",Bad
Its a good phone that takes very good photos... I gave it a two star rating because it started to shut down during calls.. N the battery life starts to deplete easily... It even shuts down when charging n gets really hot at times,Bad
"The overall physical look and feel of the phone is great, screen resolution, buttons etc. but it really lacks in performance. It had a hard time playing the simplest games and it was pretty laggy like it does not have enough muscle to support the high definition screen. I really liked the phone, it was beautiful and the size was perfect but I ended up returning the thing. I'll probably buy it again if BLU does an update on it or something that will make it perform like the way it should.",Bad
"I loved this phone when it first came out and was thrilled to find it when my dumb phone died, but unfortunately the buttons on the front stopped working and the inner screen blacked out soon after. Have since started using a hand-me-down smart phone because replacing dumb phones twice a year just isn't cost effective.",Bad
Old phone and the buyer I purchased it from hadn't fully cleared their remaining items of the phone. Lots of new apps do not work on this model.,Bad
"The phone was great, loved it, then it just would not fully boot up. I had it less than 6 months and since you can't remove the battery there is no way to really reset and try again. I had to buy a new phone, waste of money :(",Bad
"This phone is international phone but not USA phone. I thought it was sell in USA; However, it is ship from China. The ac charger is too big too fix in USA plug. The phone is color gray but the ac adaptor is white. I does not have 4 G for my Tmobile , so it is very slow connection for online.",Bad
I can't figure out how to make it work. The directions are very confusing. ATT had no idea how to help me. I don't even know if they put the right sim card in. Very confusing.,Bad
"For T Mobile customers thinking about purchasing this phone, dont. It is not compatible with T Mobile after the refarm they just completed on their 1900 MHZ spectrum. From what little use the phone got, since it's unusable on the T Mobile network, it seems like a quick phone with fast start up times and shut down.",Bad

"I love this fone and been looking around for a new one but its impossible to find one so i came accross this seller with his high rating. Unfortunately the fone has used parts, if not all of of it is used. The key pad looks used, the front screen isnt fixed properly not to mention that itsn't the original screen it could have been taken from a demo fone or just a fake screen. This product is fishy and the speaker isnt clear.PS. before making this purchase i contacted ross cellular to confirm that its new and they lied about it!",Bad
"I realllly reallly was hoping that this was going to be an incredible phone. In terms of physical specs, it is. However, there is just no support at all for this phone. One of the things that can make a phone successful is if it has a strong and large community of supporters. Be it on xda, android forums, etc. You will find little support for an identical phone called the K-Touch V8, but that's mostly a non-english speaking community.The reason why I was let down was because the phone constantly kept crashing on me. And it wasn't one of those random reboots. It was an actual shutoff. So there were multiple instances throughout the day when I realized my phone was off!!On a more positive note, when the phone was actually on and working, the phone was quite fast and snappy. The screen was incredible.Other comments I'll make is that for the same price point here on Amazon, you may as well be getting a flagship device.",Bad
It was my understanding that this would be supported by Verizon.. so we got the phone and it is not... hope I can send it back. If on a contract (like us) it is $175 to get off. Have enough trouble trying to outfit older parents with a useable phone.,Bad
Is not LTE phone it's 3g and I get hot a lot so I am not this happy about it,Bad
"""Refurbished"", more like ""Take it, it's broken but cheaper!"". Battery is in its worst condition, and there are scratches everywhere. The Touch ID is non-responsive. Bad product.",Bad
I live in Venezuela. I'm having problems with the mobile data. I tested my sim card in other smartphone and the mobile data works ok. Is there any settings to fix this problem ?,Bad
this product was disappointing. I have to constantly reset the battery and sym card. I would like to try another phone and return this one.,Bad
If you have enabled GPS/Wi/sycn the baterry's use ends just only in 20 hrs. Besides this model not includes the face camera,Bad
Broken within a week of minimal use. Constantly dropped signal. The screen is horrible.Returned. (thank you Amazon),Bad

Bought this phone as a gift. The person I gave it to had several complaints about it now working as it should. One of the many was not receiving calls for no reason. I have a S5 and I faced similar issues. I think it is time for me to try another brand.,Bad
i really needed it but its screen protection made it soo hard to text or use my phone,Bad
I bought this Phone and within 5 days it started freezing all the time. I could not even make calls because it would freeze or crash. This seller is very responsible and solved the problem by changing the phone.,Bad
"The item, I received is a piece of junk. The piece was described as ""like new"" and ""excellent condition"".In reality, it was roughly used. One can find a better piece in trash than this one!",Bad
Im not exactly happy with this purchase as II believe that i received a dead battery. All I have ever been able to do with the phone is forward it to another number .,Bad
"Not that I had a chance to use it. It freezes screen, changes my storage, charge most the day then dies in half a day in idle and faster if I use it. Gets hot when charging.",Bad
This phone is one xl only dual core.One X is quad core.PLEASE NOTICE THE CPU INFORMATION BEFORE U BUY IT.,Bad
The phone is big and nice just what I want but the battery life sucks,Bad
"Upon ordering this item I was aware that it was used with some cosmetic damaged as described by the seller. Upon recieving the phone I became oh so aware of how ""used"" it was. This is a self proclaimed ""rugged phone"" so why is it that when I just simply flip the phone close it shuts off. I'm not dropping it from 5ft let alone 1 inch, I'm simply shutting the phone as you have to with flip phones! I've come to the conclusion that it must be the battery, either loose or something causing it to jar off the power mechanism therefore loosing battery power.Bottom Line: ""you get what you pay for"" very true statement, ""you expect to get what was described to you by seller, and then when it gets to you its all a lie and a piece of junk"" also very true of this product.",Bad
Started wearing apart with first three uses. Changed colors from NORMAL usage. I would not recommend this product to friends/family.,Bad
"This phone was able to be switched over to the Cricket network. However, trying to obtain consistent reception was a nightmare. The phone would jump off network,I wasn't able to send & receive messages and if they went through it wasn't time relevant anymore. A total nightmare. Don't get this phone if you're with a Cricket carrier.",Bad
The speaker phone quit working almost immediately. I wear hearing aids and always use the speakerphone as it does not create feedback or require the hearing aids to make automatic adjustments as they do when the phone is held to my ear.,Bad
"Everything is just fine, but I hate the UI and Android is only 4.2.1. One thing that really annoys me is that they make the background image blurry.",Bad
its a good phone foe some but it don't have the g-sensor and its listed as having one so this phone won't work as a vr display for google cardboard or apps like that,Bad
Ring tone was to low and it was to its maximum. I gave it a two because the camera took clear crisp pictures.,Bad
Blu studio 5.0 unlocked phone is not good. Battery stability is only 30-40 minutes. So as new phone it is not up to the mark does not fulfill my demand.,Bad
"I ended up returned the product. I reviewed the phone from local store before I ordered from Amazon. I should be ok with the phone itself of this model. The phone came in unlocked, wi-fi works fine, but having problems connecting to bluetooth earphone. 2.8in screen apparently bit too small. My biggest problem is that this phone appears to be too much like an European returned product dump in US market, as many other reviewers suspected. The phone came in with the seal opened. I understand it has to be opened to unlock, and I have used several unlocked phones ordered from Amazon, this one is the worst. By the way, the return was super convenient, service was excellent.",Bad
"The phone seems to work. It may be ok for a 60 year old, but not for an 80 year old. The menus on it are to complex for someone who just wants to pick up the phone and dial. For example, after a txt msg is received, the user must do something with it (either read, delete or answer no) even before they can make a call.Last, and maybe most important, their customer service is aggravating to say the least. The number we were assigned had been used by a business previously and received many txt msgs and calls. When customer service was contacted they first said they could not change the number unless the calls were harassing. Finally after 15 minutes a level 2 person came on the line and after another 15 minutes they decided they could change the number. By that time I decided to cancel the phone so another 15-20 minutes were spent, and 2 more trips to a supervisor, before they would cancel the non-contract phone.All in all a poor experience for me in setting up the phone and my mother's attempt to use it.",Bad
I can't really say I didn't like it but it would not charge so I returned it and got another cell phone.,Bad
Phone lasted barely 4 months and now will not hold a charge. Ordered a new phone from someone else yesterday.,Bad

"It lasted for one year, as expected for a Blu phone. But, i'm getting a new Blu phone because it's so cheap, one year is enough.",Bad
It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked.,Bad
"Not what i expected. It takes a good while before it recognizes the bt notification installed on the phone. It can make calls and listen music with, i was unable to read whatsapp messages but it reads sms fine.",Bad
"It's nice to look at but too difficult to use , I only use it for the time by using an old sim card",Bad
"Bought this phone during Black Friday 2015, while it was on sale for 199.99 with same day delivery. Hype follows this phone for odd reasons though. This phone's screen is by far the worst thing, with on screen burn-ins from the always present on-screen hotkeys and nav bar on top. It's okay for everyday apps like Facebook, but take a grain of salt that you are destroying your phones screen. The phone overheats after 15 mins of use, too the point where I would have to set my phone somewhere cool to prevent further damage. Charging it from the original box it arrived with charges it at a decent price, if you don't mind burning your hand checking your phone. Other then the burn in on the screen and the overheating, signal drops several times a day, most likely from the overheating while trying to charge my device. It's almost 2017, let's move away from the Nexus brand.",Bad
"Phone resetting itself every once in a little while, frustrating when you need to check email, texts so simply use the phone",Bad
"Bought for $132 phone design is horrible. SD and sim card slot breaks after taking it out one time. Go look at videos for installing a sim on this phone its a joke. The battery is not removable. The screen shows every finger mark. Its slow and the camera is not good either. The only thing good is that it has a full HD resolution (1080), and a large screen. The customer service for Alcatel is disgusting. The guy I was chatting to just simply ignored me, and when I tried to connect to someone who would help me it just kept redirecting me to the same guy. This phone is worth no more than $100. Overall disappointed.",Bad
Nice phone but after a few weeks it started rejecting my sim card. Been through 4 cards and still done the same thing. Nice phone til the sim problem. As far as everything else its a great phone but the sim problem cause me to give it 2 stars OK.,Bad

"Phone was very, very sluggish. Apps froze all the time. Screen is very grainy. GPS (which I use a lot for my job) was all over the place. It seemed to freeze or misread my location often. I'm returning this phone. I've ordered the Lenovo 5.5 phone that has much better specs. It costs $36 more, but money well spent to have phone that can at least work most of the time and handle everyday tasks.Some pros is that it had a nice heavy weight to it. This might not be a pro for you, however.It also came with a nice case and screen protectorsThe biggest pro was the battery life. Of course with a new phone it is always good but this one seemed especially long lasting. Probably because of the huge battery size.",Bad
NOT A SMART PHONE!! we thought we were ordering a smartphone.. and boy were we highly surprised when we found out that this was a MAJOR downgrade,Bad
The phone seems new. Worked exceptional for 1 full week. In the 2nd week I was encountered with network issues as it failed to find any network. Now I'm forced to return the phone,Bad
battery life is a joke stock launcher is bad the phone is a eye catcher the back gets extremely hot the cpu is trash. i will not be buying from blu againi gave the phone 2 stars because well it does work i mean it texts and calls and its pretty and if thats all you want by all means this is your phone,Bad
This phone is cute but just a little bit to small for the average use. Good if you want a really really small phone.,Bad
"I bought it from J&R. I asked for a U.S. version but they sent me a French version. So, no 3G.

Very bad!!",Bad
"At the beginning it seams OK, the touch screen is good... But in a short time we realized it is very very slow, the camera is not good, sometimes it just block, we can't answer a call... My wish is to throw it on the wall! But not until we buy another one. So, it's still serving to it's purpose.",Bad
The phone worked for 1day and then malfunctioned. It cut off and no matter what I did It refused to come back on. Until i googled it and had to press sum nubs together and then it came on. I read alot about it and it seems that Samsung is selling a phone with a known fauth. I am pissed at samsung for this Crap!!!,Bad
"The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are.",Bad
When I talk on the phone it gets very hot in my hand and then after about 3 to 5 minutes it shuts down and I order a battery but I haven't got it yet. I am very disgusted with it because it gets good reception out here but what good is a cell phone if you can't talk on it.,Bad
Just so people know this phone does not have 4g. It is a 3g phone. Verified. It will and cannot do 4g. It will only do H+ which is 3g.,Bad
"Great for basics,call quality is crystal,texting is okay,but for entertainment purposesand apps its downright awful it loads apps really slowly ,youtube takes forever and this version of android is ancient but tolerable.",Bad
"it lasted for about 3 months and all the rubber started to fall off... supposed to be a rugged phone, NOT!!",Bad
"If you need a rear camera do not buy this phone. Camera is blurry, does not focus and horrible pictures.There is no flash which makes the camera useless.",Bad
"When I received the phone, it came in a ziplock bag with a sticker on it, plus the straight talk card. In order to get the phone to work I had to update the phone and spend over an hour on the phone with tech support (in India) and the WiFi still will not work. I expected more.",Bad
"I went from a Apple iPhone 6 to this android so I can use a particular app, which isn't available on the App Store. The phone looks fancy, and has a lot of bells and whistles. But after a couple of days of use, it's really really buggy compared to apple. Apple doesn't do much, but what it does will work every time. This isn't the case for this phone. Its glitchy. You can get a different model of this phone with higher ram, which might help load apps faster, but coming from Apple I hold a simple belief. If you have a app built in, than it should work flawlessly. Apple really abides by this. Anyways for my use of running a single app, it will do. But I would be going backwards if I was to go from an apple to android. Remember, androids bells and whistles sure look shiny and glamorous, but really a bell is hollow and without substance inside.",Bad
"When I bought I chose it from the new phones option.I ordered a new, unlocked 3gs iPhone. This one won't work properly, I can't even do a restart on iTunes!",Bad
Battery was awful. It's like they designed it on purpose to drain down. Last Motorola ever they are just too behind on technology and quality.,Bad
Blackberry does not have any apps. And the camera is not very good. Other then that the actual phone is amazing though! They need to figure out how to get more applications like apple and android do.,Bad
The phone arrived by mail turned on. Other than that the phone is OK. But it just seem weird that the phone arrived ON and the language was already chosen. It was $300+ when I bought it and now its 200. So one star off for that.,Bad
"it stopped working after only having it a week...felt like it was not good quality...ran into issues right away with the phone being able to dial out, black screens and couldnt answer calls",Bad
"Protection wise, I'll give 5 stars. But it's extremely difficult to type with. I've used OtterBox for all of my phones and never had an issue.The screen protected makes it nearly impossible to type with. I have to press twice as hard to hit any key. Even then, sometimes it won't work.I read a similar review about the screen protecter being an absolute pain but like I said, the case itself is great minus the screen protector. I needed a protective case asap for this monster iPhone so I settled with this.I'll end up doing what the other customer did and taking the screen protecter out and putting one that fits properly on the screen.I would have gotten the commuter but it doesn't offer the extra shell that snaps together for full protection.",Bad
"The phone overall is decent. A lot of people that reviewed the phone claim they can get several hours off of one charge. I on the other hand (I've had it a little less than a year now) can only get about 5 hours with moderate use. I usually end up charging the phone twice a day. And this has been the case ever since I got it. Picture quality is definitely great but nowadays the cameras that are coming out, you can get about the same quality. Bottom line, dont get this phone. What's the point of having an amazing camera when its battery will be low all the time?",Bad
"Lots of problems. Can't open attachments, MMS or send pictures. Does not want to sync with my computer to download photo's, and that is just to name a few....",Bad
"When I fist got this phone, I was very excited...I had one a few years ago when they first came out, and I loved it, so I needed another one. The phone was great for the first week or so...then, it would restart by itself, I couldn't answer incoming calls, and people would text me and I wouldn't be able to see the messages or respond. It started off great, then turned sour.",Bad
"***CHECK COVERAGE MAP*** This phone is not 4G LTE, it is 4G wimax. That means in order for me to gain the benefit of 4G I would need to move.",Bad
"The shipment time take too long. When I receive the product, the product is defected. Sometimes it works and sometime is not. Supplier feedback is good. They try to fix problem or refuned to me. I change the setting and it is not stable. What you can said. It is only watch. Not really good for cell phone. I would give supplier positive review, but the product itself is not as good as you thought.GSM Quadband Voice Dialing Watch Cell Phone Unlocked",Bad
The phone has a very poor quality of the conversation (very quiet) and lose the signal! Bluetooth v3.0 compatible handsets and improves the quality of the conversation but playing music on the MP 3/4 player v3.0 resembles the old analog discs!Very cheap phone for fun for kids!,Bad
this phone has never worked properly. att could not get the internet funtion to work and you cant text images. learned a lesson,Bad
It didn't come with a charger and the chargers I have won't work. Also the phone does not work properly,Bad
Every two weeks I have to reset the phone because I can't see anything on the screen.This generally happens when I have made a call lasting over five minutes,Bad
"Just wish I didn't buy it.The phone itself is beautiful with a nice display, but seriously it is very very slow.when I'm home with the wifi, it's a bit slow but OK.but once you go out, it's just unbearable. Can't even download an app, I just have a few and opening them will take forever. And it's not my mobile network cauz everybody else's is good (we're on the same family plan)",Bad
"The product worked great for the first 6 months. After that, the phone started to move slower and slower. After a year, the phone will not power on or charge. Thinking of getting a newer model, but not sure being as though this one did not hold up. Very disappointed.",Bad
"First of all, I am very sad, that the Mobile I buy, it was not according to my requirement.This mobile doesn't works in Pakistan, as it was without Sim.And the seller didn't mentioned there.So it was just useless for me. There must be proper and complete information for every product.",Bad
It just died after a few months and the battery was unreliable lasted no more than 4 hours.,Bad
"the second one we have purchased, both worked fine for couple months, then had terrible trouble with battery in first, and now speaker in second, is going out. Would be different if it was abused, but is not!",Bad
The phone is good but the largest issue is that you cannot save apps or photos or music onto the SD card therefore phone storage is incredibly low.,Bad
"The phone itself it very nice, clean and new. The seller flashed over the factory firmware and it has been causing nothing but problems. The phone constantly resets during calls and will just freeze during normal use. Factory warranty is no good because it's only useable over seas, so now I've got to dish out more cash to have ASUS fix it.",Bad
"It had some issues, but they took it back and refunded my money, so 5 stars for good customer service, but the phone had some issues.",Bad
"If you are looking for a phone that is limited to only making and accepting calls, this can work. Otherwise, you are unable to download any apps, use email or text as the memory is very very limited and the SD card won't help with certain featured that have to be saved to the phone. Also, you can't use Internet without error messages! You only get 1G regardless of the service provider or country.I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a smart phone or needs apps/internet.",Bad
I would like to start by saying that the blackberry priv is very impressive and bring a fresh altenative to todays smart phone options I would 100% recommed this device to anyone with that said lets review the seller.This is not unlocked device comes with att packeging it is att branded phone. The when I called att to try and unlock code it the said that I would have to use there service with the blackberry priv for 6 month before they can unlock it. Now this is not a big deal for me because I am planing on using my BlackBerry as a secondary device so I dont mind using att but I I know that there will be a lot of disappointed customers that will not want waitthe time or use att service for that long the seller should inform buyers of this because ths is false advertising.,Bad
The product is verry good but the sim slot sistem was broken and i need to fix in one phone service,Bad
"This phone was terrible. Difficult to navigate the onscreen menus, difficult to find operating instructions ANYWHERE, and the phone kept locking up when I would receive an email. I finally sent it back for a refund which DID go through no problem. Thanks Amazon!",Bad
"I bought this phone to have two lines, the only thing is you can't have them at the same time. In order to change from one sim to the other you have to reboot the phone, and of course you can only receive calls in the active line. It works fine in Mexico with telcel and movistar.",Bad
"But I got my money after 23 days!!! afterI returned it, I guess one of those damaged item you get once in a while???",Bad
When it arrived the screen was scratched and it wasn't what I thought it would be.,Bad
These phones just keep freezing up all the time. Not reading memory card.Not holding internet connection. will not recommend it to anyone.,Bad
It was refurbished i believe but the speakers didnt work well and when you called someone there was a buzzing sound. Dont waste your money,Bad
"I should have known from the price this phone wasnt worth it. But I figured my cheap ATT go phone couldnt be better, it was (and is).",Bad
"Pretty disappointed to see that the camera is scratched so bad every picture is blurry. LGG3 are bought specifically for the great camera, so make sure you get brand new now like new.",Bad
"For a phone that is only a year, or so, old production wise, it moves about as slow as dial up internet service back in the day. Everything from texting to receiving a call or trying to open an app. I would not recommend this phone to anyone who is use to the speed of a modern phone. I gave it 2 stars just because it worked out of the box.",Bad
Reviews about overheating frequently is true. Someone clearly had this phone before me even though it was advertised as new. It was set to Spanish language and had several downloaded apps. Battery drains much faster than it should for a new phone. Freezes often when switching between apps. I expected more from a new Sony Z5 but it doesn't really act better than my old Z3!,Bad
"I bought this phone as a gift for my teenage son. however upon receiving the phone it appears to be faulty. Instead of touch screen it seems to be ""press screen"" because the screen has to be pressed really hard in order to use it. The phone is constantly freezing. Also, even though i selected NEW ITEM this item does not appear to be a new phone because my son had to delete some items from the phone. I am disappointed and returning this product.",Bad
It didn't meet my expectations that it said new and not refurbished I pay for a new phone not refurbished. The phone is not unlocked like is says.,Bad
This phone is ok it's not the one I had wanted I had wanted the ZTE Max this phone I have now is just a down size from it,Bad
"The phone was advertised as NEW, but was a rebuild. The stylus was missing from the phone. The wrong charging cable was enclosed. The phone requires a (USB to Micro USB) not the (USB to Mini USB) charging cable that was shipped with the order.",Bad
Please do not buy these phones as they will not last long. i bought 3 of them and all of them stop functioning within 3 months of use.,Bad
"I did not feel well, the charger does not arrive, and the team is more deteriorated than described.",Bad
This phone takes WAY too long to simply go from page to page. Things as simple as making a call or wanting to send a text become tests of patience. And it doesn't always go to the screen I want it to go to. I'll go to check a message ad it'll go back to the home page or think I clicked the wrong one. :(((Otherwise I like the setup of the phone,Bad
works satisfactory but charging port di not work at all. as a result I had to buy wall charger and a spare battery,Bad
"Good for music, but not durable at all. 2nd week of owning it, took a 3 foot fall and shattered the glass. No one makes a replacement screen for this specific phone so now I'm back to a shattered phone again",Bad
Sent it to Tmobile and they said it had water damage but it never got wet in my possession! How is it possible to have water damage?,Bad
I bought the phone brand new. And the charger doesn't work. Now am ordering new chargers.,Bad
"Phone I got was REALLY slow and laggy! I hate it compared to the BLU Studio 5.0C HD Quad Core I purchased last year! That phone rocked!! Thought I was buying the same one again, as that what seller showed in photos; however, that is NOT what arrived!",Bad
"We've had a lot of weird problems with the phone. It will randomly reboot, cuts out on conversations despite excellent signal strength and other problems as well. I was certainly hoping for a better experience.",Bad
"It works.... mostly. The speaker is broken so you can't hear the ringer or put someone on speaker to talk. Very disappointing. I just think the seller didn't check the phone out or try to repair the issue before mailing it out. I will have to see if a local repair place can get it fixed.I have another one just like this and love it which is why I bought this one as a second. It's a ""tank"" and works well as an emergency back up phone or as a prepaid phone extremely well. I put it on Verizon prepay plan for $5 at a time.",Bad
The original phone had a much bigger screen. I could of bought a much better phone for the same price.,Bad
My wife is 72 yrs young but not tech savvy. If a manual had been included maybe she wouln't have so much grief trying to use it. I'm 75 yrs old and am now sorry I purchased it for her birthday!,Bad
I received the phone and fell in love with it. However after two week the phone was dead. I tried charging the battery and suddenly the LED light turned red and blinking. I did everything and could not get the phone turn on ever again.,Bad
"I ordered one of these for myself. As soon as I got mine out of the package and booted it up, I ordered one for my husband. This is a very well made phone. The info here does not give it justice. It isn't a cheap lightweight disposable phone and I am amazed at how cheap this was. Excellent instructions in English, most used apps already installed, easy to use voice functions, and everything else is just perfect. Best phone I have ever had.UPDATE: Do not buy!! I was so excited about this phone, so I ordered my husband one. Within 5 days of use, it began to freeze up. I returned his in time, but mine was past the 30 days but the time I had it with this phone. Turns out, it isn't really compatible with T-Mobile and cannot receive 3G coverage. The speak to text lasted about 2 weeks, and after 2 months, most of the screen was unrepsonsive",Bad
The left side of the touch does not work at times. I am going to return it.,Bad
"The item did not appear to be new rather as a phone placed in a box. The battery was too old to hold a charge and the data cable+ power adapter supplied in the original from factory was replaced with a wall adapter only, making it impossible to do data transfer from my computer. The supplier sent the data transfer cable, power wall adapter and two batteries. I paid more money for the new one rather than a refurbished one because I wanted one with the accessories. I have expected the phone to hold its charge better than it did with the new batteries sent. They last only a couple of days per charge now instead of a day or less using it as a phone only--not its full capabilities. I have not set it up to use all its capabilities as of this time.",Bad
"I HAVE BEEN USING THE TREO650 FOR OVER 4 YEARS AND UNFORTUNATELY I COULD NOT FIND A GOOD REPLACEMENT. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND VERY PRACTICAL WITH CLEAR PHOTOS AND SCREEN. I GOT THIS PHONE FROM SINGULAR AND ONCE I HAVE SWITCHED TO T-MOBILE I GOT STUCK WITH THEIR PHONES WHICH I NEVER LIKED. I HAVE UNLOCKED THIS PHONE TO WORK WITH T-MOBILE, BUT AFTER 4 YEARS IT IS WORN OUT. THE REPLACEMENT I GOT IS NOT AS GOOD AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL TREO650 WORK THE SAME, SO YOU HAVE TO BE LUCKY TO GET A GOOD ONE!",Bad
Phone look was brand new. After only one month the phone had a software issue. I advise you if you purchase get the phone checked out.,Bad
"Although the set-up was a breeze, after several weeks I found myself longing for my old flip phone. I'd have to swipe the face five times before getting the ""home page."" Several times the face went blank and I'd have to re-start the phone before I could place a call. Even though I didn't surf the web frequently and used the phone mostly for texting and talking, the battery drained rapidly, requiring charges every two days. When asked to ""tap for a reply"" to a text message, I'd peck away at the bar and no typing keys would appear. When I turned the phone horizontally to use the larger keyboard, the screen often remained vertical, forcing me to use the smaller keyboard.",Bad
"I bought this based on the description that it was new and unlocked, and would work with USA T-mobile simcards (though I was aware that 3G was not supported). It did not work with my USA T-mobile simcard, and to all appearances seemed to still be locked to an Australian network called Telstra. I returned it soon after, and thankfully that process went smoothly.",Bad
"The cellphone has the logo of AT&T, is not unlocked from factory, it has a defect in the camera. It doesn't meet my expectations!!! I regret having purchased this product to this seller, NO WARRANTY, of course, they would not make responsable for this.",Bad
"No text prediction for text messaging, and the audio quality is just okay. But, it's about what you would expect for the price. That said, the battery life is absolutely incredible, and I liked the little flashlight it comes with. However, not good for a day to day phone, but rather for taking on trips so you don't have to worry about losing your nice one.",Bad
"I know I said earlier a excellent phone and it was but, when I finally ordered a sim card to go with phone from sprint, I tried for a whole week to get the phone to activate online, then finally I went to the store and it said phone was reported lost or stolen so I returned it. I also forgot to mention that the phone did NOT come with a charger, which I didn't complain about because I had my Ipad charger for it. But the phone was in excellent condition it might of had a dent but it wasn't that much visible I myself didn't notice till later.",Bad
"Im rating this two stars based more on the battery and inconsistent volume and notifications. I was losing a percentage point of battery every two minutes, basically giving me 3 hours of usage, including standby time. I turned the screen down all the way and that helped a bit, but that made it hard to use the phone outside. Additionally, the volume seemed to stay at one level regardless of whether I adjusted the volume. Furthermore, this phone notifies you of everything all the time. Seriously, you could walk out of and in range of the same wifi network, say at your home, and it would beep and vibrate each time, really annoying. In the end, I just didn't like it, the lumia 640 and moto 3 2015 seem to be better phones at this price range, and the battery last much longer (days compared to hours). Nothing against BLU, I thought the build was nice, and the design appealing, the hardware just wasn't up to snuff with todays competition.",Bad
"Nokia Lumia 920 has too many connectivity issues(3g -4g) , and in my case the phone body has a lose edge.",Bad
"It worked very well for about 4 days then totally died on me. i tried different batteries and everything, it just wouldnt come on.",Bad
"I received this I917 last Friday. Yes, the phone is unlcoked and it works with my T-mobile card. However, I got really disappointed that I couldn't use any applications. everytime i tired to go Marketplace or Xbox to play a game, then I searched online, i tried to upgrade, then it showed this phone can't upgrade. it didn't funtion at all except getting phone calls. Today i found the pictures taken by this phone don't show any on the pictures icon. I thought it would be a good gift for my Christmas. I have to return to find a good one. I would recommend not to buy this phone.",Bad
"The power button does not work, so I can't get updates etc. It is a real pain. I can return it-but then I have no business phone.",Bad
the first phone i got had bad button second what just shut off randomly justthe phones are in bad condition,Bad
"Only one sim port visible, have to switch the sim card, time means that it not s dual as was marketed.",Bad
my walkman function did not work because this phone was too old for my PC(??). I couldn't download or upload any music. It work as a phone until I bought a smart phone though. Thin and light. It was good to carry when I went running.,Bad
"No matter how much the phone looks good, but The EMUI is extremely bad. Especially while calling, we can not end the call and even if we did it the phone shows No calling app running on the phone, but the connection does not break and other end of caller can still listen everything. This happens ever 2 out of 5 times and this a big issue.Some time the screen just freezes and it takes couple of seconds to start working, this happened even while I was settings up the phone for the first time .Other than these, phone is very smooth and camera is excellent and finger print sensor is very quick.",Bad
This phone sucks! I had to send it back because a week after I had it the screen would jump around and it barely charged up..,Bad
Phone battery began overheating just after a month of use. Phone becomes so hot that it cannot be held.,Bad
"I ordered this for my 8 year old to replace her previous very cheap phone. It's main selling point was the price and that I would not have to sign a contract with my cell carrier to add her to my plan. The phone, as described by it's dimensions, is very small. The numeric pad is located in the middle of the the qwerty keypad. My 8 year old likes it, she takes pictures and listens to music sometimes. Primarily used for text messaging with me when she is away from me. Works fine so far, it is just really small and feels really cheap.",Bad
"Phone came in an open AT&T box, not in an original Nokia box. It also has a AT&T logo on it. No warranty or registration paperwork in the box. Very disappointed that this deal was not advertised with these facts (AT&T phone, not an original Nokia equipment). The battery included with the phone is also not original i.e. Nokia, it's a ""no brand"" battery. Awful. Shame on Amazon for marketing these vendors.",Bad
This phone is not real. Fake phone. It still works fine (well it has so far) but it is fakeeee,Bad
"Tried this phone with consumer cellular. Don't know if it was the phoneor signal, but ended up could not use this phone with that service. Evenwhen it showed a strong signal, could not get incoming calls nor call out, orit worked very rarely. Text msgs fine, no problems. Even could notget into voice mail.",Bad
"Woke up after using May 1 - Sept 1 the screen was black and unresponsive. Samsung wouldn't cover warranty because it was an international phone. They said if it was an American model they could help me. So what Samsung is saying that only American products are worth guaranteeing? Seriously I paid $700 for this phone! Samsung said DeltaMobiles is the company who sold me the phone and I need to contact them. So what you made the crappy phone, Samsung! Wish I would have stayed with Iphone!",Bad
"For this price, it's a great value. It does almost all that my girlfriend's iPhone 4s does, and more. It is not as fast and responsive as the iPhone, the camera and the sound are also not as good, but it does the job. The screen size is identical to the iPhone, and the screen resolution seems to be the same. I installed a lot of apps on it, and so far have not run out of memory (unlike with my previous phone that had Android 2.3 on it). It came with Android 4.0, and recently was updated to 4.1. So far I have not found any use of the dual SIM card capability, but it could come handy on my next European trip if I buy a local SIM card there. That's the way to save on phone bills while overseas. Highly recommended.After a few months of use, I change my mind about this phone. Too slow. I hate it now. I bought a Nokia Lumia 635 instead. Much better.",Bad
"I give this a 2 star only because I liked the large screen. Other than this, the performance was absolutely horrible (more than 10x slower than any Samsung or LG). You have to have an extraordinary amount of patience to use this phone. Additionally, the screen cracked while in my front pocket within 6 months of ownership since there aren't any real protective cases to put this thing in. As I haven't been able to find a replacement screen through BLU, coupled with the fact that I simply could no longer stand the pitiful performance, I had to get a new phone.",Bad
"It's a strong 2, I got it for the camera. It's works very well. Windows sucks real bad compared to Android. To bad they can't put out a product like Android.",Bad
i only used the phone for four months and it is mal-fuctioning. the phone has no warranty on it because i took it to the apple store and it says out of warranty so how can i get a replacement. it is really annoying.,Bad
This phone is amazing but Blu Phones dont last long. It's now June any my charger port is not working. I emailed blu to replace it and they require information not given to you when you purchase the phone so I'm stuck with a non charger $350 that didn't last a year,Bad
Fast delivery for sure but I am so disappointed about the phone. I have had it for less than 2 months now and the phone's tactile screen does not work. this is quite frustrating. I can't turn it of to restart not change screens,Bad
"Bought this phone in november got it late and the box was half emptyall that was in the box was the phone and the battery NO headset,No usb cable,No user manual .The phone works great but I will never purchase any thing from this vendor again.",Bad
The Battery discharged in minutes even if is on stand by. I can not understand why this happen if I charged correctly the very first time. Can I use the warranty for This?,Bad
I had to return the item because my T-Mobile provider rejected it for an outstanding balance on the phone I received.,Bad
Do the phone has a app store in the phone because i need it for downloads for business purpose thanks,Bad
"I was expecting an iPhone 4S 16GB as the seller advertised, however, I received an iPhone 4 8GB. I was very displeased. I did not want to return it because I was going out of town during that time and returning it would have been a huge pain. However, the device I received worked perfect and although it was not what I expected, it sold it to my friend and got some of the money back. I had a horrible experience, and I do not know why they advertise something that is not true.",Bad
"These things are super cool. They're cheap, they're android, and if you don't expect much you definitely won't be disappointed. So why then only 2*s? I've had to replace it once already because of dead pixels out of the box and here I am a week later with the replacement phone, dead pixels.It's not just one or two, it's a good chunk of the screen.",Bad
The phone would not accept a SIM card for the carrier and couldn't be programmed.,Bad
"Shipping errorsInformation is Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version - 4G / LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800/2600/900/800 MHz) (New), in fact, it is Verizon SQN100-2, LTE 13, 4 , CDMA 1xRTT / EVDO Rev A (800/1900 MHz), and, within the battery compartment, no blackberry security tags, printing fuzzy, suspected to be refurbished.",Bad
"I bought this because all of the reviews said that it was a quality made case. I actually ended up not buying the iPhone 7 plus because they were backordered on release day, so I planned on exchanging this. However, I was really disappointed with the quality of the case. The leather felt cheap, the seams where the wool and tpu meet were uneven and the wool was fraying. It was really difficult to get cards in and out of the slot, which is a good thing in some ways but it was more than just secure-- I felt like I needed long fingernails to get it out. I decided I would return it because of the waulity, but they tried to make me pay for shipping. Ridiculous if you ask me!",Bad
This was not new. The bottom screws came right out. They're supposed to be epoxied into place and inside one of the screws holding the ribbon cable in place for the battery was just floating around. This was more like a bad refurbish job. Worked for two years which was good. Two stars though for the price. For over $300 it should have worked for three or more.,Bad
Cheap phone. Backlight turns off in 10 seconds. Back cover falls off easily. Difficult to navigate from one function to another. Hardly a smartphone. Next to NO apps available for this phone. None that are useful that is.,Bad
Liked that is was rooted but the camera will not work right out of the box. Tried installing other camera they too failed to work.,Bad
"Call quality is pretty awful. Gave it to my daughter and have noticed that my data, standing right next to her and on the same network (AT&T), will be totally fine and I'll have to turn my phone into a hotspot for her due to awful reception. Needs to be restarted frequently for freezing issues. Very glitchy UI.I only bought this because it said there would soon after be an update to 6.0.... 10 months later and it's still running the craptacular 5.x (whatever it shipped with). I notice there's no mention of it being updated anymore. Shame, it could have been an awesome phone.",Bad
"They don't give you the sim card and your phone will not work correctly without it. They make you buy the SIM card separate, in order to get more money! I had to take my phone into the Sprint store in order for it to work correctly. They were very generous and gave me a SIM card for free after they had to deactivate the SIM card the phone originally came with and activate a new one. Next time I would go directly through the phone carrier.",Bad
I got this phone less than a week on monday.and i find out it frezzes up sometimes when making calls i hit the call button but it does not call also typing messages i hit the key but it dont write my message. Us really fuastrating. Anyone know what i can do,Bad
"Very nice phone everything was working well but after a reset from an update it went south real fast. The data does not connect to the T Mobile network, then all my Google apps disappeared, and now the phone says that my region is not supported and even when trying to open YouTube from the browser through the WiFi connection a message of network error shows on the screen, thankfully all my Amazon apps work beautifully, shame I can't use my data plan to use them they only work over WiFi.",Bad
...so I1) must remove the battery from the phone to charge it and I2) must load data onto the phone by saving it onto a micro SD card then putting the card into the phone.The phone as a phone works great and the apps work very well.The phone was unlocked as promised.,Bad
"I disliked the phone because they sent me an unlocked international version, instead of a united states version. Major difference being the international version is supported be samsung U.K. only., not samsung U.S.A. Also international version does not com with the stylus pen. Third the instructions R in French.",Bad
"very bad performance on the camera as sometimes it is not available throwing an error, the phone overheats a lot and also it turns off suddenly very often, the design is good but dissapointed about how it fails. even when is new",Bad
The phone looked brand new but the front camera in the phone did not work. It was dark. So it was returned 2 days ago.,Bad
"This is a great phone, however I think the seller should add in the description the bands this phone uses for 2G, 3G and LTE",Bad
"Pros:CheapLarge screenSD card slotDual SIM, if that's your thingCan be disassembled, because it has Phillips screws instead of stupid Torx or Pentalobe or whatever screwsCons:Sketchy QCPoor cameraFront camera isn't sealed against dust--it quickly becomes unusableHeadphone jack makes buzzing noise with Apple EarpodsBootup sound cannot be turned offExtremely low RAM and ROM space (512MB and <1GB)When I got it, the GPS did not work, and it has never worked, even though this device supposedly has GPS. Also, RAM is too low to run many apps in the background (esp. Facebook, which I uninstalled because of its ridiculous RAM usage). ROM is poor too, and it was strangely split up between two partitions, making much of it useless because user data can go to SD, but not all of the app can do so.",Bad
"verykool s5017 Dorado 4G HSPA+ 5.0"" IPS LCD...the battery lasts about 2 or 3 hours. I sent an email to the company about a month ago with no response. And the user manual doesn't help much. I do regret buying this phone. I wish I could send it back.",Bad
"I'm not totally pleased! not bring headphones and the charger does not work for the US, is charger for Europe! I hope it does not burn as they use different power to charge!.. if they change the 2 chargers for Americans, I can give them the highest score. otherwise no!",Bad
This phone was ok at first but it's soooooo slow! You have to wait like a good 10 to 15 seconds when trying to open an app which is way too long in my opinion. Apps should open in like 2 seconds. If someone texted me a picture I was never able to see what they sent me and I couldn't send picture texts either. But if I switched my SIM to another phone my picture texting was fine so it was just this phone. I just stopped using it unfortunately and went back to my old phone which sucks. I wouldn't recommend.,Bad
Got phone for my dad.Earpiece failed after a few days.UI is very laggy. And no update anytime soon to os.,Bad
"Within a few days , gallery crashed. I reset the phone, worked for a few days, then it crashed again.This phone is a hot mess.Told my siblings do not buy please, please.",Bad
I like the phone but it just didn't have enough features as it should for how new it was. Could've been much better. If I we're you I'd research and pick another phone,Bad

"The phone looks good for it's price point, but it is kind of tiny.The bad thing about this phone is it has very choppy communication. It drops the voice every few seconds. The line isn't disconnected, but the voice between the conversation just disappears and comes back. Forcing the need to constantly repeat oneself.",Bad
The battery life is horrible it does not hold charge! IT is constantly freezing!! not worth it,Bad
the screen cover is way too thick and does not lie flat on the screen therefore not making it easy to use. the colour i received was not as depicted on the site. overall i was disaapointed,Bad
I really like this phone BUT it turns off by itself & the only way I can turn it back on is if I take the battery out then put it back in. It moves very slow & this phone goes dead entirely too quick. Thinking about returning this phone asap.,Bad
"Always overheating device, and sometimes the device stuck and freeze, and The device too heavy. But the good thing the camera.",Bad
The phon e not working properly the screen keeps jumping and freezing up very annoying. I never have problem with amazon bef ore until now,Bad
This phone was more useful as a weapon to mash someone's face in. It gave more problems than a Chrysler with 300k miles.,Bad
PHONE IS VERY GOOD BUT NOT WATER RESISTANT Mine is SURMERGI WATER AND DAMAGES I recommend NOT SUMERGUIRLO,Bad
"I **Loved** this phone. It was perfect for what I needed. I received it two days ago.On day 1, after working properly for hours, the screen went to white. I could do nothing with the phone. After several battery pulls and reboots, I finally got it to turn on. I thought it was a fluke, as the remainder of the day, the phone worked as promised. Excellent excellent feature phone.Fast forward to this morning. The phone randomly rebooted to the white screen again - except this time, I could not get it to turn back on properly. I'm very disappointed! I dropped it off at UPS already for a return. After doing so, I searched online and found the ""white screen"" issue is a problem with this model. :-(Again, this was a perfect feature phone for me and I wish I could've kept it. Sadly, it had to go back.",Bad
"Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died. Constant lockups, requiring the removal of the battery to reboot even after doing a firmware update, made me return this to amazon. Will wait for the new sony.",Bad
"After using a smart phone, this phone is almost impossible to get used to. I had to go with a basic phone for now, and there isn't much phones out there without internet capablilities. Don't like it. Can't wait to start using my Samsung Vibant again. Phone is so out dated! key board is nice, but hard to get contacts up on it to text to. Phone book is very basic, can't see any type of memory for calls, unless made for that day. Good luck with it, I had none, just use the phone for emergency use only now.",Bad
Mine turned out to be a lemon; it quit working on the 30th day of use - on the day my free replacement warranty expired. Samsung refused to repair or replace it because they said it had moisture damage. I don't know how that could have happened.,Bad
This phone cannot send or receive picture text. Its a product problem according to all users of this phone.,Bad
"One of the speakers (right side) is not working, not good support from the seller. Sometimes the phone shut down when using wi-fi, even when battery is above 70%.",Bad
The htc freestyle is a very attractive and affordable phone but freezes and shuts off out of no where and the battery must be removed to restart it... The music player brings the phone to its knees. Good for texting but so is any other phone with a qwerty keyboard,Bad
The phone had great features but I could not get picture messages or group messages nor could I send them.I have had the phone for a few months and now my battery does not last within the day even when I am not using it. I would not buy this phone,Bad
No as good as I expected... it is OK ... but definitely not a go,Bad
"Disappointed! No instructions.... Purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very ""tech"" smart and they weren't sure what to do because there wasn't a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-(",Bad
The touchscreen did not work at all when I first got the phone. The screen did work for a short time before malfunctioning again. The supplier is sending me a new phone so maybe this one will actually work.,Bad
"This phone shuts down often in the middle of my correspondence, or when I am viewing a page. Also, Ihave not been able to send or receive pictures in my messages. I would simply like to trade it for another phone.",Bad
When I recived this phone it had scrached camera lense and it was damaged in the top right corner.,Bad
I got this as an easter gift and the LCD was broken and there was a little chip in the glass under the plastic when I opend the box. I'm in the process of returning the device and hopefully order a new one that isn't broken..,Bad
"Phone is looking good, smart phone it has everything, but I don't like it, this phone many time frezzz on me.",Bad
Temporary Phone Not Worth it for daily use at all!!!!!I gave it 2' stars because it does work for a few hours.1. T-Mobile is suggested2. SIM card must be compatible3. SD Memory card is suggested*Overall I'm quite disappointed!No standby; battery drain very quickly. The charge is slower. For me this is just a temporary solution for when I go overseas. *Warning: phone will overheat while chargin . Best to power off device!,Bad
I never get the phone unlocked I had to spend another money aside to unlock,Bad
It turned out to be a much older and less flexible phone than I already had. The OS was appallingly outdated. It was so small I couldn't begin to use the keyboard.,Bad
"I bought this phone September 21st and finally got it on the 30th. I was looking forward to it so much and couldn't wait to learn all the new and interesting features about it. But instead, I'm pretty disappointed and considering returning it.First I'd like to mention the problems I'm having with this phone.1- It freezes and it freezes constantly. When I'm listening to Spotify and when I'm using snapchat, sometimes it even kicks me off when my music is playing and I have to open my apps again. Also, it takes a while for my Spotify app to open.2-Pictures come out pixelated. One of the features about this phone that caught my attention was the quality of the camera. It had more to it than the asus zenphone which I wanted originally and probably should've just bought that one.3- The volume is very low. I've already modified the volume in settings and it doesn't help.Overall, I'm not impressed with this phone.",Bad
"Very useless ""smartwatch."" Would consider saving a little more and buying something more like a real smart watch. I used it for about a week and decided to storage it forever. Also headset wire was broken. Think twice before getting it!",Bad
Came slowly 7 days. But seems to work. Phone was Cingular but working fine with att go phone sim. Decent shape for the age of the phone and made my finance happy. Would have rated a five if I could have selected faster shipping \ been prime eligible\ Anyways seems to be work the 26 bucks. Mind you its only been in use today. Oh ya and came with charger and charged a plus. This phone takes the old style USB you know the phat one......... So have down graded my review because after 2 days of use the battery life was very noticeably limited to two hours or less. The phone now will not hold a charge at all. Granted a new battery on amazon is around. 5 dollars. Low and behold this phone lasted around two weeks even the charger died. I believe that it was wet a one point further inspection the battery was new not original and the little water sticker is missing. Battery is fine long as charge in a different phone. Wouldn't buy from passport again.,Bad
the truth that I did not like much that I sent one of meno gb internal memiroa gets hotter than an oven is not what you expected I am very desecionado product,Bad
It was scratched and Apple emblem was with defects. And the color was nor the same as my new iPad gold. Also memory 12 Gb instead of 16 GbBut not so bad for the price payed for refurbished phone. And it works well with Uzbekistan network,Bad
Gone after 8months of usage. Not able to start. It overheats if we use LTE/Wifi 3-4hrs a day. then after a week starts booting itself and after some it can even come up. Scarp,Bad
"Just after the ability to send it back expired...the phone started to malfunction and is getting progressively worse (it is less than 6 months old). Too many issues to list all. If you can, buy another phone!",Bad
It had a cheap look. It was very light. It wasn't for me so I returned it.,Bad
"Purchased the phone 8-9-15. Decent phone, especially for the money. No complaints until the microphone died. Followed the RMA process - worked fine. Good communication from BLU. Here is the issue: The mic died in about 4 months. I was offered a refurbished replacement in white (my phone was black). First, I do not think I should be offered a refurbished phone when their equipment quit working and so quickly, maybe if the warranty was almost up. It is in their warranty policy to be able to replace defective products with rebuilt, reconditioned, or new products, but really? Second, I purchased a black phone, don't offer me a white phone. I would have originally purchased a white phone if that is what I wanted.Overall, I liked the phone but I am definitely not happy with their warranty policy and giving me a refurbished replacement in a different color. I doubt I would buy another because of this.",Bad
"I ordered this phone a few weeks ago..couldn't pick it up till yesterday..charged it and inserted the Windmobile sim card today , hoping to be able to use it... only to have it showing Wind away...what a bummer...I can't use it now...phone looks good..but unfortunately...no chance of using it...what a disappointment...",Bad
"Now anytime there is ""black or gray"" the screen fizzles and looks what i called spotted i dont thing you can fix it without replacing whole phone. Ither than the fact that it cant system update its lol ok personally this phone is a major upgrade but overall its not really refurbished and i had to get its APN fixed at T-Mobile cause the phone had none.",Bad
"I have heard really great things about the Nokia N9 since my fiance is from the middle east, so I decided to get one. But I was really disappointed that you can not get a lot of apps like you can on the android phone. The camera and the GPS on this phone are amazing, if it would get all the apps that android has like whatsup app, instagram etc then it would be a perfect phone for me.",Bad
"Perhaps my expectations were too high when I bought this phone. It's okay if you don't plan to add Apps and have too many contacts. In my case when I synchronized with my Outlook contacts, which is big, the phone froze, so I had to delete it all. Together with this phone I received a Sony SmartWatch2, however this phone only accepts a few of the Apps developed for this watch. If you plan to use this dual SIM Card phone, just as a plain phone, go ahead, it will be okay. If you plan to use is as a smartphone look for a higher end device.",Bad
"I just bought 2 of these but returning it....The reason being is that the UI lacks and does not respond sometimes to commands, especially the back button, there is serious issue with the back button, it does not respond. I love the phone other wise. it heats up sometimes a lot as well. The camera is great but it does lack on responding to some commands sometimes and there is a delay. sending it back to Amazon today.",Bad
They gave me a broken one doesn't the speaker doesn't work and its very slow I don't .,Bad
"I REALLY wanted to like this phone. It has so many good reviews! I've only been using the phone 10 days. However, it randomly reboots, freezes, and instead of playing Pandora through Bluetooth in my car, it will occasionally play a recorded phone call INSTEAD! And the battery life isn't so great either, if I don't charge it midday it's dead by night. And that's with moderate use. I would expect some issues to pop up after at least 6 months of using the phone. But it did it's first reboot on the 4th day. Totally unacceptable for a new phone. I'm so disappointed! Hopefully I won't have any issues returning it.",Bad
Wasn't very satisfied with this purchase. Bought it as a gift for my mother to use in Colombia during her trips. I'm glad I tested out the phone before giving it to her. When i plugged it in to charge the phone wouldn't light up. At first I just took it as the battery being completely drained so i left it for a few hours. At some point the phone's screen showed a red X over an empty battery which usually indicates a defective battery. The battery i received with the phone was all scratched up and clearly used. Returned it right away. If you're going to include refurb parts at least make sure they function properly. I'm just glad i have enough time to buy a phone somewhere else.,Bad
The back camera not showing. The torch light not working and the seller is mute about this even with a message sent to him. Amazon should question this guy,Bad
"It came brand new with 2 mini styluses and 2 other phone accessories that i believe you wrap headphones around. The phone is pretty decent but i've been having problems with the volume buttons (sometimes they just don't work) and when I watch videos the screen flickers with different hues of color on screen (only happens with videos). Plus when I'm in calls the person on the other end always hears an echo or strange noise from my mic and when I type they hear the sound of the vibration touch on the keyboard which I still haven't figured out how/or if I can turn off. Going to just buy a Bluetooth for it. Other than these annoying points, the phone is pretty good. I bought it because I needed a phone with a better app store than windows and I really liked the look of it abd it's specs. I just wish it didn't have these annoying problems with it.",Bad
"Was advertised as new,but the screen was coming up on top left corner, the phone I liked,it was defected.",Bad
"compre 2 de estos telefonos y ambos vinieron con problemas, tuve que enviarlos a reparar a una tienda especializada, muy inconforme con esto",Bad
"I wasted money on this phone. They sent me one that didn't work and when I told them, they FedExed another phone in a different color that worked, but it was annoying (and now I have a phone in a different color than I chose and wanted. The lady at Verizon laughed that I paid so much for this phone.",Bad
"Crashes all the time, doesn't have a front camera, slow. A full charge lasts about three to four hours. Two stars because I like the keyboard. This really is a terrible phone though. I wouldn't even give it to a child. There's a reason it was discontinued in 2010.",Bad
"After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",Bad
"So I bought this ""unlocked"" phone to give to my mom who speaks spanish. We have had multiple technitians look at the phone and we have been unable to set the phone's language to spanish. It ended up in a drawer... what phones don't have multiple languages these days???? really????",Bad
"Does not come with 8 Gyga card, stead 4 Gyga. Careful for the same price one can buy the C6 which is much better. I discovered it one day after I bought but the return fees from the seller would make it 50 U$ more expensive, so I decided to keep it.",Bad
"Although phone states unlocked; not compatiable with Sprint. Additionally, everything was in Spanish when powered on.",Bad
not to bad once you play with it a bit. i got it to use as an mp3 player well working around the house that i wont need head phones for and play via a blue tooth speaker. it wont sync and also i have to get a new bar for the watch band witch came (new today still in box) broken,Bad
it says T-Mobile compatible; however my sim card once inserted didn't connect at all. it would say sim not connecting to network. great price but I couldn't do nothing more then use the phone when Wi-Fi was avail. no calling out services when away from home. over all the phone was cute. but needed it for me then apps at home.,Bad

"For some reason I continue to buy Huawei almost like I am a glutton for punishment.Let me be clear,If you can afford an Iphone then get an Iphone.If you rather not buy an Iphone then know that Huawei does provide a good quality phone for the price.To sum it up,This phone is slow and it sticks. So... awwww",Bad
"I was originally pleased, with this purchase. However, in less than a months time, I started to have charging issues. Then it began pulsing( ???) on and off. This is when it is just sitting on the table. Possessed !? Finally it stopped charging. I know that this is not the normal performance of Samsung Galaxy phones and I will buy another one soon.",Bad
"When I put a sim cards on the phone, I keep receiving mails from of vendors I never subscribed for. I guess the phone has been used before. There days I received up to 40 mails that originate from the US, it's becoming a nuisance and can't turn them off.",Bad

"I bought two of these phones.They seem like nice phones, so my dad also purchased one. Well dad's acted up within a couple of months and now one of the two I purchase will no longer charge after only 7 months. I had the battery , the charger, and cable tested ... It is the phone. I was going to try the warrant, but I have been reading that they require you to pay to sent it in.Rather than throwing away more cash I will pick up a known band.1 survivor out of 3 is not a good personal experience.",Bad
"Very bad ! Two SIM card only one work. But only this , when I talking suddenly shutdown . And lot my friend complaint can't reach me . Check the phone dead itself. And I in china , when I came back from China , the seller talk me I can't return or exchange or fix it , because it expires from purchase day. Only 7 days delay , before that I was in China, how I deal that.",Bad
The phone just always randomly cuts off or just goes to a white screen. People has a hard time hearing me now and i cant get 3g on it.,Bad
"Phone cracks very easily, after first crack the bottom half stopped working. The first 4 days I had it the speakers didnt work so I had to factory reset it. Other than those problems, I really like the phone. Gets what I need done and the camera was great when I could use it.",Bad
I gave it a 3 star because for the day I had it it was going great..but it is way tooo slowwww....u click something and wait seconds for it to open up..and there were not a lot of apps..smh....it was crazy,Bad
I bought this cellphone thinking that I would be able to use my At&t sim in it.I could but only for txt and making calls.The phone is NOT FULLY UNLOCKED so you wont be able to use At&t 3G.I'm returning the device.,Bad
The refurbished model is definitely not as good as the new model I had previously. It works but definitely doesn't have the same amount of juice.,Bad
"The unit is ""OWNED"" by another carrier. When I called my carrier(NEXTEL/SPRINT) to find out why I cant text ,this is what I was told. They stated there was nothing that i can do to get this to work!!",Bad

"I bought this phone June of last year and it worked really well with only a few times a month the screen wouldn't turn on and you'd have to restart the phone (you can hear messages coming in but can't bring the phone out of sleep mode). Now, a little over 7 months later, this annoying screen problem happens all the time, the phone completely wiped out all of my contacts, it keeps saying the SD card is being removed when it isn't, and apps will just not function properly. I thought it was a tremendous buy at the beginning but looking at the fact that I have to now buy another phone, it would've been cheaper to invest a bit more on a good and reputable phone.",Bad
We bought this phone new. Had it about 5 months and it wont charge a battery. Tried different outlets and chargers and it will not charge.,Bad
"Excellent phone, no problems with it; but the package was a shame...They sent an European charger without the adapter so I had to buy one by my self, and the main failure was that the phone arrived WITH OUT THE HEADPHONES!!!So in the end the phone is great, but the accessories where all wrong, I was in the USA only for vacations so now I don't know how to complain to get them.",Bad

"The mini came used(exactly how I ordered it), with an after market charger. I noticed right away that the charger was a tight fit in the charging port on the phone and when I took pictures they would come out with colored spots. Well because I needed to use the phone and didnt have time to send it back I swapped out the camera with a spare mini I had and the pictures appear normal (no color spots) As for the charger I use it on other android devices ( as it seem to fit better).",Bad

"I loved the phone to the start when i got it but the wifi on it is old school. It's incompatible with any security type login wifi version and thus, i'm returning it for an android type phone (Galaxy 3).

I wonder as is the procedure in such cases, if necessary forwarding phones and which direction.Thanking the prompt response to the problems that I present, I say goodbye.Gaudys Fermin.",Bad
El equipo salio defectuoso. El trackpad funcional con dificultad. Debo llevarlo a reparar. No me siento muy satisfecho por la compra. de esta manera no lo recomiendo.,Bad
"I will say i bought a used phone.But, the phone i received was in horrible condition.i paid way more then what this product is worth.I received the phone expecting some scratched and nicks here and there which was fine because it is used.But the phone does not even work like a phone should work! the earpiece speaker is messed up and i cannot here anything when anybody calls! if i cant make phone calls, then there is no point in having a phone and i might as well just get a tablet.If you buy a used iPhone 4s from this seller, maybe your luck will be different and you may get one in better condition, but be advised that this seller is not guaranteeing a fully functional phone.",Bad

"Very, very minimal space. Maybe good for someone who needs to get the child a first time phone. Not good for more experience users.",Bad
Not a user friendly phone at all. When you call someone it will call the back several times. This has happened to at least 5 different people who used the phone. It has very short battery life. Phone heats up if you talk more then 5 minutes . Carry your charger wherever you go.it doesn't have a quick search for contacts. Don't buy this phone unless you're desperate like I was . I have no other phone so I can't even return it. I used to think when I ordered anything from. Amazon it would be decent . I don't feel like that anymore . What's happening to you amazon.,Bad
"I really like the size and shape. I wear the phone on a lanyard around my neck. Very handy. Unfortunately there is no documentation. It was supposed to be on line but the phone is so old, Motorola has discontinued it. I have a lot of trouble using the phone. I can't retrieve voicemail messages of turn the ringer back on after I turned it off.",Bad
the heavy black back part of the case blocked the lens. unable to take photos. Discarded and used just the front piece.,Bad
"4g internal, what they failed to mention is that most of that is used by OS. some games have to be downloaded to internal then can be moved over to SD card. so good global phone the apps I wanted could not be put on it. wish I would have done more research and got something better.",Bad
At the beggining it was good but in a couple of weeks turned really slow and the worst thing is that it losts the signal and sometimes the phone doesnt load websites or apps even with WiFi. I have to restart it at least 3 times a day in order yo solve these problems,Bad
"Decent midrange phone for its price. Camera is horrible (3.0 mp) and build quality is really cheap. Battery doesn't last long, and proprietary samsung software (touchwiz) takes up most of the ram, so even after rooting, you only have like 100mb. Still, its very cheap for a prepaid android phone with midrange specs. Comes with alot of bloatware, so rooting is recommended.edit: phone stopped working a week after 1 year of use. No physical damage, looks brand new, but stuck in a boot loop. Data reset to factory conditions did not help, nor did reinstalling the firmware. Phone works for about 10 minutes, then resets.",Bad
The phone is slow and the camera is very blurry when taking pictures. Over then that the phone is good. And the shipping was really fast.,Bad
Every thing is great except that you guys sent me through wrong charger can you please send me the galaxy s5 charger and I'll return the android charger you sent me back thanks in advance,Bad
Cool phone but you cannot upgrade to the latest versions of windows which means most apps are not available. Do not buy if you want a phone that is updateable and versatile,Bad

"The GPS module is defective. I have tried contact with the supplier, but I haven't received an answer.",Bad
The phone is ok...No speaker which is important to me (I should have checked). The battery life is horrible. It's good enough for my 10 year old.I would have liked more information on the quality of this product,Bad
Phone keeps shutting off while in the middle of doing things with it very agarvating. Not working very good . Phone does look brand new with original box just doesn't work very well and also stats it was boost and wasn't had to pay extra to flash over to boost not happy at all,Bad
"This phone only lasted 9 months. When I contacted the seller all they could say to me was - ""Unfortunately our phones are used and don't come with any warranty, just a 30 day money back return policy. Unfortunately the time frame has passed. My apologies."" I guess you get what you pay for. The entire audio portion of the phone died. All you could hear was crackle noise until it got to the point that you heard nothing. Doesn't give me a lot of confidence in ""This device has been extensively tested, is fully functional, and ready for activation.""",Bad
This watch is aesthetically pleasing however the sound is just horrible. you need complete and utter silence to hear the person on the other end using speaker. it sucks!,Bad
"I am really disappointed with my phone. The front camera is not working well, has really a lot lot lot lot of color dots that make impossible to see the image so I can't take selfies or use the camera for skype. The SMS module doesn't work. I record my voice and when I try to listen to it it has no volume; I can listen to anything sent to me but not redorded by me so I think the speakers are OK but the mic is damaged. My niece also buyed the same phone and has problems with the mic too.",Bad
I have poor experience with this phone because it won't charge the battery. I have this same phone but the battery is bad and the pixels are not doing well. Have had it for years and really like this phone. The battery from the new phone charged well in the old phone and it worked in the new phone. But if it won't charge in the new phone then there is something wrong with the Remanufactacturing process.,Bad
I was terribly disappointed with the packaging of the device. It also says the device is new but the one I got looks used. The box was opened and not shut properly. And the packaging was terrible and held together by a thin piece of clear tape .,Bad
"Well...I would give this phone 5 stars but....I bought it back in March and now the charging area is barely taking charge...it has to be laying a certain way to charge , I have bought two new chargers and it is still not working very well...so now my phone barely charges.",Bad
"Receive phone in reasonable time, but when emailed vendor to ask for shipping schedule received very vague answer, and did not get answer to question. Almost decided to cancel order, but then a few days later received the phone with all that was mentioned in product description. Phone was dirty, it looked like someone stripped a couple of screws in battery compartment, probably to give the impression that the unit was refurbished, which is not possible to confirm unless you are a technician to open it up and view it apart. I had to disinfect it a couple of times with wipe, due to all the dirt on it an oily residue both inside and out. Unit is working OK, but battery is not lasting as long as expected. Not worth the trouble to send it back and wait for another phone, needed it for an emergency that came up when previous phone's screen suddenly stopped working. I'll update this later after a couple of months.",Bad
the computer does not say his name at the top of the battery that is not saying samsung galaxy mini s5 . As featured a picture,Bad
"Battery does not last long at all, when using the phone to do emails or look stuff up the phone gets hot and shuts down. Very disappointing!! Already had to buy a different phone",Bad
"I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time.",Bad
I bought it little over a year ago and the screen touch started to fail in some parts I do not know what to do,Bad
Item looks and feels fake....get from known carrier! The original has no logo on the top right corner this one does....like most knock offs do....be smart and buy it form a local retailer,Bad
I've had this phone for about a month I accidentally dropped it and the screen is cracked with the protective cover. If you like those big phones then that's right phone for you. Personally i like being able to operate a cell phone with one hand ...not this phone it's almost impossible to text with just one hand... But overall it takes good pics there are plenty of internal memory... Another negative thing about this phone I like the voice text feature but when you use it sometimes it prompt you to tap the screen again in order talk and if that wasn't bad enough you have to tap that little tiny keyboard icon on the screen to get it back to the normal text screen...,Bad
"Had nothing but trouble with this phone, audio not functioning properly. However, as it turned out, part of problem may have been due to something I did wrong (covering speaker with plastic cover). I also had very poor reception and was not able to be overheard when I made some calls. I did not begin using till I had for over 4 weeks, but luckily amazon is going to accept back and give me money back.",Bad
"Very scuffed on both screens, outside screen and keypad looks like they were coming off and the charger they included would NEVER work for this model, but a current android...and this was advertised like new...",Bad
Had this less than a month and it wouldn't let me open my apps or type anything.,Bad
"I work at a factory so this phone was a good choice considering if I dropped it, it would land on concrete. Only the first time I dropped it the internal screen cracked and the phone what closed... It also would not recognize that it had an SD card in it.",Bad
"Chinese or Korean product not described in the description,The phone is new and delivered with a new box too",Bad
"This phone have no flash for camera and it does not keep the battery charged for very long, it goes dead quickly and takes a long time to charge.",Bad
"The screen on my P8 Lite broke after one day of use, two bubbles appeared on the screen. I was very surprised, considering Huawei is promoting the screen on this device, specifically. Phone was never dropped and never hit anything. Very poor first impression. Wound up getting an LG G4 instead.",Bad
"battery barely makes it to lunchtime when i use this for workmight be waterproof when it comes out the box, but the cover for the charging port doesn't last over timegood camera though",Bad
The add said NEW and what i recieved was very far from new the screen was scratched and the back of the phone was very warn out and faded. It came with peoples phone numbers and pictures in the phone. I would not have purchased this phone if I was told it would look the way it did. And if you do sell used phones you should atleast factory reset the phone and clear out other peoples personal information.,Bad
"it was said its unlocked phone, but now i see it locked. doesnt work without any carrier except t mobile.",Bad
"I loved many features about this phone, but the one thing that doesn't work is multi media messaging. My grandma cannot receive images via text. That was very important to her so we can't use it. I'm on the search for a phone that has the same qualities. Big buttons, non-flip cause she lacks the dexterity to answer before hang up, pictures of her main contacts so she can make a call by just hitting a photo pic, but it has to be able to receive photos via text and archive those photos.",Bad
"I don't know whether my problems with this phone are due to the design of it or the fact that it was refurbished, but it has a lot of issues.The screen has a lot of problems. It's slow when you swipe it at any time, doesn't pick up your keystrokes unless you go slow, and often it just locks up completely and becomes totally unresponsive. The only thing you can do is turn off the screen and turn it on again.The phone, itself is actually really cool. It has a lot of ROM space, a big screen, and has overall good components. I had a cheaper LG phone before this one which performed better, and LG is a great company which leads me to believe the faults of this phone are there because it was refurbished. At least I'd certainly like to think so.So anyway it's hard to judge this particular phone, due to its circumstances but a new version of it would probably be awesome!",Bad
This cell suddenly just stop and the screen is frozen and flashing . When you want to see something the screen just star to jump with anothers app that you have and always finish with google voice. If you are speaking star to get really warm. I'm so disappointing because my phone isn't 1 year of used.,Bad
"phone has arabic letters which you can't see when you are buying, and some optoinals that you can find in classics nokia 6700 phones you aren't (?) with this versionNokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition Unlocked Cell Cellular Mobile Phone EDGE and GPRS GSM New",Bad
"There is not enabled Browser, and my GSM operator cann't fix that issue.What can we do??",Bad
sim tray broke and would read my sim card besides that I mean it worked but couldn't use it,Bad
A great phone for the price but doesn't work well with H2o. It cant connect to their internet and cant send or receive picture messages.,Bad
This phone kept freezing and it just plain is slow and really not as great as other people make it seem. Do yourself a favor and save up for a better phone.,Bad
Well let me say that this would be a great phone if it weren't so banged up and expensive for the condition and actual age of the device that's not to say that it doesn't work right because so far it works great and 32gb is wonderful lot of bloatware and junk from att plus the phone is locked to att and u will need a nano SIM card,Bad
"We used the phone with AT&T with out a problem, but unfortunately when we switched to another carrier we learned that the phone was not unlocked as advertised and all attempts to unlock it have futile! (First Straightalk and then Metro PCS)",Bad
"Many bugs with the phone, like vibration on call, text is not working gone through manh troble shoots but no use",Bad
"I've only had this phone for 6 months and it no longer charges or passes data via the USB port. I had to buy a spare battery and external battery charger to continue to use this. I like the phone itself aside from the port issue which has been a known issue with the Galaxy S III. It's still functional for now but not convenient. I've never had a phone break so quickly and I've had a multitude of phones. In fact I still have a galaxy S that my daughter uses and still charges file. Clearly the manufacturing on this model was not up to par and many complaints have been made about this device issue. That being said the transaction went well and this is not a commentary on the seller by any mean, just the quality of the handset as produced by the manufacturer.",Bad
"This phone has great features, including very good battery life, offline maps, pretty decent camera, apps like skype and whatsapp... But the fact that it has no visual notifications for emails is ridiculous.",Bad
"I received a sales floor demo model with an annoying demo program installed which ran itself repeatedly and could not be deleted.Reception was poor.The battery would not hold a full charge.The phone rebooted itself multiple times before starting.It took several hours to recognize the Verizon network.Speaker/volume was too low to hear well, even turned up.One great positive over Motorola and others: Removable battery.This one got returned right away.",Bad
"In January, I purchased 2 phones one for my husband and one for me. One came in a sealed package the other came in an open one with the return bill of a previous buyer and his restaurant bill, too. I should have figured out it was returned because it was damaged. At Wireless Experts Inc.(the seller), they swore the phone was fine, but it is not. Based on my doubts about having it being returned they reimbursed $100 out of the $400 I paid. Anyway, do not buy from them! My phone does not work well. It gets static in one position, does not charge well, the starting screen shows the time and weather in Atlanta when I do not live in the States. Finally, my being an international customer makes it difficult time and money wise to claim for my customer rights.",Bad
"After I received this phone, I give it to my daughter for use and surprise, the phone was locked. I contacted the vendor to resolve the problem but I've never got a positive reply or resolution. We ended by paying more money to unlock the phone.",Bad
never worked this crap and I have sent back to cellular gallery but amazon fix my problem thanks,Bad
About the only thing positive we can say about it is the color of the phone looks nice. Beyond that... Yes the phone was unlocked so we could use the carrier we wanted to use. But the reception is horrible. You couldn't call from inside most public buildings or around places with a lot of metal. The reception would break up so bad you couldn't understand anything on either end of the call and the calls would get disconnected. Sometimes it wouldn't even let you make the call. I would NOT recommend this phone. You can't do much with it and it isn't reliable.,Bad
"I have had this Nokia phone for over a year and am very disappointed with the quality. My previous two cellphones were also Nokia of excellent quality, each phone was used for over 3-5 years. The current Nokia's battery life is less than one tenth of what is advertised even with Blue tooth and Wifi turned off. Wifi keeps turning itself on. Nokia sent me another battery while the phone was still under warranty, which was the wrong size!! In disgust I said nothing. Last month the Bluetooth radio stopped working!!!I am not going to send it back and pay and exorbitant repair bill. I am currently using my older Nokia because of the radio.The touchscreen works sometimes and not in other cases espcially trying to scroll down a list,My next phone will not be a Nokia.",Bad
It's a okay phone. I bought two of these for my brothers and they started to have problems with their headphone jack. My little brother recently having problems with the charging port. I will not buy this one ever again!,Bad
I bought the phone from the seller for my daughter.In about a week the phone crashed.I sent it back to the company to fix it.The company fixed it but the phone crashed again when I tried to update the software.I tried calling the company and the attendant for calls tells me that the technician says that the software is not supposed to be upgraded.I own two other blackberry phone's and I knew what she said was not true.She asks me to call blackberry to solve the issues.I was told that by blackberry the company that sold the phone with the warranty is responsible to fix the device.I was left with no choice but to call my service provider T-mobile to help me with the issue.They did.but I was told the device has no warranty.I am totally disappointed with this company and would never ever recommend anyone from buying anything from them.,Bad
"Some people really like them but I'm not a fan of BlackBerry, this phone especially. The buttons feel cheap and I had to be on the phone for over an hour for at least two days while carrier and I tried to figure out how to get this thing to work. I finally gave it away after having it for only two weeks.",Bad
Still problems with the phone that I have to get fixed but for the most part it was a good upgrade,Bad
"It would lag a lot and get ""stuck"". And is somewhat bulky. I didn't really enjoy using it, so I returned and got another phone. I use it for browsing, texting, emails, and reading; no movies, games or music, so didn't understand the lag. It was too new a phone to already be lagging and sticking, made me wonder how bad it would get down the road. The picture quality isn't bad though.",Bad
So the battery last forever but the earpiece is really really low. The speakerphone is useless and texting sucks.. At least the radio works well.,Bad
"I purchased this phone for a number of reasons unfortunately my desires are not being met.The battery life is so poor that it lasts only about 6 hours after full charging. The picture quality is not at par with other samsung products. I have a samsung note and the resolution is comendable, not so with this duos.",Bad
"Have had this phone for less than 12 hours and I already want to dropkick it into a lake. The finicky touchscreen makes tasks you don't think twice about on another phone IMPOSSIBLE. Attempting to scroll through the screens listing your installed apps is so FRUSTRATING that it may cause you to have a pulmonary embolism.Why 2 stars you ask? The $79 Early Bird price as well as minimal bloatware installed. I'm streaming Spotify on it now with no issues, despite the 4G only speeds that are also disappointing.If my earlier rage subsides, I may keep this phone around. Not likely, but we'll see.",Bad
"Not alot of storage and after a few mounths it wont charge Bought another one once i got it, it didn't charge at all from out the box and tried to return it and still havent heard from them its been over a month now.",Bad
Locked difficulties but the phone is malfuctioning and blinking after 2 weeks of use. flickering. watch what you get. Thanks,Bad
"I am not happy with Asus z6 z2580 phone,because it is Sreen off very frequently.And also Asus and Intelemblums appearing on the screenand standing programmes disappearingfrom screen.And also sound is very low.Totally phone is very poor.please solve and help me",Bad
Phone was great until the software problems. Tried to repair on my computer and still didnt fix the problem.,Bad
"The battery doesn't last a full 8 hours without needing to be charged, but the phone was in good shape.",Bad
It was working perfect but after two days it shut off and won't turn on unless connected to the power. Its fully charged and yet it shuts off after being turned on. Getting a refund!,Bad
I'm having trouble with internet connectivity. Pandora is supposed to be flowing from one song to another but it has a long pause in between songs. I guess I need to carry it to my carrier to configure it....the signal is whack also.,Bad
"Seller experience was excellent.The product itself? Not so much. I replaced a dead Samsung Sidekick with this, and the battery dies within a couple hours, with normal use. I have since replaced this phone with the Galaxy S4, and this one is back in its box.",Bad
Got this phone about 5 months ago it worked great but about a week ago it blacked out where it wouldn't turn on or charge,Bad
"It has the lowest battery and the memory card I bought to extend the capacity turned out to be totally useless, because, no matter what, it saves most of the data on the phone. Bottom line: it's always with no memory left and I can hardly update the apps that came with the phone (most of them that I would like to delete to increase my free space, since I don't use them, but can't because it won't let me, by the way), let alone download new ones.",Bad
"I bought 2 similar items. One was perfect and the other one, the batery failed. It is not working properly.",Bad
"The connection inside the phone is loose and will not charge the phone. The charger was broken when received in the mail and had to purchase a new one, the phone will still not take a charge. I will be returning the phone this week.",Bad
Can't get rid of the ads...can't get to my pictures. Open gallery and it just bumps me off before I can even look at them. Had a little trouble getting Net10 in couldn't get g4 to work but after talking to Net10 staff they got me through it. Battery runs out fast.Nice big screen. Not too big still fits in back pocket Want to return it but the return window just closed!!! So now I can't even get rid of it.,Bad
Loud speaker came broken and I'm outside USA. There is no warranty by Samsung for this brand new device . Not acceptable,Bad
"After 5 months of purchased, the wi-fi, bluetooh and the radio began to fail. Do not upgrade system sofware. Perhaps is a hareware problem.",Bad
"I ordered this Windows phone, like it showed on the page, LG Lancet but then got in the mail an Android phone instead of LG Lancet. Not pleased. At least other things I ordered came and I enjoyed them and they were correct! Not sure to send it back or keep it but this is the first time, I ordered something and it was not what I did order. Most every time, is always good, this time. not what I ordered. Thank you. Enjoyed others I ordered tho. They did rectify it and sent me a different one and I love this one, they even sent me a return envelope to return the wrong one, am pleased with this company and would recommend it to anyone, thank you for doing it so quickly and sending me a newer one and the right one am pleased!",Bad
"I'm in the process of returning this phone to the seller as it was defective from the get go. The seller didn't send me a pre-paid return label so I had to pay shipping but he has told me he will refund that.Also, regarding the phone itself. The hinge will break. We've gone through a few of these and will likely abandon it soon. Beware of this issue as another reviewer stated it is a design flaw.",Bad
"Phone came with no nicks or cracks, good condition. But it was advertised to have a pre-installed SIM card but it did not. I had to go and spend $63.00 for a starter kit because it did not come with it as advertised, it also said the following:Galaxy Note 3 5.7"" Screen. Free Armor-suit screen protector with every phone, and it did not come with it.I spent $170.00 for the phone because of a false advertisement: Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy Note 3 ""White"" run's on Verizon's 4G XLTE Towers via Straight Talk's $45 unlimited 5GB PlanThen I spent $63.00 at Walmart for the activation kit so I could get a SIM card that was not with the phone like it said it would.",Bad
"Everything was working fine the first few days until one day surprisingly the screen went black and later turned rainbow colors. Bought it as a gift and this beautiful looking phone was a necessary tool, did not trust it anymore.",Bad
this phone does not have wireless capability I cant get email cant receive pitcure text i cant get gps to work,Bad
"Refurbished phone ,s pen not original no chance to update android.That phone is from probably return phones from at&t.",Bad
"The mobile web settings are hard-coded into the phone. You can view the communication settings, but there's no way to change them. This phone can only be used for talk and text.UPDATE: Confirmed with Lycamobile today that the phone, indeed, is not COMPLETELY unlocked. Mobile web is locked down. So unless your carrier happens to be AT&T, do not count on getting any data with this phone. This is a common problem with phones unlocked by a third-party. The only real way to guarantee you'll get full functionality is a FACTORY unlocked phone. Otherwise, you're rolling the dice. Lesson learned.",Bad
What's wrong with this phone?!!!! I have used Q5 and Q10 devices before but this one seems to be faulty. Was it refurbished?It just got delivered and for the past 2 hours I have been unable to swipe down to bypass the annoying tutorial and there is no way to skip it. Is the device defective???,Bad
"looked like a new phone and was sold as a new phone, but does not function as a new phone. We bought this phone to replace the exact same phone, so we know how it is suppose to function. Disappointing.",Bad
"I bought this phone because of some of the positive reviews. I wish people were more critical when writing their reviews. I must say I would not want a phone like this even if it is free. I returned the phone the 2nd day I received it. Short battery life, hard to use, low ring tone volume, low phone voice volume. The wifi does not work, the internet is slllllloow. A piece of junk. The SONY WONDER in NY city is so amazing, wish their product is more solidly designed and built.",Bad
"I ordered this phone, which was identical to the one my Mom uses. Her phone was dropped while in rehab and I decided to buy this one to replace it. However, from other reviews, I saw the same complaint regarding the ring volume but decided it might have been a fluke and ordered it anyway. My mom has extremely hard time hearing it ring if TV is on so keeps it on vibrate also which helps somewhat. Would I recommend? NO",Bad
"while it works fine as a smart phone, it will not recognize sim slot number 2. I had a at&t in slot one, and a tmobile in slot two.after making sure the tmobile number was activated and money in the account, I called blu who had me do a hard reset.I had to export all my data prior, and even the reset did not work. they wanted me to send it back for repair, as the amazon30-day warranty was up. well I need a phone. I can see this one in the trash very soon, and no more dual sim phonesin my future. just something else to go wrong.",Bad
"This was a good phone for the first two months, after that i had more problems with this then i did the Blu life pure (which i dropped sadly) if i had the money to buy the life pure again i would. it's super slow and will no longer charge, i have used different chargers that i know work, and my phone won't even respond to the charger. I would go with another choice.",Bad
"Am disappointed for the following reasons:1. Sim1 does not maintain its network, it constantly keep switching between emergency calls only and sim1 network available.2. The time it takes to process a call before it gets through to the receiver is too long.3. What do I do about these",Bad
"Just after warranty (to return) ran out, the phone mic stopped working. Have to send in to Sprint. Not cool.....",Bad
"The phone turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment, it didn't last but about a year ad then the touch screen quit working so I was not happy at all but however this not the sellers fault, the seller did exactly what they promised and the pone was new in the box and arrived earlier than promised so my dissatisfaction is strictly with the phone",Bad
"Not happy with this product at all. Did not receive what was showed and offered. It is not a new phone as requested. Half the keyboard faulty, battery not new, i was sent a refurbished phone not the new phone i ordered. In fact it still contained old videos from who ever had it from 2009 and 2011.",Bad
"I was coming from an old 3g i phone. The internet is to slow on that to pay at&t $25 a month for 3g service, so i figure I would get this one and save some money till the new one comes out. This is a silly phone, everything written in the other reviews is true, I should have listened. Silly buttons and screen, sideways for letters and up down for numbers. Very counterintuitive. Price isn't everything.",Bad
Wasn't happy with this case at all..it felt like cardboard and started tearing on second day. Wish idroid made sturdy cases..this is the only one I've found.,Bad
"I recently bought this phone and at first i thought it was great. However, mmy bbm's often take really long to deliver and sometimes it shows good battery but shuts completly down wen i make or recieve a call. When i pluug it in to charge it takes a while to start functioning again because the battery is sooo dead..confusing to me but hey..wudnt reccomend these pple at all..cause they dont accept returns!",Bad
"You have no idea how I loved this phone and this was second one. The batter had exceptional life, easy to use, great pictures. You name it, it had it. Both phones out no where just cut of. One cut off before the thirty day period and the other afterwards. Twice is enough. If this is the same company who make the electronic cigarettes, maybe they should stick to making those. However, if they can significantly improve this phone, I would buy again.",Bad
"I was disappointed with the size of the damage on the top of the screen. A large part of the screen is missing. It had said there was a crack, but it's more like a chunck of the screen fell out.",Bad
"Talk time about 1 hour, standby time maybe 5 or 6 hours-- but that was not the problem. This beautiful wonderful gorgeous phone would not bluetooth connect to other bluetooth electronic devices I use, making it basically useless for my on the road work. Returned it.",Bad
"I bought it for my mother who liked Nokia and known a little English. But to my surprise, this has neigher Chinese system language nor Chinese menu as Iphone has. I hadn't got this information until I opened and set up it. If I return it, I will lost 20%-50%. So I have to remain it.",Bad
"This phone does fine with sending and receiving text messages, however it does not do well getting service for calls. The first phone I had like this worked perfectly, so I'm not sure why this is different.",Bad
This case is great for protection but if you talk on the phone a lot I don't recommend it. The person you're speaking to can't hear you very good :(,Bad
"this phone is not unlucked. THis phone has a company service. I was not able to use it in my country so is useless. I have to pay $50 dollars to open bands or unlocked, So the information is false. THe phone IS NOT UNLOCKED",Bad
This phone never works with 2 apps open. And it's very slow but has a nice feel.,Bad
The phone did not have a good camera and did not work well with any company,Bad
The phone drops calls on me a lot and I can't get any help for it.,Bad
"I expected a used phone in great condition. I got a phone with dings filed with white stuff (repair glue?) Also huge scratches on camera hole, and screen. The screen gets stuck-a lot. The camera sucks.",Bad
Phone didn't hold up well. had to be replaced about 6 months after getting it. Cheap quality. Would not purchase again.,Bad
I did not think it played loud enough or clear enough for a work phone and I returned it. Also The screen is very small,Bad
When I received my note 3 it wouldn't charge now I have to charge all night long doesn't get a good signal thought it was inspected by a tech after being referbished wouldn't recommend it to anyone after the trouble I have had,Bad
"I liked he size and price of this cell phone and the features were nice. I returned the phone because so many people complained that there was distortion on the line. I couldn't hear it but the people I called said they heard echoes, chirping noises and other aggravating sounds during calls. Also when I used the speaker phone, voices sounded muffled.",Bad
This product was very difficult to set up. Even now most of the time it refuses to connect and give an error message telling us that our devices is not recognized. The one time I made a phone call it dropped the call so that I had to use more minutes to reconnect. I am new to satellite communications so maybe I was expecting too much but the set up issues are inexcusable.,Bad
"In pic it shown ear piece and adaptor and box, but i received only unit with cable. W. W. W",Bad
"I changed by Blackberry for this iphone 4S, but the battery is maximum 8 hours life, compared to my ex bb, more than 24 hours. The bb is more friendly than this iphone.",Bad
"I can't honestly say I hated it. I could make calls on it. The phone would shut off on its own more than 90% of the time. I couldn't receive most of my calls because it was always shutting off. If I let the flip part stay open I would have better luck with it staying on, but not always. This started the second week I had it.I eventually went on to ebay and found a better phone.",Bad
My phone did not come with a sim tray...now i have to order it -____-,Bad
"While the phone was unlocked as advertised, it ONLY WORKS WITH T-MOBILE 3G SERVICE. If you are using AT&T, you will be STUCK WITH EDGE. The company would NOT even respond to my inquiry about returning the product. All communication was going fine back and forth with the company until I asked about their return policy, at which time they would not even return my email.ONLY BUY IF USING WITH T-MOBILE.",Bad
"Camera is not good as it says it is, my main reason of purchasing it was the ""beautiful 23mpx camera"". Galaxy s7 does a lot better job with 12mpx than this xz, very disappointed, the sd card slot didn't read the sd card after a day, the camera started glitching. As I said very very disappointed with this phone. Hope Sony will do better next time.And also the phone came in very weird box, looked like it was used item. Not like iPhone sealed box. Didn't liked it.",Bad
Hideous. Bulky. Difficult to install. Would be great if I climbed trees for a living with a phone clipped to me. Awful for regular use. Returned it!,Bad
"The picture is beautiful, and it has awesome useful features. I love the size and it works well with my AT&T go service. The problems were, the speaker and the motherboard. I can hear people well on my end but they have a hard time hearing me. The keys on the left side of the keyboard works periodically, and the phone freezes often. Wouldn't recommended this phone.",Bad
"The phone that actually came is the 9507V which was only released in HK and Australia. This is false advertising!! checked download mode to confirm what model it was and to make sure it wasn't fake since non-samsungs don't have that mode, and discovered the false model number and that it was running custom, modified software that makes it look like the 9505.",Bad
I actually liked this phone at first. Everything was working really fine than all of a sudden this morning the phone said it couldnt read my sim card. Wtf ? If this could be fix than I will be really happy but if not I want my money back asap,Bad
"Have to give 2 stars. This was a nice phone at first, but after about 3 months, I was using the phone and it just made a loud POP! I noticed shortly after that there was a single clean break down the center face of the screen. I chatted with Motorola and they said they had repairs starting at $100, no warranty coverage.",Bad
I received this phone but it does not hold any charge at all. I was hoping to return it and receive my money back since we need to get a new phone.,Bad
phone is small and very handy.The phone doesnot have much reception in US. Works fine outside but not in any closed areas. Sound clarify is ok and camera is good.,Bad
After about 3 weeks of use the charging port got pushed up into the phone rendering the phone useless. We tried multiple exterior battery charging systems and none worked. So now we have an expensive piece of junk.,Bad
"The is a bit disappointing. Although I have a 32gb memory card, I am unable to download apps or even upgrade the apps I already have. Even if I send it to the memory card it says not enough space and when you check the space it tells you that 30gb is available. Also, the battery has to be charged everyday so I have to ensure that my power bank is with me all the times. Very disappointed!",Bad
i got this phone because of the built in battery which is supposed to last long well it doesnt and it goes dead too quickly and gets hot for no reason even if its not in use....,Bad
The phone I received was not described as in the post. The screen was clearly replaced but not replaced properly making the multi-touch defective in some spots. Also the speaker does not work. Not something I would buy again.,Bad

"This phone is a S5570i Galaxy Pop Plus, Chinese version, not an S5570 as advertised. Although English language is installed (good luck to find it!), many functions are only in Chinese. Software updates are not allowed in the US for this product.If you can live with this, go ahead, as the Galaxy Pop Plus is a good phone. Otherwise, please buy a US version.",Bad
"Purchased this phone for my Dad for Christmas. He's a Blackberry fanatic! Sadly, after 3 days of charging the phone the battery still was unable to go past the 30% mark without any use at all. No SIM inserted. No phone calls. No wifi used at all. And still the battery won't take a charge. Returning it with a heavy heart.",Bad
"I specifically asked the supplier before buying that the Doro cellphone was ""unlocked"" and able to be used in New Zealand on another network but Vodafone NZ tell me that although they have transferred my existing SIM card to the Doro cellphone , I have to get Consumer Cellular in the US to tell me if I can activate the phone. I have e mailed them to ask their advice but I did not expect to have to do this and it is very disappointing.The mailing charges were high and if I have to return product, would expect a full refund.",Bad
"While the phone is not terrible, the battery only charges to 75% and loses the charge after 10 minutes. Very disappointed.",Bad
"the menu button didn't work after three months later, but the seller refused to fix it even they said it's US warranty in the title. i tried to contact the Samsung custom service to fix it, but they said my cellphone is not sold in US and it do not have the warranty. therefore, i don't recommend to buy this cell phone, there are at least one year warranty for any electronics if you buy it locally.",Bad
my phone works fine but worry by recent news about *LG4 phones dies after 6-12 month*friend just sent one to LG for repair/replace. I'll update how committed they are to satisfy customers.,Bad
"It is not like the picture, there is an AT&T sign on the top of the phone where soppused to be an HCT sign, this makes me feel it was an locked phone but they unlocked it and sell it.",Bad
It works but very cheap made and I wish I can buy better quality phone,Bad
"Phone was in excellent condition. There was no note that it was the Verizon version, though; bootloader locked. Gave it away immediately.",Bad
I had 2 of these phones orginally from Verizon. We even wrote and asked did it work on the VZ network. It only worked in our area. Wouldn't call or text when traveling outside the area. However the seller was very nice in returning and refunding money.,Bad
"Supposedly the battery charges faster, but that's not true, it takes hours. We have T-Mobile and it will not get 4G, only 3G at best, but even that is not steady. It drops it and goes to ""E"", or ""H"", which I have no clue what that's supposed to be.",Bad
This product has way to many issues. Please be prepared for that and know what you are getting into before you buy this phone. Good build quality and excellent screen as well as camera but battery life takes a hit due to ongoing software issues with Windows 10.,Bad
"This watch is ok, but I was disappointed when I tried to add a SIM card and this function didn't work because the idm # was no good. So Joy Geek is selling defective watches. Read all the reviews and no one really tried the Sim Card feature. It works great with my Bluetooth LG G Stylo Smart Phone. But now I'm disappointed and reall can't return the purchase.",Bad
The phone is great but at first it worked well like for 6hrs and after that I noticed whenever I am texting someone it keep saying CAN'T SEND MESSAGE. I tried everything to fix it but it does not want to send my text messages to my friends. The battery life does not run long. Another problem the audio. When I put it on speaker mode the voice of the other person on the other line sounds choppy or static although the reception is 100%. So I decided to send it back less than 24hrs via UPS!,Bad
"Since I bought the cell, the light of the screen shakes, checking online, shows that it is a failure of the cell, which will give me solution?",Bad
"Bought as a replacement for one my daughter broke. The phone had problems, over sensitve, occasional random acts, it was an older version as well. Whether that was from a lack of info in the description or my misreading on my part I cannot say. Eventually lucked into a good deal on another phone and this one was shelved after two months.",Bad
"I purchased this product because I was nowhere near an upgrade with Tmobile and had my previous phone (blackberry) stolen. This was my first touch screen smart phone. It was okay for awhile and i even bought a bigger mini sd card. Once I started downloading apps and taking photos, the phone slowed to less than a snails pace. If you don't restart it at LEAST once a day, the phone will go extremely slow, apps will freeze, and things simply will not work. It is EXTREMELY frustrating, and that is probably the only reason i'm writing this review. I would not buy this phone again, and the first chance i get, I will be smashing it to pieces. I know it is a low end phone, but when you have less than 10 downloaded apps and you can't access your photo gallery because there isn't enough space on your phone, it get very frustrating. I wish i had made a different decision, because i now must wait 4 more months with this piece of crap until my contract is up. Upside.. very compact phone.",Bad
I like the phone but it wont let me use snapchat or viber or alot of the other apps I use alot plus the when I make calls the speaker sucks,Bad
"I did not care how heavy it was, until the phone started to malfunction . One day away from warranty that it was what save me!",Bad
"Bought it back in July and today nov. 2nd battery is dead. I have a lot of problems with reception and connection, I do no use it enough for the battery to have died already. I can't use it half the time.",Bad
I had owned four bb torches before this. And this is the worst in many ways. The structure us weak. Each time you press on the keys you feel likee the entire phone 8s about to break. I was so unhappy that I switched to a new phone. The torch is still sitting unused on my desk,Bad
"Issue: When I send a text it will immediately pop up try again message can't be deliveredTried with below things:When I use this SIM on another phone I'm able to send messages just fine. So no problem with the SIM, network or network provider.I've already to rest to factory setting couple of timeI've already tried the power cycle. Infact I also did a hard reboot, i.e.. removed the battery while the phone was switched on and inserted the battery after a couple of minutes and powered the phone on. It did not help.",Bad
2 months after purchasing suddenly the battery life is terrible! Nothing I have done has helped and it goes from 50% to dead in seconds some times. All other functions are fine but I've had to start carrying a booster battery to restart my phone.,Bad
"The standing joke about the Apple iPhone 5c is that the ""c"" stands for ""cheap,"" not ""color."" The phone came with a sim card that you'll have to take to the Verizon store to activate. It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee. When it worked, the phone was nice and fun because of the color, but working with this vendor isn't worth it.",Bad

"I reviewed this product when we bought it and it was good at first. but after using it for about 2 months, the phone started getting really slow and starting lagging alot. battery life started deminishing as well. I bought this phone for my husband for his bday. My husband is not on his phone all day like I am, he uses it to make phone calls and texts, barely uses any of his apps, so lagging and slowing down was unjustifiable. I would not recommend this product.",Bad
A bit slow and the screen doesn't actually work if there is water on the phone. For me I would never have bought this phone if i would have known that very misleading reviews. If I wasn't out of the country for work I would have returned this Phone. Embarrassing buy.,Bad
"The phone has many glitches, including but not limited to:Shutter on camera that will not openCamera does not take and capture photosWiFi does not recognized any familiar networksBattery extremely weak, charge runs out within 3 hours with occasional usageOther than that the phone is great for email,web browsing, Facebook, etc.",Bad
"It's 6 weeks after I got the phone and the battery is dying in front of my eyes, this is an OEM battery about 6 weeks old. I'm not a heavy user at all the opposite! I tried to contact the amazon and was told that its too late to replace it and I would have to contact the manufacturer which expressed sorrow and thats it.",Bad

"I received the phone that I bought as unlocked. However, the phone came locked and its asking for ""Network Lock control key"" with option for unlock or dismiss after entering the number.

"This is great if you need a CHEAP travel phone. Battery lasts 2 days. However, it has some MAJOR shortcomings1. Everytime you push a button, it makes a musical chime in a different note. EVERY.TIME. Its annoying as heck. Eventually you get used to it, and start to enjoy the abuse in a masochistic kind of way (or at least I do), but it is definitely not low profile. Text on the bus? Fugghedabout it!2. Texting: Anyone here born before 1990 may remember this, or may have blocked it out of their mind. T9 texting without prediction? Inconvenient is a mild word for it. Texting is functionally useless for anyone accustomed to the modern era.3. FYI you can't change the wallpaper, if you care.I would not care at all if it got lost, so its a great travel phone for its low cost. Much cheaper than buying an unlocked phone. But would you rather pay an extra 100 bucks or less, get your phone unlocked/buy the unlocked version and not have to deal with all this hassle? I guess it depends if you travel to nice places or not.",Bad

"Dropped my phone less than a month after I got it and the screen cracked all the way across. I set up my phone with AT&T and E is the fastest speed I can get, no matter where I am. It is set up for 4G as instructed. I had high hopes for this rugged looking and feeling phone, but as of now, I'm quite disappointed. I'll update my review if that changes.",Bad
I bought two of these phones in February and one of them started randomly texting characters. The only way to get it to stop was to restart the phone. I sent it back to LG who claims they have a 1 yr warranty and they confirmed it was not working correctly but they also informed me it was not under warranty because I bought it as an unlocked device. It seems LG does not honor a warranty if the phone is purchased unlocked. This would have been good to know while considering this phone.,Bad
Love the sliding key board great for texting but if I try to send a picture I can not send it to any one. And I can not get on the internet.,Bad
Bought for son for Christmas. Keeps turning off by itself and when texting. Very frustrating,Bad
"It works as a phone but will not display pictures in mms, and is very difficult to use google play store. Also having issues locating this 8 gig, no memory shows without using a card.",Bad
"At first i really liked the phone and although frustrating to learn a new IOS, (I was an iPhone user), it seemed to be a nice phone on day 1. Then i realized it drains the battery ultra fast, then I couldn't get the settings to where the screen wouldn't go haywire every time I was texting. Then the worst - the charger port pin bent and it won't take a charge. I've had to purchase a spare battery charger for now and contacting the seller has proven to be WORTHLESS! I filed a claim to return it and also sent the seller and email to make sure they saw the request and they basically said ""since you filed a claim I won't help you!"". Now all I want is to know where to order the charger port and instructions of how to do it (since it's a clone, some cell phone repair places will not work on it). The seller has yet to help me and I have no idea how to contact the manufacturer directly!I guess i'll be paying more $$ for a replacement since the seller won't stand behind the product.",Bad
Overall for what it is and price isn't bad but it should clearly be stated this phone doesn't include a GPS. It may have one but it is the most useless GPS ever to be included in a phone it just doesn't work so navigation with the phone is impossible.,Bad
"The home button doesn't work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. A little disappointed",Bad
"I tried to venture into the world of Windows Phones and it failed quite a bit. I purchased the Nokia Lumia 928 in new condition and, within a couple of weeks of use, it started freezing. Eventually, it froze on a pixelated grey screen that wouldn't go away for hours - the first time it happened, I thought the phone was broken; the second time, I just left it to ""fix itself"" overnight because I knew I would have no luck trying to turn it off. That's when I realized I needed to return the phone.As for the operating system itself, it goes without saying that heavy app users should probably not choose Windows.",Bad
I thought I was getting a better phone with more options and it did not. it has less... I wish I just spent the money and got another phone G 4 that I broke.,Bad
I bought this phone for a gif to my niece abroad to US. I didn't have time to try because I had to send it the same day that I received. My niece was so excited but then when she received the battery and the charge didn't work. So my Family had to buy a new one.,Bad

"I'm pretty disappointed...the seller said that this would run on AT&Ts LTE network, it does not. It only gets 2G, which is utter crap. Other than that, the phone itself is pretty good...I just hate being told that it will run so great then it runs in such outdated form...pretty disappointed because it's useless to me without Wi-Fi. Should have paid more for a newer model xD learned my lesson here.",Bad
after phone was set up it freezes every once in a while. with a new phone you would expect to avoid these issues.,Bad

"I'm really not happy with the quality of these phones. I have ordered two used and factory refurbished. One had an amazingly horrible battery. I charged it to 100%"" set it up, and it was almost dead. And would die as soon as it hit five percent. So I ordered this one. It arrived with its test pictures still on it, the background was not reset to factory settings, and to make matters worse it won't connect to the Internet! My phone got stolen out of my car, iPhones are crazy expensive, and I thought factory refurbished from Amazon would be the cheaper way to go. Definitely NOT! Think twice before ordering these phones!!!",Bad
"Was said to be in very good condition,phone was dented on back color in areas rubbed off screen scratched the numbers have wear areas.The phone even when charged will not stay on. Not happy with this phone. The picture looks nice but when in hand not so nice.",Bad
Have used this for barely 4 months and it has problems. Whenever I'm making or receiving a call I have to conect the ear plug because the mic on the phone doesn't work. people complain that they hear scribbly sounds like breeze passing through the mic and they don't hear my voice. this is not good.,Bad

"The new phone performed no better than my old one. I liked the phone in general; however, battery life was no where near what the description indicated.",Bad

(original is black),Bad
"I had this exact phone when it was first released about 2 years ago... and I loved it... for about 6 months. Then it got very slow... going to the home screen or opening up texts would take several minutes. I got rid of it. I recently bought this phone hoping my old one was defective, but this one started lagging about 1 week in! To load ""Maps"" for directions takes about 5 minutes! It is very time consuming for very, very simple tasks. I do not play games on the phone. Overall, this would be a great phone BUT it's so slow it makes it worthless. I'm switching to the Amazon Fire phone ASAP!",Bad
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,Bad
"I was really pleased when I unboxed this phone and set it up via wifi. At that point I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately that changed when I attempted to install the sim and micro sd card. When I inserted the tray into the phone it wasn't recognized and stuck out from the side of the phone just a tiny bit at a slight angle. When I went to remove it and try to reinsert, the tray broke when pulling it back out. I thought maybe I could just get another tray but when I turned the phone over some of the contacts fell out. I have no idea whether this is a design defect or I just got a defective phone but so much for the pre release discount.",Bad
"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it.

No offense to the company itself whom sent it, they were very happy to help.",Bad
"Not bad. But when it wiggles it turns the sound off or disconnects. When a call comes in, and you hit the button- it doesn't always open/answer the call. The other issue, is when you are talking, sometimes the sound goes off, and one party can hear and the other can't (both ways). So it's not the mute button.",Bad
"Before I start let me state clearly that I've been a user of WindowsPhone since WP7 and I've always been quite pleased with the OS. Prior to my purchase of the Lumia 930, I've used a Lumia 920 with which I had no issues and an HTC HD 7. My Lumia 930, however, has one annoying major issue, the mic for the speaker phone isn't working! It doesn't work with the phone app, Viber or Whatsapp. A quick search revealed that is issue is not uncommon for the Lumia 930 and unfortunately, the only option would be to return it. It is quite a disappointment given that the Lumia is the only real option for Windows phones.",Bad
"I can't believe that this phone was new. It has been nothing but problems! I feel it is defective as I have had this phone for years and has numerous problems with it. I would like to return it and get my money back. I kept overlooking all the problems that came up with it but can no longer do that. I will be going back to my old phone and will not be using it any longer. I bought a card for it and still can't load music on it.

"First of all, amazing phone for $150, that being said the GPS never worked and takes forever to search for location. The most ANNOYING thing is that now my screen blinks on and off during phone calls which is fine if some one on the other end hangs up otherwise you would have to take the battery out. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY you can listen to your voice mails or make any automated phone calls.My return window expired two weeks ago and now i am stuck with a phone that i cannot use to make phone calls.UPDATEThis phone is basically an S4, therefore one can get help from S4 forums. Found out the proximity sensor and the GPS is a huge problem with the S4's.For a solution i downloaded an app called ""keep light on"" which took care of the blinking problem. Next i downloaded ""mapquest"" which works much better than google maps.Now my phone is running like nothing ever happened",Bad

"This phone is beautiful, although a bit large. My problems with this phone are:(1) It keeps shutting down while I'm using GPS -- it will just restart while I'm on the freeway trying to get to my destination, and yesterday it even froze while trying to restart. It's nearly impossible to pull over in rush hour traffic in Los Angeles, so this is unpleasant.(2) It pauses audiobooks/podcasts for a few seconds before restarting. It says it's still playing, so you just have to wait out the five seconds for it to continue. That would be fine, but sometimes it happens every five minutes.(3) It lags.I've had it for four months. Problem 1 is somewhat new, and a dealbreaker, and problem 2 , though bearable, started right when I got the phone.I'll see if BLU will do something about it.",Bad

I just buy this phone last week and I can't use it with AT&T SIM card to use it . I don't know why????,Bad
"Not a quality device like I thought it'd be. Its beautiful on the outside but the system sucks. I can't use apps like tumblr, crossyroad or game of dice without it crashing. And Ive already tried keeping my phone free of space.Other minor things include brightness problems, camera functionality and app incompatibility.This phone wasn't designed for the camera it's using. They might as well have left the front camera off for how unnapealing it looks. All pictures are distorted and don't even think about using snapchat.And the screen isn't even that big. You lose so much screen potential off of the black frame it's a ripoff. The sample picture clearly shows just a thin line of of black around the screen. However the ACTUAL product has an almost double the size of the shown line.While I understand this phone is cheap, I would much rather pay a couple more hundred dollars for this phone, but much better quality.",Bad

Price was good, arrived next day as promised by DigitalandMore and it is brand new in factory package. Activated the phone easily. First call I receive, I can barely hear the caller, second call same thing... I turn up every volume button I can find and finally resort to Google. Well, guess what?

"It had water damage, but I kept it because it worked. It is a smart phone though,so you're cell phone company will charge you",Bad
Phone is in great shape...sadly the battery is NOT. I had to order a new battery the one that came with the phone runs down VERY quickly.,Bad
"After reading tech reviews, I wasn't expecting much in the way of features. As most of the reviews explain, this is more of ""side-grade"" as oppose to an upgrade. I was fine with that. When I received the phone, it was apparently for the European market as the charging plug was not US. Not a big deal. I have plenty chargers. My gripe with the phone is with the charging time and battery life. The life didn't seem to be performing better than my aged M7, which considering this was suppose to be a new phone, I would have expected better. But even that wasn't too bad as i was at least getting a full day's use out of the phone. The worst experience i had was with the charging time. After 10 hours of charging the phone had only reached 77%. Not acceptable.",Bad
"it was advertised to have bigger print on the screen. the only thing that is bigger is the numbers, which dose no good if the name cant be seen. it dosent hold a charge for as long as it is advertised for either.",Bad
It's OK but the battery doesn't keep it's energy for too long even when not in use and can't find a phone case for the brand and for the price I paid I expected a little more and pictures aren't that great either so sorry just being honest,Bad
"Very neat watch. I especially lIke the alarm since it both vibrates and makes noise and I tend to be a heavy sleeper and it wakes me up. But I will say it's really hard to use text messaging on it with the screen being so small. I've also had trouble with it linking up to applications and linking properly with my phone, samsung galaxy. It's bulky as well so it's not a comfortable watch to wear all the time. Also the band is not breathable at all so having a sweaty wrist while wearing it isn't exactly cute either. With all that being said, it still is a neat and useful watch especially in loud environments where you can't hear your phone going off.",Bad
Doesn't take a charge very well and the cover already broken off from it. Paid 93.00 dollars to a phone that only lasted two months.,Bad
"The team is not released, I will be able practically no use. In this condition the phone does not work, I think that if they have international alcalcen should do in that particular emphasis",Bad
"I got this phone in order to pick up wifi as many people do. It does pick up wifi because it is unlocked but the browser is horrible. Usually after about 3 minutes of browsing it would stop and give a memory error. When I called a customer service center the keypad wouldn't let me enter the menu options. The camera on this is horrible too, and many of the 'widgets' you can't download with just wifi. For just over 200 dollars you can get the LG Optimus T unlocked which supports the latest Androhid 2.2 Froyo with a great browser. Another stupid thing about this phone is that the head phone jack is propitiatory and is not the normal 3.5mm jack. Stay away from this stupid phone, get something android based.",Bad
"Not at all happy with this product, not geared for adult wrist, too clumsey to really use..cannot navigate around the design to eve really use it. would not recommend..save your money to buy the real thing.",Bad

After two weeks the speaker broke. So we could receive calls but couldn't hear what the other person was saying.,Bad
"I bought this phone less than 2 months and it already giving me trouble. I can't download my marketplace programs since I receive it so basically all I can do is call, text and use the WiFi. In addition the when I call anyone they can't hear me on there end and this has happen to me several times since I go it and the touchscreen is giving trouble. I am sorry I bought this phone I feel I wasted my money.",Bad

Fast shipping the item scratch a lot honme button not working wel a camera is not clear need change len,Bad
I am writing this review after getting a replacement and 2 months of use -PROS -1. Beautiful design and slim phone2. Light weightCON -1. Software is unpredictable - First time I send this phone back I had problems with call where other person would not be able to hear me when the call was on speaker phone. Same when using headset.2. Second phone I got did not have previous problems but now the screen freezes and u do not even realize until u try to unlock the phone. Suppose you have the phone in pocket the screen would freeze and no one would be able to contact you as it is similar to your phone being off. Lot of reboots too3. Apart from the design there is not much in this phone and I would really hope BLU improves their software reliability.,Bad
"I am very disappointed in the phone I received. I received a charger that doesn't work, and all my phone does is reboots and freeze by itself. I tried to contact the seller, he will not answer back.",Bad
"The phone was in PERFECT condition UNTIL I turned it on!!! It had ZERO scratches or dents and powered up just fine. But no matter where I was it took FOOOOOREVVERRRRRR to load anything, even with full 4G LTE signal. So, I ended up dropping it on the sidewalk and being happier because I switched back to my old phone with less battery strength but quicker loading speed. But I took a chance and got what I asked for so whatever.",Bad
I order two of these phones. one works fine. the other is worthless. the speaker doesn't work. it keeps shutting off.,Bad
"Secret Backdoor in Some U.S. Phones Sent Data to China, Analysts Say[...]This is ludicrous. We've been misled by this company saying it was an error with their opera installation.""Kryptowire, the security firm that discovered the vulnerability, said the Adups software transmitted the full contents of text messages, contact lists, call logs, location information and other data to a Chinese server. The code comes preinstalled on phones and the surveillance is not disclosed to users, said Tom Karygiannis, a vice president of Kryptowire, which is based in Fairfax, Va. ‰ÛÏEven if you wanted to, you wouldn‰Ûªt have known about it,‰Û he said.""Feels fast, however no ability to switch DPI. Android VR apps show up as very small blocks and cant be resized. Waiting for Cyanogen/other firmware. Needs rooted asap.

"the phone is being giving problems all along , while speaking it cuts off ater 30 to 45 seconds during the conversation, many at times it freezes",Bad
"When I first got the phone, I liked it. Then the first BLU system update happened. Ok, so I had to reset a few things - no biggie. And the the second update... GARBAGE! The 2nd update messed up the haptic feedback somehow and essentially rendered my GPS useless. Camera and picture quality were fine. Volume with headphones a little wonky at times, especially if listening to music and playing a game (game almost always painfully louder for some reason). If you refuse the Android updates from BLU, the phone is great, but if you take the updates...You are on your own!",Bad
On off button stopped working properly after 6 months and could not get a refund from the seller.,Bad
"I had a very old version of Nokia basic cell phone and I was very happy very it. When I started shopping a new one, Nokia was my first option without hesitation. I still only wanted to get a basic one since touch screen had never been my friend. That is why I picked this one because I thought after-sale service would not be a problem since the seller was Amazon. The sound quality problem which this phone had was out of my imagination. When I first started, I could hear it sounded like I was in a very big empty space. People couldn't hear me clearly. Phone is used to make conversations. Sound quality is the most important feature. I had to return it.",Bad
"No where does it say that this, is a global phone that has two sim cards. Couldn't work with several phone companies",Bad
Phone is OK but issues such as:1 - Quality of Mic is pretty bad2 - Music (Streaming or on devices) gets choppy when phone locks (battery goes to sleep),Bad
"It started off ok, but now it locks up. Maybe a drop of water got in the USB port (right side), but the button is now locked out within minutes of starting. Pretty much a writeoff.",Bad
"Worked great for the first 3 months than lose it's performance. Probably received a defective unit just like the bunch Sony produced. Many of their phones are faulty considering many users are facing similar problem as me, the phone keep restrating constantly I can barely use it . Tried every tips still won't solved the problem. Front camera takes bad pictures in low light, pictures get blurry blurry and retouched automatically when taken. I will no longer need buy sony smartphones for that I can't take the risk.",Bad
"We purchased this phone in September--delivered on September 19. Was working great until this past Saturday when we decided to ""update"" the phone as per the ""update"" messages on the phone. As soon as the updates were complete and the computer screen gave the OK to use the phone again, we turned it on and then the phone went crazy!!!! It kept turning itself on and off. We called Samsung directly and they had us hard boot the phone. After several attempts, the hard boot completed, but the problem was still the same. I know the description says no warranty, but if this is a ""new phone"" as advertised, I would think we should be able to get our money back (or replacement). Planning to call to selling company to see if that would be an option--if this truly was a ""new phone"", it should not have died after only six weeks of use. Very sad.",Bad
"When I received my refurbished phone, it looked new but it works poorly. I'm sending it back for another one in hopes that it will work.",Bad
"I bought it to replace a defective iPhone 4s. I did not want to be under a carrier contract and the price and features seemed right. I spent some time doing my research and ordered the phone along with a SIM Card Tray Adapter (iCoolkit) and a 32 GB MicroSDHC. I received the phone, installed the SIM and SDHC card and had it up and running in 15 min. I was happy for 15 days but then the phone started to lock and reboot without any apparent reason. I called the BLU support line twice, and after waiting about one hour on hold (twice) I decided to try another manufacturer.",Bad
"Cute phone, but...does not have the range the original Razr had, very poor reception, drops calls constantly, battery does not hold a charge very long. Will not buy another!",Bad
"I would not recommend this phone for people who need simple functionality or good Bluetooth capabilities. I came from having a moto g, and I think you really do get what you pay for. After 3 months with this phone, I am counting it as a loss and going back to Motorola. It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't. The text message app is horrible, I downloaded a new one to make it usuable. This phone would be a good starter phone for a teenager, but that's about it. The speakers are bad enough that I have to use speaker phone to make calls (I'm 25)",Bad
Ok so far but what the hell kinda charger is this??? Adding to my previous comment this phone does not have an IR blaster!! But the older models do. I'm bummed!! Samsung really messed up this time but the camera is nice. I'm very disappointed about the absense of the Infrared technology though.,Bad
did not come with Verizon sim card like it stated in add (this cell phones are fully compatible with veirzon) I can not use it until I go to a Verizon storeand hope they will give me a sim card,Bad
"This phone is the WORST!! THE PHONE blacks out whenever , it moves slow, the camera is terrible . Never again -! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE",Bad

"The phone appears to be working just fine for now... Broke the screen when it was dropped.Took the phone to the Apple store only to be informed that this is is not an Apple phone. They told us that the blue casing is not apple, and that the screen all the way to the inner workings were not apple and that they would not touch it for repair etc. It appears this is a knock off. It is working so far but for how long. This seller advertised this as a new Apple phone- Buyer beware.",Bad
blu is the worse types of phone... would not spend another dollar on anyone of them... I went through 3 blu in one year. Do not worth it,Bad
The phone is good but I keep having problems with it holding charge. Sometimes I have 40% and then my phone shuts off dead. Seriously annoying.,Bad

"I could not get this phone to work with Sprint. It is my understanding that Sprint is CDMA 2000. I tried for 2 months, with Sprints help. No luck. I really wanted to like this phone but couldnt get it to work. I have read on multiple sites it works with Sprint......not for me :(",Bad
"while the phone itself is good in term of its HW, after moving to this from iPhone I have to say that since the OS that comes with this device Android 4.4 which not allowing you to change the setting for applications permissions - which in effect lets any application you install to do whatever the application writer let it do, it means that you lose any control over the installed applications and you basically let any installed application to access to private data you have and sends any data to google or to the company that wrote the application and even allowing them to install other application ""for"" you and you cannot do nothing about it!Also I have to say that iPhone is easier to use and it size is better (the 5"" screen is simply too big).the good points are -it is very fastthe screen is very detailed (but not in the same league as iPhone 5)i would not buy Android phone again",Bad
"Phone did not come with earphones which were removed from original packaging and phone that I received has a faulty camera, both front and back",Bad

When your making a call and you put your face up to the screen it goes black then when your done making the call or you need to use the dial-pad it doesn't always show up so you cant access that menu, or hang up the call.. Got it refurbished and EVERY other Refurbished phone I have gotten is like new! this is a let down.",Bad
"They say factory unlocked and the seal was broken. Mobile looked like used, so returned.",Bad
Phone uses twice as much battery in days time as other identical phones would like my money back!,Bad
"Not related to the phone itself. The Samsung note 5 seems fine, but it might be because I bought this off of amazon and it's refurbished but I am returning the phone I bought from edge cellular because it keeps dropping and muting calls randomly. I've ordered a new one from same company and hope it was just a fluke.",Bad
"The first phone I received was obviously a used or refurbished phone. The manual was dogeared and the phone had signs of wear & tear. The phone's speaker volume was poor. So I sent it back. The second phone was functional, but the manual was for another phone. The packaging was very worn and the cord had obviously been used. I kept the phone since it worked, but this product is well below the typical amazon quality that I expect.",Bad
"I think these items being advertise as ""new"" are not really new but refurbished. I purchased two of these phones; one worked for three weeks and the other would not rec ognize any sim card at all. I had to send back one and now the other one is not working either after 3weeks so I'll have to send it back also.I'm not in the states so its costly to send back these phones that the worse part of it. I'm extremely disappointed because I love these phone and wish they would just work well and I didn't have to return them. I really hope to get back one that's working soon.",Bad
"The first thing I learned was that this is the first droid and there was no app for backup assistance. The second complaint, it took at least 5-10 seconds for the phone to do anything. It didn't search the peoples list well. I tried google download for people, but just got ""Notes""... not the real numbers. What a pain!",Bad
"If you don't need to use bluetooth, the phone is pretty good. If you need bluetooth, avoid it. The Kit Kat update did NOT fix the bluetooth issue. It will connect to a device, but it cuts in and out and eventually disconnects. When I emailed Blu customer support, they implied that the issue was my bluetooth device. It will not connect reliably to any of my bluetooth devices (even though every other family members' phones work with those devices and they have various brands/models). Since Blu does not appear to be committed to fixing the issue or even acknowledging that it exists, I will be returning my phone. I live in a city that requires use of hands-free devices while driving. My $50 interim phone had working bluetooth. A $200 phone should have functioning bluetooth as well.",Bad

When I tried to type on the Keyboard on the Slider, It was Kind of Hard to type, The only way that you can Type is by using your Fingernails. The sides and the Screen was all Scratched up. The Keypad was Sort of Brown, Not White. It Wont let me download any games, & The Navigation on the Phone won't Work. Some Sounds on the Phone sounds to Crazy and Not Calm.

My husband purchased it. HIs comments are: OK so everyone is entitled to one mistake. This was mine. Should have read the reviews more closely. The wrist strap is way to small. The instruction manual is less than useless. Can't get the ring tone volume to increase. Unless you are tech savvy I would not buy it. Gave it one extra star because the mp3 player worked. ( Had to buy Bluetooth head phones and keep the watch in my pocket.),Bad
"Not water proof! It says it is, but I can confirm it's not (see picture). I did put it through the paces and actually took it in the water, but nothing out side it's advertised capability. This phone is a good phone, but I don't like companies who advertise something they don't back up. I contacted Sony and they told me that water damage was not covered under the warranty. So now I have a bricked phone that I used according to how the company intended it to be used and there's nothing I can do about it. Thanks Sony.",Bad
"I had to send this phone back to the seller. It was dirty when I got it, so I thought, since it less than $40 a little clean up wasn't bad. Also the slider to open the keyboard was sticking. Had to really clean that part of the phone?? I set the phone up, and was ready to use it. The last thing I tried to do was call out. Everything was good except for that very important feature.Live and learn.",Bad

Now I have extremely limited usage of the phone (just calling and texting), can't add contacts, forward texts/access contacts/make calls without sliding it open... it's now just a pain in the a** that's relocated to my front pocket. It only got the extra star because it at least is marginally useful without the touchscreen. Barely.",Bad

"I've been a blackberry user for years, primarily because I'm not a touch screen user when emailing and sending texts. I like the feel of a keyboard. A few months after having this unit the keys started falling off. I now do not have an 'E' or ""D' key. I bought another keypad and apparently didn't have all the right tools to replace so I'm still stuck using my small finger or a pen to activate the E and D keys. Obviously this makes for slow typing. If you are a heavy user of the keypad I would be careful with this model. Looks like I will have to take it to a repair shop now.",Bad
Put two dents on the back of my phone. rubbed off the color/paint of iphone.,Bad
"At first, this phone was fantastic. Two months later, I started having these crazy moments where the screen seems to act like I was tapping over and over in random places. I noticed that the behavior seemed to occur more often when the phone was warm.

Too bad, I loved everything else about this phone.[...]",Bad
"My 1st review of this phone was that it was a good phone and that it works with consumer cellular. Since I've now had this phone for 8 months I have now downgraded by rating of this phone. 1st the plastic around the charger port has broken away however, I am still able to charge and use phone. 2ndly some functions of this phone does not work using the consumer cellular mobile network. I can't access the internet nor can I access my email on their network. If I use WIFI I can access the internet , facebook, email etc... So I only use WIFI, not consumer's mobile network. The phone is configured to their instructions to use their data plan. Still doesn't support this phone. This phone is AT&T capatable, still, not all functions is supported. Too Bad!",Bad

"This was a good phone. The touch was amazing, the response was quick and it was overall really good.However, the internet capabilities (what I bought it for) was not as I expected. It can only work on certain 3G nextworks.MAJOR FLAW and the reason I returned it was the reception. It would always show full network signal bars but it would not receive certain calls. Callers always complained about having to try several times or had to use other methods.Despite it's good looks, performance and it's build, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. (And why else would you want a phone?)",Bad
The phone is in great shape very happy known Nick's dings or cracks almost like new. Except that the battery life is extremely short. Having to charge at least 2 to 3 times per day I guess I'll have to get a new battery.,Bad
Great phone but CANT BE UPDATED TO THE NEW SOFTWARE. CHECK THE SOFTWARE AND MAKE SURE YOU LIKE IT CAUSE YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH IT UNTIL YOU GET ANOTHER PHONE. I TRIED EVERYTHING!!!,Bad
They did not mention at all that it was the older slide version of the phone and I was disappointed with my order!,Bad
"The phone works okay, however the battery was crap. It also isn't a pop out and replace battery, it is one that requires taking the phone completely apart (heat gun, screw drivers, other tools), so you run the risk of damaging it if you do it your self, or it costs $85 locally to replace. Which is the cost of the damn phone to begin with. Buy a different phone and save yourself the trouble!",Bad
It came without an instruction manual. I'm not familiar with this type phone so I'm learning by trial and error. A manual would have been extremely helpful. I'm currently looking for a tutorial.,Bad

I do not like this. and I cant get a new battery s there is no place to put this in. I would like seller to contact me since this is on warranty please. I loved this phone when I first got it and am truly disappointed that the battery life is less now ? why>?,Bad
I am very unhappy with this purchase. I've had to charge this phone at minimum twice a day and if you like to use apps than much more charging would be required.,Bad
"OK, I was very excited about this phone after watching lots of reviews about it.mainly about 4K ,camera 3GB ram desinge and built quality.in the past i used Note 4-iphone 6 plus and currently using nokia 1520.I have to say i was very disappointed with the screen resolution , I watched many videos including 4K & 8k (yes some 8K videos are avilable now).and it looks poor , note 4 is much looks so much better and 6 plus and Nokia 1520 are still better .screen is not sharp to be 4k at all and hardly looks like 1080.looks dark even after adjusting display.camera is ok. but my 1520 is far better image quality.that is probably cause Flash in 1520 is so much better than the one in Sony .Design and size is the best thing bout this phone , other than that nothing impressive.I decided to return it and go with note 5.Too bad Nokia stooped making phones any more.",Bad
"I thought I was upgrading and getting a good deal but I found out that the phone has connection problems constantly, drops calls, has network problems and you can't get through to Boost to find or correct the problem. The phone requires a degree to work and don't even talk about adding apps. That is a joke. It is just too hard to handle. Boost has gotten worse as far as a network, connection and system assistance is concerned. Boost is the worst, next to AT&T. Won't to send back but haven't had the time. My old phone is just has hankty working. Constantly drops calls, doesn't pick up calls, slow on messages, text may get to you in a day or so after you have already talked to that person if u can get through. In an emergency, this phone would leave you DEAD! YOU WOULD NOT HAVE A CHANGE TO LIVE WITH BOOST AS YOUR PHONE SERVICE IN ST. LOUIS, MO.",Bad
"the phone is presented many probleas the screen is frozen does nothing and should restart it , the other thing is that when I take a picture leaves a red stain on the image and what I read is a burned pixel , now as I get I recognize the guarantee of the equipment was expensive, I am very disappointed",Bad
AFTER I PUT THE SIM CARD IN AND THEN THE BATTERY I ONLY GET SERVICE UNTIL I MOVE IT OR TRY TO USE IT. THEN I HAVE REMOVE THE BATTERY AND REINSERT THE SIM. IT HAS BEEN A VERY BIG DISAPOINTMENHT. I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF A WATCH PHONE THOUGH. I AM IN BELIZE NOW WHERE I RECEIVED THE WATCH NOW I CAN'T RETURN IT.,Bad
phone was the cheaper version and was not the quality that I had in my first boulder phone I purchased!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Bad
"I begin by saying that I have usually been a Samsung cell phone fan. Not this time, however. I have now had this phone for not even a year and a half and it has had issues from the start. I have never been able to use the speaker phone function. I can hear fine, but my voice does not get picked up. It is the same even when I hold the phone close to my mouth when NOT in speaker mode. So there has always been something wrong with the mic, but not seriously enough for this to be covered under warranty. These days my phone will not even call out some times. I have to restart the phone in order for it to work again. The apps and the size and the note function are all great, but this particular phone has been a bit of a dud, almost like a lemon. I am sad to say that I might get an iPhone 6 next time since my girlfriend has one and has not had any problems at all with it.",Bad
"Needs stylus pen to write with sometimes, words too small to use fingers on LCD Screen. Sometimes the touch screen don't response to your finger tips. I do not care for it's menu its not friendly. Pix is ok. Receiving and calling is OK, no drop calls or interference.",Bad
"The phone was fine except that within a week of having the phone it began to have problems charging...I bought several charges thinking that was the problem. It however was not the issue, it was the phone itself. I do not reccomend the item due to the fact that it was defective.",Bad
The only nice thing about the phone is the camera. The bad includes the updates rendering the phone full of flaw. You can experience the update to Windows 8 having the chance to corrupt the rear facing camera. The chance to have the backlight turn deep blue. Also the possibility of the keyboard being stuck in Chinese.,Bad
I buyed two smart phone but one phone present problem because don't run. Only say lenovo in the home screen. Please say me what i can do,Bad
Very good phone but more damage than like new. And didn't include back cover or charger so cost more than it seen.,Bad
"was not worth the purchase plan; it has no more features then an android phone, and for a 3G it moves rather slow",Bad
"Looks nice, but ""buggy"". Would have to take out card and battery and start over again. Got tired of it. Put it up and got out my old one!",Bad
"Liked phone. It was sold as new, but I had reservation due some problems with use. I had to return it.",Bad
"good price, but thats about it. Bought the phone in April, already having to have warranty work done on it. Keeps restarting after use of google maps or any other app running in the background. But wait......BLU RMA policies are a joke. Not only must you deal with long call times, but you must return device.........with no replacement, or loaner device for 15-20 days. thats their policy as told by BLU worker. Their customer service is just as bad as their devices.",Bad
Had to return this phone as the s/w kept defaulting back to Italian as the language despite repeatedly correcting it in the system settings! I understand from some responses that this is not an uncommon issue. I think those that are building these need some more practice...,Bad
"About this phone? My issues battery life really bad need to charges it twice a day! I don't have games on my phone,no fb. I only use my phone text and calling. I got this phone March 31,2016. And camera so blurry Specially front camera dark. Nothing special on this phone, only the style and the color will fool you. Now I'm thinking buying another phone that I don't need to charge twice a day. You get what you pay for...I wish the battery life at least last 1 day..I don't really care much about camera.",Bad
