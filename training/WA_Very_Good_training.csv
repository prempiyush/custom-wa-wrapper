"The phone came in a very nice condition, came in a Generic Motorola box, not original packaging tho, just a generic fitting. If you are looking to get an original OEM box with your product you might not be so lucky, however the phone its in great condition, came with Android 2.3.4 , it didn't come completely unlocked, I used 2 different international SIM cards and they did not detect, I did a wipe out, then after it reboot I then checked for updates using the LG MOBILE SUPPORT TOOL,it found an update to ICS, went for it, and after it it was completely unlocked, both SIM were detected working flawlessly.I was pretty lucky to not mess too much with installing things manually.",Very_Good
"As with all otterboxes, it is yet another great case. The built in screen protector and hard cover keep my Note 10.1 safe from falls and when I toss it into my bag.",Very_Good

"I use it in Venezuela with movistar and works perfectly. I have had an iphone 4s, htc one x, windows lumia 520 but just couldn't adapt to the virtual keyboards.having used a BB 8900,9000,9700,9360,9630 8120,9500 I grew tired of the blackberry OS always freezing, the useless web browser, the lack of apps, etc.the Q10 delivers in all those aspects, the keyboard is awesome the best I have ever used, the screen is great for its size, the OS is super fast and now we have the android apps available.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone about a 3 weeks ago and let me tell ya that this is an amazing buy for the price... This phone, although smaller trumps my fathers Sony Ericsson Xperia arc s by a good dealKeyboard- pretty good (not apple quality) but it surpasses other competitors futhermore it has a swype like text entering system that is pretty coolMusic-amazing clarity and crisp bass about sums it upprocessing speed is quite fast and the ICS update works without glitches(for now):)Sony s own touches to the phone really makes u wanna use it just to see the screenBattery life aint that good but will last a day with heavy internet usage and probably 2 if ure lucky:) but terrible battery life is the norm for smartphones so I can live with that! Overall its a good buy and extremely worth it!",Very_Good
It's best features for me are that it will work on European networks and it has slots for 2 SIM cards that you can switch between. Comes with a variety of built in apps.,Very_Good
"This is a great deal on an Otter Box, $20! It protects like a champ and the color isn't like every other iPhone case out there.",Very_Good
"I am not very tech savvy and this is my second smart phone so I was a little nervous about buying an unlocked international phone as I didn't know exactly what that meant. I live in the United States so I had to buy another phone charger as the one that came with the phone does not fit in a US outlet. You can however, disconnect the plug and use it to charge on your computer. I went from a Galaxy S II to this and I have a Straight Talk Plan. I had to search on youtube how to get it set up through Straight Talk...apparently I had to turn the airplaine mode on and back off before I could use the internet?? Strange but it worked. Now that I have everything set up I love the phone!! Internet and videos are a lot faster and smoother with my new phone. I love it and would highly recommend it! Happy Customer :)",Very_Good
"My phone was delivered in black, not white, but that's a minor issue. Overall this is a decent sized, simple and instinctive phone for a price that can't be beat.

My iphone was stolen and I needed to replace it. This was a great price. Came in earlier than estimated. And the scratch that was on the back I couldn't even find. It looks brand new.,Very_Good
"Brand new.I really like this phone and am looking forward to updates.I used to have a moto g3, so this is an upgrade for me.One thing that sucks though is the speaker.This phone has one front facing speaker and it's terrible. My moto G's speaker sounded better.I was expecting this since I watched reviews on YouTube, but I was hoping that it would at least as good as my moto(Nope).Also the battery doesn't seem to be all that great.This has a larger battery than my moto g, but it seems like my moto G's battery lasted a lot longer.Oh.. and the USB type C charging cable is really short.Aside from those 3 things the phone is great, pretty, and super smooth.Oh yeah. Reading someone else's review reminded me.. The headphone jack. When you plug in your headphones it might seem loose, but that just means that it isn't in all the way. You may think you'll break it, but trust me you won't. I thought there was something wrong with mine until I googled this problem.",Very_Good
My 91 year old aunt loves it! She needed a basic flip phone and this was perfect!,Very_Good
"I will never again buy a phone through a cell service provider. Buying unlocked through Amazon or some other reputable source saves you about 20%, and here's the really great part: no bloatware! Be careful to ensure that the phone will work with your service provider, but if it will this is the way to go without a doubt.",Very_Good
I lkied it so much. it was exactly as it was published. When I opened it I did not belive it. it was very new.,Very_Good

"Great phone. This is a the best phone I have ever owned. It worked well in the USA and the Caribbean (Trinidad/ Barbados) I was considering choosing the Samsung galaxy s6 but I did not like the idea of not being able to expand the memory. I am glad that I choose the note 4. Battery life is good and when need to, charges quickly.",Very_Good
At the original price of $65 or $70 I probably would not have bought this case but for $20 this thing is well worth it. I can let my wife use the tablet and not be scared that she's going to break it anymore because this thing is extremely strong and rugged.The snap on stand doubles as a screen protector whenever you want to store the tablet on the go and it doubles as the perfect stand to set the tablet on while watching shows in your bed or on the table.It's really the perfect case at $20.,Very_Good
"I have to give this 50 thumbs up product flawless,I had a Lil problem with the a part of the charger that was missing and they responded right,their service is awwwweessoommeee I would but my newfrom them if it was being sold lol. Excellent jobs guys thank a mill",Very_Good
"The product page explains it, I mean there's really not much more to say about it. Although one feature I didn't pay attention to, the flashlight (push the spacebar button for a second while unlocked, or hold it down when it's locked) is really bright. It's actually the flash for the camera too.",Very_Good
I purchased this phone and it has not failed me since. I absolutely love it a way better upgrade than my previous phone!,Very_Good
"Had some trouble getting the right settings for Consumer Cellular (their fault, not BLU's), however, once set up, phone has met expectations set by the specifications. Great mid-range unlocked handset for those looking for something in between very poor entry level Android's offered by pre-paid companies, and breaking the bank on a flagship device. Wasn't even aware that it came with a perfect starter case (and mediocre screen protector) which was a great surprise.",Very_Good
"This phone is fantastic. May be the best phone I've own so far. The only con is the camera. It falls little short with the competition. But everything else is awsome. The look, the feel in the palm of your hand is very nice. It feels very premium. And the boom sound in the front speakers is the best in the smartphone matket right now. In conclusion, this phone is one of the best in 2014. Heavily recommended.",Very_Good
"I am on a long-term assignment away from home, so for Christmas I sent my wife the latest Blackberry that just came out, the Blackberry Bold 9700 (Unlocked). Being out of the country, I haven't seen it, or used it, but I can offer a ""thumbs-up"" from her point of view. Every time I talk to her she brags about it and keeps telling me ""You have to get one, you have to get one!""",Very_Good

"I had an HTC Incredible2 with my cell phone compamny but it wouldn't work with Consumer Cellular whose programs better suits my limited needs for a cell phone. This phone has everything I wanted -- my little computer when I am away from home. It takes great photos, particularly outside. The Incredible2 took better flash photos.",Very_Good
"Excellent phone, unlocked, and delivered very fast. First i was worried if they would ship to india, but they did and the phone itself is super awesome, better than any iphone or samsung phones u can get your hands on.This has 4k resolution, 4k video recording, 13 megapixel camera, awesome night cam, ire blaster universal remote, and everything you could possibly want. This is a DSLR, Movie camera, universal remote, 4k tv, phone, all rolled into one.The only downside if any, is that the sound while playing movies is a little low, and will be hard to hear without headphones in crowded places.For this price, i would say buy this phone as fast as u can. Thinking about buying another one for my friend.",Very_Good
I was really happy with this purchase. I did not really know what to expected but it was easy to setup and use. Im glad i did not waste additional 100 dollars are the cell phone store.,Very_Good

My Note II works really well, it is small and bign enough, i got all the apps I need, the battery works really well,..., Great!",Very_Good
"I have had this phone before, and I did try to replace it. I was thrilled to see it finally on Amazon. This phone is small enough to fit in your pocket or clutch purse. Needed to have raised buttons, which is hard to find nowadays in a phone. All the bottons are raised. Easy to operate and has many features. I even bought a skin for it, many to choose from for this phone, to make it unique to me. I would recommend this phone to anyone.",Very_Good

"Arrived about a week after ordering. Placed my SD (32g) and Sim card in, my service (T-Mobile) works perfectly. I didnt have to call customer service or anything. It allows you to choose your language as soon as you turn on the phone for the first time. My only issue is that I payed the extra, what, $20, for the black leather? And I'm not really sure it was worth it, I'm pretty sure its plastic. But its a great phone. Camera quality is great, simple to use. Totally worth the $218.",Very_Good

"Upgraded from the Z3 Compact, please Sony, never stop making compact phones. I hate the bigger ones!! 720p on this screen looks crystal clear and is all you really need. It's a very powerful phone, no slow downs at all. It does get a little hot though, with a case I don't feel its heat as much. The removal of the flap that covered the USB port on the Z3 compact was a nice touch, although it does scare me that they decided to stop advertising taking it under water, not that I do that often.",Very_Good
"This product is without any doubt an excellent option to buy. In fact, is very easy to add ringtones in this cell phone. And finally, the most important is the price",Very_Good
"Stock android delivers on exactly what I expected from the phone. 128GB is good enough for my music needs. Front facing speakers are good for a phone. With a decent case, I'm able to manage the phone even with small hands. Fingerprint reader works well. Camera quality is good, but maybe a bit slow. This is offset by the excellent camera app with lots of software modes. Battery life is excellent, and I rarely need to charge the phone during the day.I really wish that it had a memory card slot for expansion (as opposed to large internal memory), but it's OK. Phone seems a tad bit fragile, so I feel a decent case is a must. It's big, so sometimes it's awkward to fit in a pocket.",Very_Good
"Can't imagine a better phone for this price. Amazing pics with both cameras, very responsive, light, slim, love the design",Very_Good
"It is a tiny bit bigger than the Samsung Galaxy phone, and does everything my Samsung did. My only complaint was the I was not able to order a good case for it, so just ended up with a Gel Skin.",Very_Good
The phone was actually in a lot better condition than I expected. Fast shipping and everything was smooth. Repeat customer for sure whenever I'm in the market for another device.,Very_Good
"Phone came in within seven days, and in perfect condition. I am normally very cautious about buying used phones, but I am more than satisfied with this purchase. Its unlocked, in original packaging, along with charger and USB cable. There are Minor blemishes, but hardly noticeable. But other than that, phone runs smoothly, and there are no complications. Would definitely recommend purchasing.Works with straight talk, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. All you need is a SIM card that is compatible for this particular phone, but those only cost around $6.00.",Very_Good
This is my second one of these phones. A button on my first broke after 6 years and made it difficult to use. I only use a phone for calling and texting. I tried a couple other phones but came back to this one. It's good quality and so far (after one week) is working great. `,Very_Good

"iPhone works great and was brand new as advertised. The box was a little bruised from shipping, but overall great. There was a little bit of a scare with the touch screen when I first got it, it lagged a little but i'll chalk that up to the fact that its 128g and an iPhone problem, but it seems to have ironed out and is working great now. I live in Guam and my sim card worked great, so I can assume that it's fully unlocked as advertised. Arrived early and I'm very happy with this product. Thank you.",Very_Good
"phone works great, just wish there was a way to disable the PTT button on the side as it is easy to push when getting the phone out of a case.",Very_Good

This phone beat my expectations. It small and light it actually not to slow . Google maps worked great.,Very_Good
Comes with all the basics needed to be satisfies with a smartphone. Supports up to a 32 GB Micro SD card (which i bought for it) and runs seamlessly. There's no reason you SHOULDN'T get this phone. Big apps (>120MB) are a bit sluggish but that's to be expected. Buy the s***. it's only like $55 on here.,Very_Good
"I bought this phone for my stepmother to replace a cheap MetroPCS she had. The screen is good for a budget phone and has a slight color shift from different angle but it isn't a big deal to her but don't expect it to be as vibrant as a more expensive IPS or AMOLED screen. The sound is great and loud but sounds distorted if played at the maximum volume. It seems quick enough for regular use and I have no complaints.+ good quality and feel+ inexpensive and good simple design+ easy to activate with MetroPCS (you can activate it just by calling them and talking to support. It's free)+ the battery should last a whole day with fair use+/- the speaker is loud but sounds ""scratchy"" at it's maximum volume+/- screen quality is ok because of its color shift at angles, but for its price its goodno cons because I bought a budget phone and I knew what to expect (9/10 for value)",Very_Good

"I cant believe how unnoticed this phone been. Im glad i got this and not the G Pro2 coming out for i really don't need a finger print scanner. then again im sure it has better specs but its a phone what more do u need. I play all emulators on it just fine on the phone i have now. However the speaker phone sucks... whats the point of it if u need to be by your phone for people to hear u. non the less I should invest in a Bluetooth headset.the batery life is ok. @ 100% screen brightness, face booking, playing a game , and web surfing, the battery last about 7hours during during one of my endurance test.",Very_Good

It was a nice phone, but I have to say the performance of this, the beautiful screen and most of all...the incredible sound that comes from the front-facing speakers...all add up quite a package.Nice surprises:- beautiful design that feels well-built and looks great...feels good in hand- Infrared blaster built into the power button can learn other remotes- Camera performance is great and fast!- Different editing features for photos are fun and some are useful- Gaming performance is great- Call quality is goodOther Notes:- There is no multi-tasking app button, you have to tap the home button twice instead...it's not so bad once you get used to it- Power button is in a weird spot",Very_Good

So far the phone is great! The phone is bigger then I thought it would be and the battery holds up for a long time. I charged the phone up to 100% at 4 pm now it is 12:37 and the battery is at 12%. But I been on the phone since it was charged up doing everything on it you can think of. So far this a great phone for the price. Pros. Pro 1. The phone is large and haves a nice screen. Pros 2. The phone battery lasts a long time. Pro 3. The price you pay for the phone is great. Pro 4. The phone call quality is nice and lord when you are talking to anyone on the other end. Pro 5. The picture quality is good but not the best. But good enough for my needs Pro 6 the phone runs fast enough for my needs because I'm not that too much into games on any phones. But it will run Pokemon Go. OK let start with the cons. Con 1. Well the con I can think of now is that the speaker quality is not all that loud when watching YouTube videos. So that's all the cons I have came across right now. I will do update if needed.,Very_Good

"Some people may complain about the fact that it's ""only"" 720p, but seriously, my wife has the S4, and when we compare them side by side, you can't see a difference unless you're about 2 inches from the screen. This phone/tablet is absolutely amazing and has become invaluable to me for work and school. I'm using it constantly and the battery life is absolutely amazing! i've eve got it overclocked to 1.9GHz from the original 1.6GHz and the battery still gets me through an entire day with ease. The screen size if AMAZING! I don't think I can ever go back to a phone with a smaller screen again. When you first get it, it does feel rather large in your hand, but you get used to it in about a day or two tops and then everything else seems really small and almost like a toy. I'm hooked on the galaxy Note series of phones! My Dad has the Note III and it's even more amazing, but it doesn't make me like regret getting this one at all!! I can't wait to see what Samsung does with the Note 4!!! This device is epic!",Very_Good
this is a good phone.i will tell eveyone that this phone is a great phoneyes i would get anther one someday,Very_Good
Let's be honest $129 for a phone with a 5.5 inch screen is a deal octa core but let me tell you im a heavy gamer from ashphalt 8 to grand theft auto ive played them for hours on this screen and it barely hit 45% but ill tell you after moderate to heavy use i have a days worth of battery i love this phone youll enjoy it . the whole option of dual sims make it a better buy one for data and other for voice and minutes heavenly bliss didn't get mine my ups guy may have lost it blue refunded me the money I went and bought it off eBay I'm using it on net10,Very_Good

This was a used phone however it seems to work very well haven't had any problems with it. I really like it.,Very_Good
"Awesome phone for the price. Was WAY bigger than I expected though, probably would have gone with a different phone if I had known how big it was. But it runs fast, has decent battery life, nice interface, nice support, has a great camera, great ASUS quality that I've come to expect from the company. I do wish it were a bit louder though",Very_Good
My daughter loves the phone. It is very easy to text with it. She also likes the way that it looks. I liked the price. It was very reasonable.,Very_Good

Works great. Had a small problem with the wrong power cord. The seller quickly sent the right cord. Bottom line is i'm very happy with the phone and the seller.,Very_Good
"I know you probably have read a lot of reviews on this phone. I am not a technical person. I just needed a phone. I was very careful about this purchase because the reviews on here warn you if you would just read them. From my contact with the seller at the very outset I knew this would be a good purchase. Exactly as described, brand new unlocked phone in the box. Awesome",Very_Good
The product arrived on time and it was working as expectedThe price was goo I'm happy with this product,Very_Good
"This is my first smartphone and I am very satisfied with it. The sound quality is good. I have no problem hearing others and the folks that I have called have said that I am clear on their end. I get the same reception that I had on my previous non-smart phone (2 bars in my home - 5 bars where I work).I had no trouble configuring email, wifi, and mobile data (I am using the phone with Straight Talk so I needed to set up their APN). This phone is big. I generally keep it in my right front pants pocket. In some dress slacks that are a little loose, it is noticeable that there is a bulky object in my pocket. I love having the large screen, though. It makes reading things on the screen much easier. The delivery was fast, arriving 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Overall, I am extremely satisfied.",Very_Good
"its your standard phone, it gets the job done. Only english and spanish language available on phone. i receive messages in my mother tongue and it just displays symbols (annoying). Its your basic call and text phone. small memory. Fast delivery and complete with all accessories.Rating is 5 star for the seller because the product is the same as described.However, i give the phone company (posh) a 3 star (as an okay) phone. it could be better than that.",Very_Good
Was purchased as gifts for 2 friends of mine and they simply love these phones. Samsung Galaxy S3 is great!,Very_Good

The phone works great and much cheaper than the roaming charges associated with a US cell phone while traveling in Europe. It works great in places where there is no cell reception.,Very_Good
"Very nicely designed and easy to use. Here in NJ, there were places where I couldn't get a signal with my previous cell phone, but my Jitterbug works fine everywhere I go. I purchased my Jitterbug from Amazon but had no trouble getting it activated through GreatCall. GreatCall's customer service has been very good. This is a no-contract phone, so I can easily cancel if they don't give me good service, but so far I've been very happy with both the phone and the service.",Very_Good
"Excellent phone. Very well built, and quite easy to unlock the boot loader (htc dev), for those that are concerned with that. The phone feels about the same size as an iPhone in your hand.",Very_Good

"I had the original envy's and LG makes such a good product. It is sturdy and very functional, plus Verizon will not charge you a data charge with these phones!! This makes everyone happy, except maybe Verizon.",Very_Good
"My 3 previous cellphones were: Nexus 4, Nexus 4 (fist one had screen broken after a fall), Moto X Dev Edtion, Sony Xpezia Z1. What I can tell you is once you have a Moto X you get spoiled by all the Active Display and Wakeup features, that's why I mainly replace my Z1 by the HTC One M8. Device is beautiful, finish gorgeous. As for the UI, best closest to the Pure Android Experience.I'm not a big fan of Cam, so I really don't care about the downgrade from a 20.3 mp to a 4mp. The picture quality are good enough, bright, alive to share with others in smartphones or computers. Zoe is excellent, Boomsound is amazing comparing to the crappy sound/speakers from the Z1.If you're looking for a camera, by a Z1 or Z2. if you're looking for a nice smartphone, with nice UI and features, 6months screen replace for free, then get this HTC One. In my personal opening, the form facto is far superior to the Z1. Only Moto X, can compete because of the curve back.",Very_Good
"Because of extensive traveling, I find the unlocked version a must. A little more expensive but worth the extra cost. I would highly recommend this phone to my friends.",Very_Good
Fast delivery and item is better then described! Awesome phone! Thank youwould absolutely buy from seller again!Sandy Phoenix -Jupiter,Very_Good

"pros:performance, great bright display, very nice camera, exceptional battery life, the wake on double tap feature is nice.cons:a real finger print magnet, the button location can be frustrating at first (on the back of the phone).I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a fast phone with a large display and great battery life.",Very_Good

"So i got this phone in replace of my lg ally android phone that i didnt like. so i get this phone and it is awesome, there are days where the battery will last all day long, then there are days where i use it all day and it dies bout halfway through my day, thats only happened once tho. i love this phone. idk why people have so many bad reviews. if you dont know how to work the phone dont get it. the only thing i dont like is that it had a system update and updated on its own and i was used to the way it was before the update. and i had to reset it a couple of times cuz of the keyboard doing weird things. all in all its an awesome amazing phone and i would recommend to anyone. by the way my bf has the same one",Very_Good
"This is a really nice phone. Great feel in your hands; great looks. It's super fast with its octa-core processor, just adding to its overall smoothness, complementing the physical design. I hear that the GPU (graphics processing unit) isn't as zippy as the one in Samsung's S6. But, I don't use it for gaming. Might use it for videos down the road. It's like a very small phablet, light enough that you can hold it for an hour or more late at night if you want to catch up on reading or dash off emails you couldn't get to during the day. The screen is super sharp! I've used it heavily on wifi for 2-3 hours at a time, which only drains the battery about 30%. Not bad. What a phone!",Very_Good
Even though this is a AT&T phone it will still work with a T-Mobile SIM card. It's overall a great phone and came brand new. I was a little doubtful after reading the reviews but the phone comes in perfect condition in the box.,Very_Good
"Very good device, gripping it can be tricky though as the edges are so thin and the phone itself so slippery smooth.Rear Camera is excellent, phone performance is speedy, front facing camera is good but seems to remove blemishes through some kind of inbuit filter, video recording is quite satisfactory.Definitely get a screen protector and case. The bezel can be damaged easily and somehow... in the first 2 weeks of having it the edge screen on the left got some hairline scratches. Thankfully you can't see it with the screen protector applied.Biggest flaws with the phone are no SD Card slot and no water resistence.",Very_Good
"Like new, no visible wear and is working wonderfully. Comes with a wire and a charger, although not the factory original.",Very_Good
This is my first iPhone and I love it. I've always been droid or blackberry fan but I can honestly say the iPhone has won me over.,Very_Good

Love it. I had 5s that was cracked. So I had to replace the phone. It is just perfect. Looks new.,Very_Good
"The WIndows OS is a pleasant surprise. Very smooth and responsive. The 820 is a great, underrated phone. Although it is considered a mid-level phone, the specs are similar to the top of the line 920. The biggest mid-level feature might be the camera - depends on how avid a photographer you are. For general pictures it works wonderfully. Considering the price/feature set, this phone is hard to beat.Highlights:Pros: Design (not too big); microSD; Carl Zeiss Lens and 8.7MP Camera; 1.5 GHz Snapdragon Processor; 1GB Ram; 4.3-inch AMOLED ScreenCons: Average Battery Life; No Image Stabilization",Very_Good
I love the phone it was used but it looks brand new no complaints I will Definitely Order from them again love it!!!!,Very_Good
"this came in perfect condition, no scratches, no dents dings or anything. Worked great with straight talk using verizons service. My hubbs had service with them on a simless phone we were worried about switching over or looking for one that didnt need a sim . well we took a chance. This does need a sim card to function but the change over from no sim to sim was easy and our number stayed the same. overall I am super pleased with this phone and the seller great job on this i could swear it was brand new :)",Very_Good

"Wow.....Amazing phone. Fast, slick, and the quality of the hardware is great. Only ISSUE i had was the charger stopped working after a week...but it seems like it was the USB C Cord. I contacted ZTE via live chat and they issued a replacement that same day. So its great.",Very_Good
Bought this for my mom's iphone because she isn't too careful when handing her phone. I am pretty sure she dropped in a few times since I got her this case about 3 months ago and the case has been holding up while her phone is still in its original condition! I am very impressed and would definitely recommend this case. It is not too bulky and it provides a great amount of protection.,Very_Good

I'm so glad I got this phone. The only thing was I didn't realize it needs a big SIM card so I was able to get it taken care of at cricket for $25. It's been a pretty good phone so far finding ringtones is slightly complicated but other then that all great has more internal memory then my other phone and love having Cortana _Ù÷ and the camera works great and so do the head phones very convenient for when I'm shopping :) I had trouble when purchasing this but was resolved well.,Very_Good

I was using iPhone for a long time and I'm looking for a small android device that can last me through a day. I'm glad that I stumble upon this Sony Xperia z5 compact.

"The phone was on time, even early. It was beautiful just as described. My brother enjoys it.",Very_Good
"Coming from htc one m9 this phone is a HUGE upgrade across the board, even the audio experience is 5x better, which is saying a lot considering that htc one m9 used to be king of audio. This phone also looks like it was designed by a jewel crafter or watch maker, you have to see it in person to appreciate its beauty. Super fast and fluid, really nice software touches, instant fingerprint sensor (can store 5 fingers). AMAZING display, this phone easily goes toe to toe with the s7, and in my opinion is a good bit better then LG g5, EASILY BEATS HTC 10, oneplus3, etc. The s7 is really its only competition, and at this price point there is no comparison.",Very_Good
"I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. The phone works fine and was able to be hooked up with her carrier, Sprint.",Very_Good
"producto de muy buena calidad, el vendedor es muy responsable debido a que respondiÌ_ rÌÁpidamente a mis solicitudes, exelente atencion",Very_Good
This phone has a great antenna that gets great signal wherever I go. It's fast and app storage only limited by the size of the sd card. I use it with an AT&T MVNO and had to do a little hocus pocus to get MMS to work. This one is my 2nd Focus. I just wanted a backup and have invested myself fully into this delightful phone.,Very_Good

"At this price I think that Idole 3 can be considered one of the best smartphones on the market.It is a good device and very easy to handle.PRO: LTE frequencies working with AT&T and other US carriers, Android Lollipop, excellent and brilliant screen, very good cameras (front camera is 8 mp!), excellent stereo speakers, good battery.CON: processor MSM8939 is not fast: avoid multitasking! audio during calls could have a little more clarity.",Very_Good
"This is the first phone I've bought on Amazon. I was kind of leery but the phone came within 2 days, with an estimated 5 to 7 business day shipping expectation. The phone was Verizon ready, no scratches, chips, or any kind of damage on the phone. I love it. And would definitely recommend it.",Very_Good
"The best phone of the moment, it has everything in the same box, neither apple can achive that goal. Apple phones are just screens with icons, useless applications and with middle technology, are just multimedia players with a GUI, not really phones.N97 is the best choice for everyone who wants to have everything in one gadget.",Very_Good
"I have a MacBook Air and an Apple I pad, so I wanted to sync everything together.Don't need a highly technical phone and this fit the bill.",Very_Good

Nokia was years ahead of the rest with this device and anybody who uses Debian would love it. It may not have many of the modern features and development is slower since this device has been discontinued but you will never find another device like it unless the upcoming Ubuntu phones gain traction. This phone takes a bit of know-how to tweak to perfection and if you have the ability then it is very much worth it.Be warned though: all current development is community driven and Nokia has discontinued the device.,Very_Good
"The phone is everything it should be and more. I had to send it back for a defective volume control, which was the fault of the refurbisher and not related to the phone.",Very_Good

"Excellent product, is a great fit. The color is not too bright, and protects the phone and not too bulky to fit in your pocket.",Very_Good
Item works great. Arrived in a timely fahison as well. SD card randomly says it was removed. But its a 3 year old phone.,Very_Good
"Pluses:Price: about $100 (can't believe this much phone for the money)Display: 1080P while it's not AMOLED, really pretty for the $Sound: stereo speakers rock. Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop ""full battery"" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users.",Very_Good
"I had this phone for many years and the battery was running out and back starting to refuse to stay on. I search the web for a basic phone with no data package included. This could be a smart phone, but I use my phone for texting or calling people. I don't want Facebook posts on it, I don't want emails, I have a great camera. Now I have a great phone! Its small but what I really love is the slider that pulls out, it makes texting so easier and I love the alarm clock! So do I love it? Yes and you would to even if you wanted a smart phone, this could be one...small but quite easy to use andlasted me 6 or 7 years with lots of use. Give it a try!",Very_Good
I purchased this phone for my 75 year old mother...she likes it very much...and has started to use the various features. Nice phone!,Very_Good

"I had this phone for a few weeks and it is a quality phone. I don't play extreme games on my phone, hence no need for the expensive phone. I am a blackberry phone user that can switch brand phones at any time. For now, this is the phone for me.",Very_Good
"Phone is great! It was a huge upgrade for me going from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge. :) No problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! I love the camera! The seller (Wireless Everything) was even kind enough to even include a US wall adapter along with the order.",Very_Good

"Purchased it for my husband. I have a Firephone for myself and talked him finally to get rid of his I-Phone as well. No more contracts and better service. Anyway, since you could no longer buy the Firephone I decided on this one as it looked like a great deal for the money and wow, was it ever. We are now on H2o and saving lots of money. This phone does everything and more. It is more intuitive than the I-phone so even a couple of old fogies like us can figure it out. Takes great pictures. Good size screen, volume could be louder but not too bad.",Very_Good
"In some simple words, this phone is so nice, fast and cheap! I totally recommend it for everyone who enjoys android :-)",Very_Good
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",Very_Good
This phone is big like really big its almost as big as a mini iPad and the phone is 7.5 its not a 7.0 but I love it,Very_Good
This phone does all that a basic user of smart phones could want. The memory is smaller then most put perfectly sized for those who do not need gaming and other big application use draws. I find this phone works fine and gets the job done without the price of the other larger priced phones.,Very_Good
I am very impressed with the quality and performance of this Iphone 6. I bought this for my teenage son and he won't put it down. So it was a very good buy and I would buy one again from this seller.,Very_Good
Works great just one thing u can't download no apps it won't download it's good for basics text talk pic meghase,Very_Good
"It is smaller than I see the younger generation using but it gives us a great opportunity to learn how to use the new phone systems. Samsung is known for a high standard and quality and this phone meets that perfectly. The same or similar apps are used on this phone as on the larger galaxy phones for one third the price or less. That makes this a great phone to upgrade to, I am glad we did.I bought one for my wife and myself. Give it a try and if you want upgrade to the larger phone this one makes a good backup one for later. Go ahead and try one. Hope this helps your decision process. Enjoy",Very_Good

"This is an awesome phone, even in the day of touch-screen enabled, octa-core-processor-driven monster phablets. I have owned Android- and Windows phones as well as older blackberries. The reason I went back to a Blackberry was because of its enhanced security in the age of malware that has penetrated Android and iOS devices. Battery life is much better on this devices as well. In addition, the phone does not encounter crashes and random restarts like the other aforementioned devices that most people own. Sure there are not as many apps, but isn't that what tablets and PCs are for? Having a physical keyboard is a plus too, since it allows more accurate typing.",Very_Good
"I am loving this phone. I am not much of a tech guy. So i am slow to learn alot of features the phone has, but then instruction are in plain speak. Thank you.",Very_Good

Numbers Blacklist, Record calls etc)Comes with 2 cases, ear budsturbo chargingCons:battery life is not that greatMissing T-Mobile 4G band 12not for people with small handsNot many accessories for it yetSmall annoyance - automatically sets ""Silence Mode"" on your phone when you start to video, awesome! Doesn't turn off silence mode once the camera app is closed, not awesome!I would/have recommend it and would buy again",Very_Good
"This item was exactly as advertised-in perfect condition, no scratches, and works perfectly. I intended to buy a 4S, but the 4 is great and Siri is not really necessary.",Very_Good
"This is the kind of phone that I love. Has a good camera, processor, memory, screen. And is perfect if you are using European Bands (3G=900) like Digitel's ones, I haven't tested on 4G yet. Is a really good and relative cheap phone. The biggest problem is that is easy to get scratches on the screen",Very_Good
"This is a great phone.As for the space, out of the box I had 1.09 GB used of 10.67 GB available, and the memory indicated 1.8 GB total with 1.0 GB in use.Physically I really like how light weight it is.I installed a lot of apps and it still feels super fast and responsive.",Very_Good
I got no problem. With all the complete information. And this going great . I therefore recommend purchase.,Very_Good
Thanks a lot to the seller I feel happy whit the product that I bought it ..,Very_Good
"I never had a smartphone but decided to dump Verizon and switch to Simple Mobile and try this one. I wasn't sure it would work well with SM after some of the reviews, since it is older and not really for use in the US, but it works just fine. And althought Samsung doesn't support the phone in the US, Amazon supplies a 1-yr warranty free. Can't beat that deal. I've enjoyed the internet capability, GPS, texting, apps, all do just fine. I got a longer lasting battery for $10 and it lasts 2 full days without turning it off. The phone syncs with my computer using Samsung KIES software, also a big plus to manage contact lists, podcasts, and music. At a cost of 1/2 Verizon's monthly costs for phone, text, and internet, I am VERY happy phone and Simple Mobile.So, if you want to get into the new millenium, dump Verizon, get this smartphone, and save money with Simple Mobile.",Very_Good
"Hi, my friend, i live in venezuela and this phone is truly unlocked, i just plug my sim card from movilnet and i make phonne calls to my frienda, thank amazon / hola amigos, yo vivo en venezuela y este telefono es en verdad desbloqueado, solo le conecte un sim card de movilnet al sacarlo de la caja y enseguida pude hacer llamadas a mis amigos, gracias amazon",Very_Good
"Great phone. fast, boot up and apps. the dual sim features are great. Camera is very good. Battery life is also very good. Had it for 2 weeks now, nothing to complain about",Very_Good
"Just wanted to write a quick review. Coming from a Samsung Galaxy s5 that was so buggy and lagged so much I literally folded it in half and a HTC m7 that's battery ran so often I had to constantly keep it plugged in defeating the whole purpose of a cell phone, I have to say this ZTE z max 2 blew me away!!! It functions flawlessly and is more stable than my big name brand Samsung ever was!!! The battery lasts ALL day! Simply put I am amazed at this phone. The only tiny complaint that I have is its inability to accept a 64gb micro SD card but that has really been a non issue anyway.I just can't say enough for such an affordable phone. I've had it for over a month now and it's well built, functions flawlessly, the screen is outstanding, and the battery life is great!!!",Very_Good
I chose this rate because i'm very satisfied.Item arrived new with all features shown on the pictures.Congrats....I would like to recommend it to all my friends.,Very_Good
"Excellent produto. Fast, comfortable, with multiple applications. simple to operate. It was much more than expected but unfortunately was a victim of the underworld and stole my phone",Very_Good
"After figuring out how to aquire the phone number so we could activate it, my granddaughter loved it. The company that sold it was very quick in their response of how to resolve the problem which was a phone call to Verizon. They found the number and then it was able to be activated. Phone works good and although the pics are way better than my android, my granddaughter thought they were somewhat fuzzy. Three weeks later she dropped it and the front screen shattered. We are now waiting for a replacement that I also ordered on Amazon and hoping I can manage to fix without too much difficulty.",Very_Good
"Finally, a full-powered phone that I can actually hold in my very small hands. This phone does everything I need and is one of the very few Android models out there that is not ginormous. I've got kid-sized hands so this is a big deal. Plus it actually fits in my pants pockets.Not super keen on the smaller-than average volume control buttons. But this is a small issue and acceptable tradeoff for the other phone benefits.",Very_Good
"The phone I bought for my father, and is excellent for because its operation is very simple, the keys and the numbers are large, and the sound is clear. Especially for seniors. He is very happy with your new phone.",Very_Good
It works! A great phone at a good price. I don't know why this phone is not sold more commonly in the USA.,Very_Good
"So far so good and without all of the preloaded apps you don't need, keeps a decent charge.....will keep you updated",Very_Good
"i love that phone ,its very nice and the shipping was very fast ,so whoever wanted to purchase an android phone, that one is going to be the best one . thanks amazon",Very_Good
"Great cosmetic condition! Only a small scratch so minimal it's hardly noticeable unless it's viewed on a all-white background. Besides that I received headphones,charger and usb cable. For less than $400 it's a great buy! Thanks and best regards! _Ù÷Ä",Very_Good
"I love this! Not only did the phone come so perfect, but it came in the original box with new headphones, a charger, and one of the outlet cube chargers. The phone did not have a scratch on it either. On top of all this, it shipped so fast! At first, the phone was not fully unlocked, but I emailed her and she completely unlocked the phone for me. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone! I would also buy from this seller again. She was wonderful! (The person who sold it to me was Marsiffer's Book Barn, not this seller).",Very_Good
i reccomend this phone highly.its fast has a gud picture camera works great and i got it really fast...put the sim card in from simple mobile and everything worked,Very_Good
I like the small thin design as it fits neatly in my shirt pocket and meets all my wireless needs.,Very_Good
"Picked this up to use for a teen who isn't ready for a smartphone. It's exactly what it says on the box - a simple basic phone. Makes calls, slows down a teen's text-happy hands (they don't often appreciate those who came before them not having QWERTY input for texting); and does it all in a package that can be readily used with t-mobile's $3/month pay as you go plan. Hard to go wrong when you need something basic that can make a call in an emergency, and last forever doing it.",Very_Good
"I would have given this 5 stars, but because it does not support Android pay I am only giving it 4. Other than that I really love the phone it's fast the graphics are great the battery life is great the bluetooth works well and so overall I'm pleased but I cannot believe the phone with these specifications that has near field communications capability won't support Android pay! That was one of the primary things I was really looking forward to being able to use!Update from 4 stars to a 5 star rating! I contacted Blu Support regarding the issue with Android Pay. They acknowledged the issue and they were able to replicate the same problem on their end. The notified the Blu Software Team and corrected the issue. I'm not sure what they did or if it was just a matter of getting Google to add this new model to their trusted list. Either way the good news is that Android Pay is now working on my awesome, super fast, new Blu Pure XL, and I LOVE IT!!!",Very_Good
this phone is very unique and durable.... and it came early. I love it... i just wish i could upgrade the android version to the latet,Very_Good

Very good product. Exactly how described. Even arrived early which was a very nice surprise. Very pleased with this product.,Very_Good
Im in love with this phone so far arrived right on time the front camera could be a little better but other than that this phone is amazing for the price it comes with the headphones case and charger....The screen is huge ....This phone is better than s4 in my opinion no more spending 100s for phonesI play love wogiz phones,Very_Good
"This is my first smart phone. I bought it because my 19 yr old son suggested it for me. It is very easy to use. I listen to audio books on it. The sound quality is great, better than my iPod or my kindle fire. The sound quality for phone calls is also great, I had a hard time hearing calls on past phones I have owned but no problem with the HTC. I highly recommend it.",Very_Good
Love this phone! Came in brand new condition just as seller stated. Easily connected to Verizon Wireless. I would buy from this seller again. Im absouloutly proud to give 5 stars on this review!,Very_Good

I bought this OtterBox Case as a gift for a friend who purchased her first iPhone! She LOVES her new case.,Very_Good
"Good evening, I write to you this time to inform you that the device does not turn on the screen wanted to verify with you what type of warranty covers this technical failure.",Very_Good
"Greetings, happy with purchase, seller is responsible. I deliver the product on the dates indicated. The product is brand new. Only one complaint, the seller stated in the description that the cell has open the HSDPA GSM 900 and 900 and not true, the product box indicates that only works with 850/1900/2100 bands, in this case to Venezuela with Movistar and Movilnet. They must be aware of the cel Versioned they buy, in my case I8190L. Thank you.",Very_Good

"Far better than my Galaxy s4 or note 2, much better battery and faster than eitherI have a lot of apps, and it is not laggy at all, but I use Nova launcher which is greatThe only negative is that the double tap function often does not work. I don't know if this is a phone issue or Android or Novalauncher.",Very_Good
I lovery my new phone. I just sorry the S7 was not out in blue,Very_Good
"tl;dr: this is a good phone for people that like the Windows os, especially at the current price.I got into Windows phones about 2 years ago after having the Nexus 3 and Nexus 5 android phones. I've used some ""budget"" Windows phones from Nokia and decided to give the 950 a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on Amazon. I liked Windows because I don't use a lot of apps (10-15 usually will do it) and all the ones I do use are on the platform -- if you are an ""app for everything person"" then Windows phones are likely not for you. The Windows 10 os makes *significant* improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated, intelligent system to use. The build quality is at least equal to the Nexus phones and a step up from other Lumias I've used. Overall if you like Windows this is a terrific phone.",Very_Good
Great phone for the cost. Pop the SIM card in and it fired right up!,Very_Good
This phone is a beautiful upgrade from my Samsung avant. It works well with my metro pcs plan.,Very_Good
"Excellent phone, exceeded all my expections. One of the main concerns I had while buying this phone was the battery. But to my surprise it is lasting upto 3 days. Awesome display and camera. This is the best phone I ever had.",Very_Good

Nice product and it is fast. Waiting for offer to buy another one for my friend. Not yet experienced anything negative for the last 3 Months.,Very_Good

"The order arrived in perfect condition and almost on time, you have to try the product to see if it meets the expectations although at first glance shows quality",Very_Good
"Bought the phone for a cousin in Argentina. Works great ! It only needed a local SIM card and started working without any problem. The seller was great, the phone came on time and with all the accessories. Very pleased with this purchase",Very_Good
"I was looking for a ""dumb"" phone with a few bells and whistles and decided to purchase the Sony Ericsson W595 based on other reviews. I have not used the phone yet, so I can not give an opinion other than to say I did spend a lot of time searching for a phone with features I wanted and this phone fit the bill.",Very_Good
"Has all I wanted in a smart phone at a fabulous price. It is just as I expected it to be. I like the size, quality, clarity, and user friendly format.",Very_Good
"The Moto X is one of the greatest Android devices created, in my opinion. The Moto Display and Touchless Control make using the device and breeze and changed the way we use Android forever. (Features like these are being included as of Lollipop, go Google!)Battery life is great. The phone doesn't lag, the screen is a bit over-saturated, but that is expected with AMOLED screens. The phone is a bit small for my taste (coming from a Nexus 5) but it fits in my pocket that way, and with a case, this means the phone is not at risk of being too big.Now it just needs an update to Lollipop, come on Motorola!",Very_Good
"It's an excellent phone and gives a person almost everything needed in terms of communication. The picture quality is excellent, continuous automatic updates from Google Play Store made the application running as easy as it can be. The product was delivered 3 days in advance",Very_Good
This phone came in great condition! Great price and it brings back great memories of owning this phone!,Very_Good
"THE BEST TABLET IN THE MARKET,BUY IT,YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY,MUCH BETTER THAN THE APPLE IT IS 3G AND THE WIFI IS THE BEST IN THE MARKET",Very_Good
This arrived yesterday at 3. I had it setup on Straight Talk by 4. That includes internet and picture messaging. If you cant do this in an hour you shouldn't own unlocked phone. Will chime in in a month or so with how it works over time.,Very_Good
Bought as a replacement for my daughter to use on T-Mobile. Just had to put in the simm card and it rocks!,Very_Good
"Arrived on time, it looks like new! Works great, holds a charge, recharges quickly. Went ahead and ordered one for my husband! After a couple of weeks the home button stopped working. My son pointed out to me that it wasn't an original button, they are refurbished phones so it is not unexpected that the home button would have been repaired. I returned the phone and they issued a refund. I ordered another one from them the same day I shipped the first one back. This replacement phone is working great, holds a charge for a long time, charges quickly, all the buttons work great. When I'm ready to upgrade to a 6 I hope this company has refurbished phones, I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again.",Very_Good
"The iphone 6 is great. Better deal to by from Amazon then get service, vs. getting trapped in a contract. I have the $50 plan with sprint and that's it!",Very_Good
"It's simply the best phone I could have purchased.I am big fan of HTC and was looking forward to getting this new device, I can say they did not disappoint me as it is up to all my expectations.Totally recommend this phone.",Very_Good
"This is my first smartphone, so I don't know too much about the technicalities, but I like it. The interface is similar to the ipod/iphone with a few differences. It's pretty easy to use and very customizable. I read in other reviews that it doesn't have much memory, so I bought a 16GB microSD card for it. I've had a few issues with apps crashing, but for my simple purposes (facebook, calling, texting, a few games, calendar, alarm, camera), it is perfect.",Very_Good
"very good phone, good quality not very durable in terms of its material but excelente by price, internally it is a very fast phone, I love this phone blu ...the negative, the camera is not very good, I thought it would take better photos, excelente other equipment is recommended ..Venezuelan operators is released for something positive ...3g",Very_Good
"One of the best phones ever made. From the screen to the battery life, so much of this phone is exceptional. However, its software leaves something to be desired unless if you've always had a Samsung phone. Android purists need not apply. Also, the speaker is pretty weak, but aside from that this is one of the best Android phones on the market. Not much different from the Note 7.",Very_Good
"good I have a problem with the order I, RIM Blackberry Bold 9000 (Unlocked) - Black does not arrive to the address listed intended need to know if you have any other order that I can find the product thank you very much",Very_Good
"Only one thing to say to tell how great this case is. A car ran over my phone with this case on. Maybe the downside was that the case broke, but the bright side is that my phone was COMPLETELY IN TACT. Can't go wrong with OtterBox",Very_Good
"I am thrilled I purchased this iPhone from this seller. The phone package itself, is wrapped in plastic wrap just the same as if it were purchased from the dealer. Included is the ear buds and charger. I had it checked to be sure it was unlocked,and I am happy to report that it is. I love everything about the phone itself. Works great even when multi-tasking,which is all I do all day. I have already downloaded many apps to use and nothing is slowing it down. This was a great purchase!! If you are in the market for a phone,and especially an iPhone,this is the one to purchase. I highly recommend it to everyone. Very easy to use and it is in perfect condition. Exactly as described by the seller. I am extremely satisfied. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DAJS4LE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28",Very_Good

"This is my first windows phone.Before buying this phone I did some research in the net and I found quite better reviews about samsung focus amongst most windows phones. But I was little confused because I was a huge fan of HTC phones. After couple of days I finally went for Samsung focus.After using this phone, now I can say I made the right decision because I am loving it.Go for focus...........",Very_Good
"Great phone at a good price. As far as smartphones go, this does everything I need. It was easy for sprint to turn on, no problems.",Very_Good
"I had to purchase a second phone since the first phone didn't come unlocked. This was an awesome purchase. It was factory direct, in great condition, packaged well, and with accessories. Great buy! This vendor got it right.",Very_Good
"I upgraded to this Galaxy S5 from my Galaxy S4. It is a definite improvement from the larger, clearer display to the water resistant housing, to the features. Excellent product!",Very_Good
"After 2 months I decided it was exactly what I was looking for... Well for a cheap price. My phone of three years was ready to rest for a while so I decided to look into this product because I'm a lover of photography, (but extremely poor) but this camera is incredible. Much better than the iPhone 6 and 6+! It has a long lasting battery. I listen to music up to 9 hours of my day on Google Play music and even after I get home around 6 it still has 20+ percentage left! Very happy with this phone.",Very_Good
This phone has better reception than any cell phone I've had. Very rugged. Has survived many drops onto concrete floors with no problems. Moved simm chip from my old phone to this one and that's all there was to it.,Very_Good
The phone has been great except for the battery life. Buy an extra to keep on hand when you're out and about.,Very_Good
For now is working excellent. I'm a Windows phone fan and this is a super phone.,Very_Good

GREAT!!!! CANT COMPLAIN AT ALL NO ISSUES...I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE...THANKS FOR THE PHONE IT WAS VERY USEFUL THANKS.,Very_Good
Fast and reliable! It arrived four days before the expected delivery date. Its my second day of using the device and it worked well. Im highly satisfied. I like the this device.,Very_Good
I have had an otter box case for my old phone and it kept my phone perfectly protected. There was no problem at all. Still looked brand new. When I got my new phone it was a given that I would get an otter box for it. It is the best protection out there.,Very_Good
Quad-Core really makes a difference. It's very fast and responsive. The 8 meg camera is crystal clear. I'm on the AT&T $50 unlimited plan ( $45 with on-line auto-pay). I did ask a few customer user questions about the phone. They helped a lot. The phone is great. It compares comparable to the Samsung in price and performance. It's well worth a try.,Very_Good
"I would definitely recommend buying. I was hesitant at first because im not crazy about refurbished phones but i have no complaints and im really satisfied. Love the G3. It was way ahead of its time, & still puts other phones to shame.",Very_Good

This is the greatest phone ever...I don't need a smart phone...I have an Octane which is the closest thing to a smart phone without being one...I have a laptop at home and I don't need to carry a computer with me.

"Have had this Moto G Plus 64GB phone for a few weeks and I have to say I just love it. Was not able to set it up with Verizon SIM Starter Kit (was told by Verizon customer service that I need a special kind of SIM) but I was able to set up the phone through T-Mobile and transfer my phone number from Virgin Mobile.Have not added many apps yet, but have tried Skype and my parents said that our image looks very crisp and clear.Super-quick battery charging and I rarely have to charge it during the day (but I don't use the phone much at work).Will update after I've had the phone a while longer.",Very_Good
"Awesome phone. Spyware/malware comes pre-loaded though. If you don't mind having to root your phone and going into developer mode, than this is a great phone, especially for the price. This phone competes well with Zen-Phone II, one plus one, and all other unlocked phones. This phone is sweet. Everybody will be asking where you got it, with that bright yellow. Also, 4g does not work with t-mobile in the United States. I heard the 4g works with the AT&T.",Very_Good
"We had to send the iPhone back due to it not being compatible with the plan that my daughter had chosen, and the company was great, understanding and very helpful. I would recommend this company for sure!",Very_Good

"This phone seems pretty excellent for the money. Only had it 2 days, and set it up with Tracfone (who are clueless and it was a nightmare) but now that that is done it seems great. It could die in a week, but so far, so great!Update: had a problem with an SD card, but it seems the card itself was the problem. This phone does the job. Its not an iPhone, but it also hasn't got the pricetag. It does what I need and is reliable. Wifi works well. Great value.",Very_Good
i gave it shot and i think it s totally worth it ...pretty fast on apps.I dont play games but I use it heavily with data service.Battery is not that good but it s a $200 phone so shut up and use it,Very_Good

"Its a great phone really. The edge is a lot better than the regular S6. Phone is pretty strong, battery life is great. Disappointed in the lack of expandable memory but with the various sizes its cool. Its a great phone if you're an android fan. I found the edge scene to be a bit useless, especially having to turn the phone down to get the light feature for customised contacts. I basically used it like a regular S6 however, it felt a little better in my hands with the edges. I recommend getting a simple case, nothing thats bulky..MY device however started slowing down after some time (approx. 3-4weeks) and my memory was more or less empty still, so be mindful of that also",Very_Good
"Really, there aren't any downsides. Big responsive touchscreen, plenty of memory, plenty of storage, and connection speed has been wonderful everywhere except for my house. Since I live in what is essentially a cellular black hole, that was to be expected.",Very_Good
Like phone its nice for price sometimes it get a little to hot only thing I didn't like is that it went to factory mode for a day didn't work bit other then that phone was great for price,Very_Good
de extrema calidad excelente cuidado nuevo y con todos los accesorios la verda recomiendo los productos de ellos son buenos,Very_Good

"Good phone, excellent built, battery life is really good. I am very please with the accessories and phone appearance protectiveness, the price is fair, its not a computer phone, more like a java-high-end edge phone.(-' v ')Runs what-sap, Facebook, NAS and file explorer, videos (excellent quality!), music, internet radio, office files, multiple e-mail accounts, touch screen responds well, can connect USB memory and transfer or run and play files, can open compress file like you would open a normal file (no lag), nice key bored, focus for business not for gaming, compact, feels and looks awesome.(-' - ')It doesn't seem to support; Skype, tends to crash 1 out of 6 times on NAS or heavy websites, doesn't play youtube, speakers are not to loud on the outside (fair), it doesn't give you a notification sounds on IMs apps(Facebook or what sap), feels just a bit heavy, not much app support anymore.",Very_Good
I have looked everywhere trying to find an adapter to make it possible for me to use my fusion styler. I was very happy to run across this product. I have two of them. Thank you for making it possible to use my product. I highly recommend this product.,Very_Good
I love love love this phablet. I use the Straight Talk through Wal-mart for 45 a month. Don't spend 600$ or more..this phone does it all! I have told all my friends about it and a few have gotten them :) Highly recommended!!!!,Very_Good
I got the phone for my daughter. She loves it. I have used it a few times if I can get it away from her. I like the large screen and fonts for texting. I do not have to use readers!!,Very_Good
I bought this phone for two reasons:1. It's a well-functioning phone (I like Nokias) with a touchscreen and my sister has one so I could play around with it before buying.2. It's unlocked and doesn't cost an arm and a leg like many other unlocked phones do.I've had it for just over a month now and so far so good! I really like it!,Very_Good
Love the performance of this phone and quite useful. Though it will not be a issue later some carriers don't have it setup so it can be used. Otherwise love the phone and is already been a lifesaver on a few oversea's trips already.,Very_Good
Like new! The only thing that I think should have been included was the wall charger. Difficult to charge without one!,Very_Good
"This was a gift for my dad who can't get over his old phone breaking. He's not much of a tech person so I was psyched when I found the same phone here, since Verizon no longer has them for sale. The price was great and the phone looks flawless. Dad was really happy to have his old phone back.",Very_Good

Bought for my wife she loves it. We both have one and the price and quality for the price is great. The shipping was fast and the packaging impressive.,Very_Good
"Finally I got my new device and I can tell that it was all that I was expecting. I bought it from Amazon.com store (not another seller) and when the box arrived the first thing that I checked was the model number and it is RCM72UW, which works with 3G bands 850/1900/2100, so this is AT&T, Rogers, Telus model...not T-Mobile model, so this is good news for me 'cause I use Movistar-Venezuela service. Well, to be honest I can not assure that Amazon.com will always be sending this particular model because they don't make any difference about the 3G compatibility and believe me 'cause I expend a lot of mails to customers service and they couldn't give me this detailed info.",Very_Good
"I bought this due to I always travelling to Asia. And I do not need to switch my sim card and I just put my Malaysia and Vietnam sim card then I can use in both country. But the only thing you need to be aware is when you are in one country, make sure when you make a call, you are selecting the correct sim card to make it, otherwise you may use the Vietnam Sim in Malaysia and make the call in Malaysia. You will be killed by roaming charge.",Very_Good
"Product arrived on time and looks as good as new, my daughter loves it and I couldn't be happier with the purchase",Very_Good
"Received phone today, already have same phone but it met a slight accident. Transferred all data with a quick app and updated the phone to the 8.1 and back to normal.",Very_Good
I bought a used iPad 3 off amazon. It did not have a SIM card. This SIM card allowed me to activate it to get prepaid cellular plans. The setup went smoothly other than it took a little more pressure than I was expecting to get the sim button to open the sim slot on the iPad.,Very_Good
"A good recommendation for the people, if you have a shorted budget but want a phone with a good performance, great camera and one of the latest software (including LTE), Samsung branded, this is your pick. I bought it for my mom she didn't want a huge screen phone so this is what i pick. I can say i'm not regret of buying this great phone.",Very_Good
Everything perfect. Porduct and delivered. Take note that this cellpphones just might work well wit a digitel carrier in Venezuela,Very_Good

"First off this is a great phone. The model number is US991 it is factory unlocked to work on all carriers.Camera is great. Removable battery, micro sd card slot.",Very_Good
"I just wanted a phone that will call and/or text people and the Nokia 6010 fulfilled my needs and wants! I'm glad it's unlocked because I am an AT&T user and the cell phone was made for T-Mobile, lol. I laugh all the time because I remember when these types of cell phones (that didn't have a colored screen) were the ""it"" phones back in my days, lol.If you used to have or use a cell phone with a keyboard or whatever, it'll take some time for you to get used to but it's really no big deal. Because I went from the iPhone to Nokia 6010, yep... it's a big change for me. :)",Very_Good
The phone is fantastic for who ever need to use more then one phone carrier and be connected. I got few of this model.,Very_Good

"I received the zenfone 2 and the case today Jun 21, 2015. Nice phone. The phone working fast, the camara is ok, the screen is beautiful in color and quality. The only issue if about the MMS, with the phone in connected to WIFI, MMS dose not work, it work if your data are from your cell phone company. I used Tetra app from Google Play and set up to send sms and MMS and fixed the problem. Now the phone can send MMS if WIFI is on. I and using T Mobile USA, LTE Network.",Very_Good

Loved this phone. The battery last forever. I used it for my back up sim cards. However this is not a smartphone.,Very_Good
"Purchased the watch for my 17 year old daughter. Even though it's refurbished, it looks brand new right out of the box. Some of the savings are in the packaging. The watch comes in a plain long white box, not the upscale Apple packaging with hard plastic case. If the original packaging is important to you for whatever reason, this isn't the watch for you. The watch band itself appeared to be brand new. They also include the long ans short option band. The face of the watch also looked new. No scratches or signs of wear were evident. Overall we were very satisfied with the purchase and plan to buy another Apple Watch from this seller.",Very_Good
"This Phone is Lite, Fast, crystal clear screen and voice. Plus easy to use. I have vision and hearing loss. This Phone is great for people like me when set up to Easy mode. Battery life is outstanding, add wireless charging, no cables to mess with, just pick it up and talk! YES! I Am Blown away to say the least! Lastly my iPhone friends have all fallen in Love with it. Added a clear case from Amazon real Wow factor. Buy this Phone!",Very_Good

"The Blu cellular is so difficult to open to place battery and SIM that I'm not even going to waist my time returning it since I'm leaving in two weeks to South AmÌ©rica that I Will look for someone to Buy it from me, this is the second time that I buy a BLU cellular and both times have been negative about it, they should find another system in order to remove the back plate, not even with a screw driver can you remove it, there are no even instructions on how to do it, shame on the company who makes them.",Very_Good

Everybody asks me why I don't have an I phone. BECAUSE I LOVE THIS PHONE...,Very_Good
Phone was EXACTLY as described. Color matched. Description of wear was accurate. I will certainly look to this buyer again for used iPhones.,Very_Good
I am very happy with this purchase. Everything went smoothly and it was delivered in quick time. The phone is a dream. It fits neatly in my pouch or pocket and the slide keyboard is inspired..,Very_Good
"you get a lot for your money here. why waste money on phones that lock u on contract, increase ur plan rates or just cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars? oh yeah because u fall for that marketing.seriously.. phones out now vs phones from 2 years ago have minimal improvements.i only upgrade when there is actually a semi breakthrough in technology.. this isnt the case here, but the zenfone does offer a great piece of hardware for the money. there is no lag and hardly any difference vs high end phones that cost 2x's and 3x's the money.one thing though is this thing is power hungry.. i wish it didnt use up so much battery. you'll be lucky if u get through a day of use.it does come with a lot of bloatware, but i'm glad asus included a start up manager so u can block all that bloatware from even launching.",Very_Good
"better than Iphone4s. I dont have iphone5 /6 , so dont know if it s better or not. camera is very good qulity. it is definitely worth it",Very_Good
"I've had a Zenfone 2 for over a year now and it's been great. Does nearly everything my wife's Samsung Galaxy S5 can do at less than 1/3 of the cost. I'm not saying it's as good as the Samsung, but if you're not using the fanciest features, why bother paying for them.",Very_Good
This is a wonderful phone. good battery life. still can compete with many of the newer phones,Very_Good
"works well, packaged properly, arrived on time and is a great buy. Pricing was very competitive and i would recommend this item.",Very_Good
"I like the weight is light and work properly, and still working excellent. This product is helpful like I said works great",Very_Good
iPhone 6 KILLER. Perfect size for one hand operation. Its got all the latest specs but doesn't sacrifice on ram. I wish the internal HD was a little bigger like 32gb. But it has MicroSD. Android Lollipop promises to bring back SD write functions again so 16gb is usable.,Very_Good
Beautiful case for my IPhone 6s Plus phone. Protects and also makes my phone look very attractive all at the same time.,Very_Good
i would tell anybody who wants a phone to go for this phone. its the true definition of awesomeness and sleekness.,Very_Good
"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!",Very_Good
"I was so excited to find my husband this flip phone. It works almost exactly like his original one. This one is a newer version, so he had a learning curve, but now he loves it. You just can't beat a Rugby phone when you work construction and can't afford to keep replacing smartphones !",Very_Good
This phone has exceeded expectations. A truly great phone at a even better price. I'm very satisfied. I would recommend to anyone,Very_Good
"Excellent phone,good quality. I bought this for my daughter (her first phone) she loves it! And the price! Affordable!",Very_Good

Arrived in excellent condition as listed. Just note this phone requires a nano-SIM card; the regular one is too big.,Very_Good
Lg phones needs upgrading however the phone works and meets my expectations buying from online.,Very_Good
This is a fantastic unlocked rugged GSM all world phone! Phone is Not for Stroking.. just phone and txt and camera and considerable battery life (more than a week for me) optional field exchangeable battery(pop out and pop backup battery in). .Excellent speaker with very effective noise canceling circuit.. Get the optional click in belt mounted holster..,Very_Good
"Hardware is very good and im enjoying the windows operating system :DThe odd restart by itself a couple of times, but otherwise its fine.",Very_Good
it is a very good phone system and the product is one of the top ten worldwide,Very_Good
"I just love this phone, and I'm very hard to please, even for this range of price. You can download many applications for free, my favorites are pdf acrobat reader and angry birds (Angry birds Rio is a little bit heavy for the processor, but works).I was a little worried because I've never had a touch phone, but this one blows my mind, Its sensitivity is great.GPS is amazing and the people in my cell company told me this one was the best phone for browsing the web (I belive them 'cause I didn't bought it from them). By the way the delivery was just great, I'm a recurrent costumer from Amazon and they never have let me down.The only thing that I don't like is that some times the phone tells me the micro SD card has been uninstalled (obviusly when not), I has happend about 3 times in 3 weeks. I hope is just dirt or something.",Very_Good
The best android experience.. Pure from Google one of the best Nexus phones following the late Galaxy Nexus. No phone can beat these features with that price but the One Plus One...if you can buy one :D,Very_Good
"it's been a looog wait before. when i got it it's fantastic feeling. nice key board (touch), screen is responsive.it has a hot spot. so use it as modem & access internet on tablet, laptop etcsolid built quality, & easily surpass i phone 4 in all aspects just for 200$.it's unlocked & use can use it anywhere. it takes microsim card.",Very_Good
"I love this watch!! It connected without issue to my iPhone 6s. For the price, you can't go wrong. It's also pretty durable and the battery lasts almost 3 days without having to charge it.",Very_Good
"Excellent phone if you want a budget phone in 2016!!! Yep its older than the Oneplus 3 and Oneplus 3T but I wanted a cheaper phone that is also good. Besides I like that the headphone jack is on the top of the phone instead of the bottom. I wanted a Google Pixel but I passed it up for this phone. This Oneplus 2 phone offers a similar experience to the Google Pixel due to its stock android OS it has equpped. Even though its slighly skinned with the Oxygen OS that has a few modifications ,it still feels like the stock version of android. Overall awesome phone. Fast, smooth, no lagging at all. The main flaw of this phone is that its camera is mediocre at best",Very_Good
"This is a personal phone to accompany the Samsung S5 work phone. EXCELLENT value (after 3 full days), most of the Samsung features are here (lower screen, cant read 64Gb card). Seems responsive. Dual unlocked SIMS is areal PLUS.",Very_Good
"Awesome phone. Had been using iPhone since they came out, but very happy with the switch over. Beautiful OLED screen with really cool curved edges. Love it",Very_Good
"Just got the phone yesterday and set it up and I have been playing around with it today. I have nothing bad to say about this phone so far. In fact I am blown away by it so far. Big beautiful screen, fast responsive, removable battery and storage, Lime green case looks really cool, it comes with a case, screen protector, head phones and charger (was not expecting all that from a ""budget phone"", and the list goes on. I had the note 3 before and so far I like this phone just as much if not more. I know the note has more ram and a better processor but I really can't tell a difference. The 4G is plenty fast and I even get signal in a building at work that I could not get with most phone I have gone through.",Very_Good
"I'm writing this review from my Nexus 5x. I come from a Nexus 5. Because I loved stock Android, the performance, the updates policies and the design. Google and Lg partnership is simply awesome. The Nexus 5x hadn't disappoin me at all. It only makes me love the Nexuses even more. Specially the camera. It is a whole new level of awesomeness. Combine the camera with proshot and snapspeed and you got breathtaking pictures that impress all my friends and family. The fingerprint sensoer is very fast to recognize my fingers and it is very smooth just like I remember my former Nexus 5 but with a larger battery and fast charging? Its simply perfect. I'm in love with it.",Very_Good
"I've had it for three days. The phone is simply spectacular. I live in Venezuela and it works perfectly well with Movistar. Consider buying also an adapter, the one that comes in the box is not of good quality.",Very_Good
"2nd one of these I have bought. I had a Galaxy S6 before this which was expensive and I lost it! Decided on this because it was far cheaper than the S series. The reality is that although the price is significantly different, the performance between this and the S series is not much different. It does all the things you need. The DUOS (Dual Sim) function is also super handy as a big traveler. Go for it.",Very_Good
"I'm not going to write 10 paragraphs, but this phone is great. Its super easy to use, fun, super fast and I love that it has internet sharing. I use it for my smart tv.",Very_Good
Thanks this was worth it . Will be ordering from you guys in the future,Very_Good
The only problems is: The I-phone doesn't continue to remind you that you missed a telephone call. The ring tone could be elevated. It is too soft.,Very_Good
"I ordered this phone on Dec 29th and received it on Friday, Jan.2nd. The phone was suppose to arrive between the 6th of Jan. to the 21st of Jan. The service was great. When I opend the box the phone looked brand new, no scratches on screen or the back of phone. The phone works great, no problems with it. I love the 4G on my phone, it is very fast compared to my Motorola Droid X2. Exactly how the seller described the phone is exactly how I received the phone. I love my phone and I like the front facing camera something I did not have on my other phone. I had no problems with getting phone activated. I would definitely purchase from this seller again and would recommend other people as well. Thank you again for a great phone.",Very_Good
"Met all of my expectations in performance,reliability, and no glitches so far. Will never go back to android after purchasing the iPhone.",Very_Good
"We wanted a simple, reasonably priced phone that was easy to text on, this phone does all that and at a great price.",Very_Good
Bought factory refurbished and it's just like a brand new phone! Couldn't be happier with it.,Very_Good
"This phone has lots of fan reviews posted here now, so I won't add to the noise, except to point out how well this phone works as a shareable wireless hotspot. (You will need an unlimited data plan.) Just install Joikuspot, create a Joikuspot account, and you're off. You can put this little phone back to back (held together with a rubber band) with an iPod Touch, and have much of the functionality of an iPhone, but without throwing AT&T a dime.Icing on the cake: Skype, Google Voice, and Gizmo5 all run perfectly on my E71.",Very_Good
Great smart phone with a lot nice apps and long life baterry :-) Simply love my new Samsung galaxy mini :-),Very_Good
Got it really quick! Ugh wish I would have known about the Sims card!!! But I honestly love it!! It's almost in perfect conditions accept 2 small dents in the back of the phone.,Very_Good
"Very sturdy phone. Camera is amazing. Speakers are also good. Display is truly bright and colourful. The shortcuts available when you swipe down the screen, is now enough. Emails fail to download when i dont connect to WiFi or data for few hours but only download that arrive after I reconnect. I was using LetV1S before. The charging was faster. Overall good phone",Very_Good
This is a replacement product for me and I love the expandable text board. That allows the screen to be larger.,Very_Good
"I love, love my new phone, and getting it in gold made it even better...",Very_Good
I recently received two of these cell phones from Amazon and I must say I am quite impressed. They came unlocked and their appearance and quality is amazing. Right out of the box the batteries were fully charged and ready to go. It took a few hours to read and apply the manual with backup from U-Tube videos. After I familiarized myself with the phone I inserted our smart cards and we were on the internet and texting. I got this phone to compliment a no contract family plan from the carrier Pure Talk. With the $15 plan the phones have been crystal clear and the texting is quite easy. No need for the smart phone. This fits the bill for us older adults who use the phone for necessities. Great job Nokia!!!!!,Very_Good
"I'm very happy with the Lumia 830!Beautiful color, perfect size and lightness, great design, super speedy!Love Windows Phone, very exited to upgrade it to Windows 10 Mobile... but I will wait for the public release!!",Very_Good
"I had one of these and it died, so rather than re-learn a new phone the simplest answer was to buy another one. For $103 it was a great deal and works perfectly!",Very_Good
Very nice phone it isn't as fast as i thought but still very fast. My omly complsint is that sometimes it freezes a lot with certain apps,Very_Good
i am 25 years old from greece...i just got nokia e71... this is not my first smartphone .. i a very happy with it... has great applications. wifi works perfectly in greek networks so dont hesitate to buy it if you live outside US. the only disapointment was that amazon doesnt ship to greece. keyboard little small for those who have big hands.. overall great quallity authentic...,Very_Good

"Love my phone, was never big on the idea of a smartphone but this phone is awesome n dependable for everything",Very_Good
"I've been using this for a month and this power supply works very well for my needs. It's very light and compact - about the size of my iPhone 6 Plus. It fits nicely in my messenger bag. I've had no problems with it since I purchased it, although you do need a plug - at least I did. I received the powerstation and a charging cable, but no plug. You can find a plug easily and they're pretty inexpensive. I have one from Alcatel Mobile that works well. Or better yet, use the plug from your own phone.It has provided enough juice for 2 full charges to my iPhone 6 Plus. I would say it takes about 8 hours to fully recharge the powerstation.Overall very pleased with my purchase.Mophie Powerstation XL (12,000 mAh) External Battery - Black (Certified Refurbished)",Very_Good
"My Wife used to own the LG Vu phone by signing up for the 2 year contract with one of the wireless services .. and she lost it recently.From that day I have searched a lot for buying one for her and finally ended up buying this product ... as though there are not much reviews to really base on, I liked it very much in the first look.I gave her a surprise by the time she is up from her bed with a working sim card in it... she looked it for a minute and finally said 'WOW'. And thats all I wanted when I am searching for the phone.Not just that .. it has lot of cool features and as usual the NOKIA's best battery life ... color combinations.. sound clarity while speaking and while listening to songs or videos.Finally it worked out to be one of the cool gifts that I presented my wife!Cheers- Vik",Very_Good

"The phone worked with my carrier (AT&T) no problem. It's a beautiful screen, with just a few small, barely noticeable scratches on the back, which isn't that big of a deal because I will be getting a case for my phone soon. Overall I am pleased. If you are worried about getting a refurbished phone, don't be!",Very_Good
Very good product very good transaction order arrived on time.Phone carrier took a while getting sim card to me so lCould be sure product worked. All is well.,Very_Good
Hey i Love this phone. The image quality on this is excellent. It can do almost anything. Even works with almost every software i put on it. The audio quality is also exceptional. Only problem is that it does not support most video format. But i wouldn't trade it for an N95 even though that has WiFi,Very_Good
Received it. Like it. All as described by a seller. I am very glad I got this particular iPhone.,Very_Good

"I am very satisfied with the phone, it is exactly what I needed. The shipping service delivered my phone ahead of schedule. Great phone!",Very_Good
"Buy only if you want to tinker with it. I bought this to hone in on my HTC repair abilities and to be quite honest, not the easiest phone to repair but by far one of the easiest HTC's. After I fixed the hardware, the software community including roms/bootloaders is HUUUUUGE for the rezound. Haven't seen one this big before and I even had a Nexus 4 o.O Currently I am running Omnirom on mine and couldn't be happier. It gives me the build quality and look of an HTC with the freedom of a Nexus device.***DISCLAIMER*** Battery life sucks no matter what you do. If you need great battery life either buy the OEM extended battery or get a car charger, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED haha",Very_Good

"I love this phone, especially given the modest cost. It performs well on Freedompop and does not slow down at all as I keep adding applications. Excellent button recognition, even with large fingers.",Very_Good
"So far the phone is performing as it should, great battery life and really good performance as expected. The only thing that I really didn't like was the fact that the wire of headphones was a little bit bent, almost damaged and it looks used but they work as they should so no biggie about it.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone more than a month ago and I am very happy.The battery is very reliable. I only charged it three or for times since I got it.The lock is on the side which is another smart option, because it cannot get activated in my purse by accident.The way the buttons react is a bit different, but once you get used to its rhythm, it is fine.I like the fact that only the active buttons are lit and the fact that if you received a missed call it gives you a sort of a soft bing until you see it, so there is no way you really miss your missed calls :)It has Tetris game, which is great!The earpieces are very comfortable for the ears and you can use them with your laptop, too.Finally!The phone calls are of good quality, too. A really nice phone!",Very_Good

I previously owned this phone and I was so excited to receive it again. I love all the features especially the option of having a call reject list,Very_Good
Very pleasantly surprised. Definitely a factory refurb. Looked and pigs like new w/full documentation and registration from Samsung. When serial number ckd w/Verizon had never been activated. Only disappointment was it was listed on Amazon as new but when put in cart came up as previously owned. I ckd w/amazon before buying a day it was technically a refurb. Regardless a solute you new condition.,Very_Good
So got the phone yesterday and so far I love it. I had a Samsung galaxy S5 and wanted something comparable in an unlocked phone and so far the Asus ZenFone 2 has delivered.I would say for the novice user this phone may be difficult at first as there are some settings I had to research to get it to work on my new prepaid carrier. But once you get everything up and running it works like a champ.I got the 4GB RAM and 16 GB storage version because I had a 64 GB micro SD card. So with the DS card I have plenty of storage.Also I know some reviews knocked the swap of the back and programs button but so far it really hasn't been an issue for me.I'd say if your looking for a good affordable unlocked phone then this is a great option.,Very_Good
"Great for all my needs, lives up to my expectations. I am very happy with this product. Highly recommend you buy this.",Very_Good

"My wife, who is prone to falling, loves this and wears it on a lanyard wear ever she goes. You can use it as a simple phone or (and better) you can add the emergency service which is very complete and highly detailed for about $15.00 a month. Very nice customer service people. My wife feels safer and I feel safer knowing she can summon help when I'm not there (the phone's GPS will pinpoint her location if she can't).",Very_Good
"this is a great phone for those of you that are str8 on data plans, dnt need to be on the internet to the point u need access to it 24/7, and want a slick phone with touch screen. Ive read some bad reviews but this phone was great on my end. ordered it used and immediately ordered a brand new one upon recieving it so i can give the used one to my mother as she liked it as well. quick txt with the fast slide out qwerty, and very responsive touchscreen. the only negative i feel is its not micro usb, buti can get passed that easily. some may feel its quite bulky as well but not me,i like it, it feel like it will survive a couple of drops due to its size. hasnt dropped calls and through 14 hours of use lost 1 stick of battery out of 4(checking out features throughout the day, txting, taking several pics wiff my dog, but not str8 talk time). to sum it all up, great phone if youre not all hellbent on having the latest technology or needing internet all day everyday",Very_Good

"I had an iPhone before the Galaxy S II Skyrocket, and the Skyrocket blows the iPhone out of the water. Love this phone.",Very_Good
"I love how durable the case looks right out of the box. It itself looks great as a black and yellow color. It smells new so I am going to assume that it is. I couldn't find any blemishes on the outside so that's great. It kind of feels a bit bulky though. I guess that's the sacrifice for great protection. Taking off the rubber outing of the case along with separating the middle to put my phone in did take a while though. For the money spent, the product performs very well. Overall a great product to buy and I highly recommend,",Very_Good
The phone is cool. I'm coming from blackberry 9700 background; I am now able to do more tasks with my phone without receiving messages of 'insufficient memory' to run the program. It's simply a great phone with good functions.,Very_Good

I absolutely think this is almost just as good as the galaxy s7...only big reason for me is the s7has 1 more gig of ram... My only complaint so far is that it goes on and off with reading my sim card but that could also be my carrier... I have metro PS with an unlimited 4glte plan which only makes this phone even more amazing because I can us as much LTE as I want... It's amazingly fast loads instantly and no glitches so far... Still trying to get used to 5.1lollipop so far but for $200...stop looking it not gonna find a better phone even if you have $400 to spend,Very_Good

"I bought this for my brother to use in Finland. So far it works very well just as expected. The phone arrives with European charger but the seller I bought it from added U.S. adapter to the package as well.

great replacement phone for my daughter. put in old sim card and it fired right up,Very_Good

"I received RM-1113 from FGS trading, which even covers more lte bands, that just att and tmobile in USA. It is international version dual sim and unlocked, buyers should contact sellers to determine exactly which model are selling, because some of the item description is not right. There is big difference in att, tmobile, and international version of the same model. Att and TMobile lock out some of the lte bands, so their version of the phone doesn't not work on European lte bands, most of the Europe lte bands are 3 and 20. RM-1113 also has lte band 12, which is new TMobile band that provide better coverage.Other than that it is great phone for the price.",Very_Good
"Had the phone for several weeks now and I am very pleased! Huge crystal clear display and swype rocks. Sadly the first phone I received had issues with the home button randomly and continually clicking. Returned to amazon and got working phone in two days, easy. Watching movies and youtube are clearer than my monitor and the phone multitasks well. Touch screen is spot on. Call quality is good. Overall a great phone, I would say on par if not superior to iphone.",Very_Good

"In order to avoid scams, you must buy any electronic equipment NEW. This fact even hold true to the IPhone. It was expensive yes, but I got the product that I wanted. It came shrink wrapped in new condition and like the seller promised it was unlocked. As for the phone itself I bought it in order to replace the one that I had which was blacklisted and therefore could not be unlocked. Being that the phone I had prior was the same phone it is awesome and works brilliantly.",Very_Good

"Quality - excellent. Gorila glass on both sides. Beautiful and intuitive interface. Full HD Super Amoled ! All sensors are working properly ... compass, gyroscope and others (missing the pressure sensor). So thin that it is unusual to raise from plane surfaces. )) Camera: very great shots. With reasonable battery exploitation must withstand up to night, if not to burden it with unnecessary processes (you need to take in mind that the phone is very thin, understood that the thickness of - at the expense of the battery capacity). Delivery in 2 days. I am satisfied.",Very_Good
"I absolutely love this phone. I don't do much more than calling and texting, so if you don't use too much data, then this phone is great for you. Though I don't use it for much more than it's phone capabilities, plenty of apps work with it, and surfing the web and listening to music are very easy. Simple games like solitaire are great, but games like Angry Birds are best played on something with a bigger screen, though.The most impressive thing for me is the battery life of this phone. I have an iPod touch and am frequently in WiFi zones, so I use that for web surfing and apps most of the time. Because of this, and also because of the phone's efficiency, one single charge lasts for days on the Galaxy Y. I recently checked my battery life, and on one charge I had gone over 6 days (with regular use) and still had 19% of the battery remaining.If you want a smartphone but cash is tight or you are a phone minimalist such as myself, I highly recommend this phone for you.",Very_Good
"It is really a great phone ,with great looks and performance. i have recommended it to my friends and they have bought it too.",Very_Good

"I didn't want to spend a ton to buy my girlfriend a new phone and she was gonna have to pay like a $600 deductible which is moronic. This thing works about as fast as my Galaxy S3, the picture quality isn't as good as some of the high end phones, but if you are going from a flip phone or a year or 2 old smartphone, this thing is WAY better than most of the phones out there at a MUCH lower price, I am 1000000000000000% pleased, you will be too, trust me. It worked with her TMOBILE service, just switched the sim cards and put in her google account info and everything synced up fine.......phone is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Very_Good

"This is the first LG phone I have ever purchased and I am very impressed. The battery life is amazing, it outlasts my Samsung Note 4, Samsung S7 and S5 phones by hours. The phone is slim, light and easy to use although I do suggest a case since a friend had her child over and he dropped the phone cracking the screen. The camera is good, not great in low light but most cell phone cameras are not very good without lots of light. Processor and memory are good, 32GB of RAM is more than enough for most people plus it has an expansion slot.I will buy another LG phone after having such a good experience with this one. If you work outdoors or are very active this is not the most durable phone, it's delicate so either buy a good case or a different phone if you are hard on them!",Very_Good
Solid and functional. It is what I have come to expect from otterbox. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a case.,Very_Good

im not a big phone geek but this phone is sooo user friendly and easey to use!! i have always gone with samsung phones because of there pressure sensitive screens instead of the usual heat sensitive screens. i do love pressure sensitive screens because there easey to use with my nails. the captivate is NOT pressure sensitive but the sreen is so huge that texting is not a problem for me! It also has the cool talk to text feature on the android keyboard witch means i dont have to type at all!!!! this phone is sooo fun i havent put it down!!!! love it buy this phone!!!,Very_Good

"BEST PHONE I`VE EVER OWNED!The Moto X was a great flagship smartphone in it`s launch date back in 2014, the price at that time was OK, but now with this price cut value is really amazing.

This is my first Android phone; I purchased this to replace my Windows phone. I think this is the first smartphone I have used that really worth the buy. The screen is bright and vivid. High Internet speed on my T-Mobile 3G and Comcast Wi-Fi at home. Nothing would discourage me from recommending this phone to others. The rear camera is very high-resolution and takes beautiful photos. I have had the phone for a few weeks and I still discover new features and settings almost every day.,Very_Good

"If you want or need small...this is it! Just like its grown ups, it is a full functional phone. The only real draw back to it it the inability to use the stock keyboard for any practical purposes, but after install a ""big button keyboard"" app and turning the phone sideways, that is even manageable.",Very_Good
"Bought this phone to replace my wife's phone which is several years old and needed replacing. The phone came boxed with the charger, cord, headphones and instructions. There were English instructions that were well written and easy to follow. It took us about 30 minutes to set up the phone for here and move everything thing over. It has working flawlessly since we got it and she is very pleased with it. It is not going to compete with some of very high end phones but it does have a quad core processor and plenty of speed for what she does. For the price, this is one of the nicest phones that I have seen",Very_Good

My computer is having trouble recognizing the device, :(other than that, I love this phone!",Very_Good
"My husband loves this phone so much as much as I do (different color) and he has figured out more than I have, he loves the quality of the camera, as it has a selfie (front camera) and photo booth style, also has beauty fix which makes ypur skin look better and pretty much fixes you if you'd like.Also it has the option to hide apps if you don't use them is good to have. Speaker is in front which makes it easier to hear when you turn on the speaker which has helped me to talk while driving.I like it is a thin phone and decent screen size for our taste. Just love it.",Very_Good

"Very happy with this purchase. I was in the market for a new phone but wasn't interested in spending $600+ on a 6"" 4K display mini tablet which seems to be the new rage these days for some reason. I just need a decent compact phone small enough to carry around (5"" screen or lower), has a 720p display, 16GB RAM, decent battery life, and a relatively current Android (5 or 6) supported. It was between the Blu Vivo Air LTE, Motorola Moto G, and this phone. The Vivo Air didn't have a SIM card slot, the Moto G came close, but had slightly lower specs so I went with the P8 lite. The only thing I feel this is really missing is a removable battery, but then again, no other phones in this price range seem to have that either.",Very_Good
"When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed. I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours.",Very_Good

"After reading the reviews I was skeptical but wanted to move from Apple to BlackBerry. I received the phone on time and brand new. The box looked a tad scuffed but the phone is perfect and works amazingly with Verizon. Not many people understand wanting a BlackBerry but if you are a die hard BlackBerry lover and want the Q10, this seller and product is perfect!Would buy from them again, and naturally will always love BB.",Very_Good
"It works on Tmobile USA prepaid network. My previous phone is a blackberry and this is my first android. A great platform with lots of customization possible. Love the quart-core processor. Browsing on the web is seamless. Love the alarm functions, calender, organizer, apps and lots more. The phone is large and does not fit all pockets my clothes. I use it for almost everything but call. If you talk a lot on the phone this may be too large for smaller hands (gets uncomfortable if you have to grip it for too long one handed). May not be a phone for everyone but sure is great for me so far.",Very_Good
It is great to receive a phone that was affordable its so easy to use screen is easy to see,Very_Good
"This is one of the best purchases I've made.I wanted a large screen (4.3 ""),thin(just over 1/4"") and easy to use.I got all of these things in a GSM phone that I was able to use with the SIM card from Consumer Cellular. It connected flawlessly right out of the box. I'm one of those old guys (85) so you know it had to be easy. I had to ask my youngest son for help to set up a Google A/C but that's it. I know there are a lot more things I'll be able to do in the future and I'll probably be trying many of them. I am so pleased with this phone that I got a white one for my wife.For the price I think they're great.",Very_Good
"Works as expected so far no problems, just hoping it continues. Arrived earlier then expected. Looks good. Easy transaction all the way around.",Very_Good
Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy,Very_Good
I love the crap out of this phone. For the price point it's EVERYTHING you could desire.Tons of positives.Only 1 negative though.Speaker kind of sucks.Be ready to replace the speaker. It's super easy and cheap to do. 5$ or less.,Very_Good
"Purchased this phone for my hubby. He has used this phone for as long as it has been out. This was a replacement after he ran over his other phone with his loader. Good phone, but I don't suggest you run over it with a 5 ton piece of equipment, the loader won!",Very_Good
"I really enjoy this phone. It does pretty much everything I want,movies an games are excellent. Ya kinda feel sorry for others when ya pull it out an then look at their puny phone",Very_Good

"First of all... Excuse my poor english...When palm presented this phone... I need :-P one. I love technology. I love palm.But they do not sell in Italy.When hp buy all the project I hope they make a great job with the WebOS... (include that they spend some money for buy...).But I wrong...Damn!... At very low price I buy this wonderful (but dead) phone to take a look!I am very happy to buy! So, now, I hate HP! :-)",Very_Good
"We are still learning to use all the functions of the phone. Very satisfied with the phones performance, but the operator's performance needs help.Very satisfied with the purchase and would definitely recommend this phone.",Very_Good
"You cannot beat the quality of this phone for the price. While it doesn't have a lot of internal storage, it's otherwise a quality device. And you can add an SD card, so the smaller amount of storage isn't really a hindrance.",Very_Good
Great for the price; second one I've purchased for a son who needs only basic functions.,Very_Good
Works as if it was brand new. Packaging was great. I bought it for my aunt who had a Galaxy S3 prior to receiving this phone. She can't get over how much faster the S4 is. She's very happy and I have peace of mind knowing her cell phone is always on her and that it works well.,Very_Good
this phone is just great i had the iphone for a month and dreaded it i dont understand why everyone wants an iphone. anyways this fone is great for email its great with navi and the texting is ok but its somthing ull get over..... internet is fast for a phone... has all the apps u really want to use overall GREAT PHONE HAVENT CHARGED IT IN 2 DAYS!,Very_Good
This is great and somewhat powerful phone to bring value to us the consumers. iPhone is really a luxury phone and Samsung phones is a more professional business use.If anyone wanted to pick up a phablet but didn't want to pay about $600 this is a great phone to buy. $199.99 recommended retail price but on sale for the holidays at $139.99.Games would not run 100% super high quality so don't expect a lot for a budget smartphone. Photos also take some clear shots and HDR is effective. This phone would be a success on sales by its hardware and design,Very_Good
Exactly what I expected! I had no need for the belt clip so was thrilled to find this Otterbox without one automatically included.,Very_Good
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!",Very_Good
"Great phone to use, very resourceful in all the apps available to download for convienence of everyday, professional,entertainment,etc I would recommend this phone. Only con I have about this phone is I wish I could've got it in black instead of white.",Very_Good
"I absolutely love this phone. Its not too big, not too small. It fits the person who likes a neat Android instead of the refridgerator type sized phones. It was clean and nice. I also got this as a gift for my fiance' and I know he will absolutely love it. He hasnt seen it yet but I have tested it out and I am absolutely jealous that I didnt get one for myself now that Ive gotten one for him. He doesnt like complicated devices and this was pretty straight forward and easy to use. It was unlocked like I asked for it to be. Very user friendly and I just prefer white phones over black phones so I got it in white. I am happy I did because it looks soo sleek and clean. my baby is a spoiled guy but for his good deeds, he deserves this as a present. Smiles :) It is really a nice phone. what can I say? Overall, I absolutely love it!",Very_Good
"This phone is simply amazing. The A9 processor is on point, multitasking is a major key, live wallpaper and 3D Touch is amazing. I'm glad that I bought the phone off amazon and it's backed by their guarantee if you purchase it from their warehouse.",Very_Good
"Esta dentro de mis exigencias, excelente equipo, la cÌÁmara es sensacional, tremendo procesador, muy rÌÁpido, capacidad de almacenamiento aceptable, solo una sugerencia que para accesar a la baterÌ_a practicamente hay que desarmar.",Very_Good
Great phone. I had a little trouble getting it connected to my mobile carrier (Metro PCs) because I didn't realize it was a duo sim card but I have been loving the phone. It's fairly large but it holds battery very well and the Android operating system is fantastic. A good choice if you want a smart phone but can't afford the latest Samsung model.,Very_Good
"The phone was everything and more, not to mention the customer service which made the experience even better.",Very_Good
Amazing phone and it definitely did fulfil its years as it was battered by my child and of course by the wife!,Very_Good
Good phone if your new to android especially if your not sure if to get android of apple iOS but if you want games like a new gen smartphone this is not for you,Very_Good
"This case was great quality as shown and I loved the fact that it had a place for my ID. An easy way to not have to carry a huge wallet all the time!HOWEVER be warned, this case does not protect the front of your phone at all, as the sides are completely flat and stop at the sides of your phone.",Very_Good
The phone is everything that I expected it would be and it's easy to use for even the inexperienced cell phone user.,Very_Good
Fit my daughters iPhone SE perfect. Love the colors too..wish I could find one for my galaxy,Very_Good

me gusto mucho el telefono blackberry 9320 con camara de 3.2 mega pilsel y con flash en 3g recibi conforme.,Very_Good
"Great first phone for me. I love the quartz color, which is a very creamy clean white. The battery runs out pretty quickly because of how much time I spend screen on, but it also charges back up pretty quickly. In addition, know that the charger is a USBC, which is very uncommon and not to be confused with USB, which is what most chargers are. I love love love the system, the size, the camera, and the fingerprint sensor on the back.",Very_Good
"I am in love with this phone for the price between 200 _ 300 $ I find this to be the best, g3 is to big for hands, it has amazing battery life, the double click feature is awasome.. Would love it more if it had a better front camera than 2.1MP.. have two g2 and one g3 in my family.. My second one was not working properly on the double tap. Closing was fine butit wasnt opening.. Checked online easy solution in the hidden menu option..love it..",Very_Good
I bought it unlocked to use on T-Mobile for $30 a month. Can't beat it. The phone is plenty fast with the expandable memory and removable battery features. It came with gingerbread and shortly after I updated to ICS. Can't wait for Sammy to put Jelly bean on it.,Very_Good
"Until today the phone has worked very well. It was adapted to the phone line I installed it, it is international and works perfectly. It's fast, convenient, simple and good image resolution.",Very_Good
"It's a great pay as you go phone, with decent connect, great price and as a college student not crazy contract I have to worry about if I'm late a payment.",Very_Good
"I haven't tried to use it under the water, but all the other features work great !Great Deal !",Very_Good
"Excellent phone, low cost and good performance, buy a gift and liked it, comes with Android 4.2.2, the camera is good for beginners and basic users is enough. Thank you.",Very_Good
Looks and works great. Brand new out of the box just like I ordered. Thanks,Very_Good
"Great quality phone. When I purchased I was worried because several reviews cited problems with seals broken and possible inauthentic phones. The S6 I received was in perfect condition and def brand new. Purchased from seller theCoos with prime shipping, ordered in Black on the 18th got it on the 20th. So far it works as expected.",Very_Good
"Amazing phone for the price. Great specs for price and comes with screen protector, case, headphones with it. Great speaker volumes. Overall, great buy..",Very_Good
Very happy with this phone. Quick and responsive with a great rear camera. Clear loud speakers and so far has run everthing I've put on it without a stutter. Camera takes great pictures and has useful basic features. Phone audio is clear. Fingerprint unlock feature works smoothly and is convenient although placement on the back of the phone is a little high for me to easily reach. The phone itself feels solid and is thin enough to slip easily in and out of pocket. In my opinion a very nice powerful phone for the money.,Very_Good
"I bought two of these phones. They are too good for such a low price. I've had several phones but this is only next to my iPhone 5. The two people I gave them to have requested for 2 more. In this case I have ordered for 3 so as to give away one myself.Please do not increase the price; I shall buy more.Moses Musaazi, Kampala, Uganda.",Very_Good
Although it says unlocked is not completely. I had to pay a little bit in order to be able to use it in Latin America but it worked great! no complains,Very_Good
"When this product was listed as used, I got a little worried. It looks feels and for all intensive purposes is a brand new iPhone. If it was used they sure fooled me. Great deal.",Very_Good

Fast and reliable. Shipped quickly and the product was exactly as described by seller. works great and is in perfect condition. I have had no problems with the cell phone and my sim card slipped right in and worked! Highly recommend for someone looking for a great smartphone.,Very_Good
"I bought this used from A-Z tech, and when it first came it looked pretty good. Just a little bit of barely noticeable dents on the bottom and that's it. Then when I first used it, the battery seemed to have been the trouble. Within 20 minutes or so of not using it at all, it would go from 100% to 1% or dead. And I know, now you're probably asking why I gave this five stars...I gave this product 5 stars because I had the chance to send it back to A-Z tech to get it fixed and came back pretty quickly like in a week. The iphone worked perfectly and the battery problem was gone. I am so happy with this iPhone right now and I really, really recommend buying phone products from A-Z tech, it's free returns, and the used products feel like they're almost new.",Very_Good
I love this charger.This is a solidly constructed charger that gave me confidence that it would work as advertised. I am using it at work and have had no problems with it. I have it plugged into a battery backup unit under my desk and have 2 cables plugged into it. One cable is used to charge my cell phone and the other is for various other rechargeable items. I have not had a problem with any of the devices I have charged using this wall charger and the charging times seem consistant with stand alone units.Bought this charger because my other charger took forever to charge my devices. I love this charger. It charges two devices at once and quickly. Great price. Great product.,Very_Good
The phone was delivered quickly. We have experienced no problems and are very happy with the purchase.,Very_Good

"I bought this phone refurbished from Cellular Gallery inc., it arrived right on time, looked like new one, and professionally packaged. I asked them to return the phone later because I had no need of it, the costumer service were professional enough, I got it returned and was refunded ~$30 -they said it was because the seal was open science I used the phone once to ensure it was working-.The phone itself looked pretty good. Totally recommend the phone and the seller",Very_Good
Bought this Atrix to replace the first one that my husband ran over. He is really pleased with it and would not purchase any other brand or style.,Very_Good

"got scared a little when it came all in chinese language, had to look at another android device to refresh my memory where do you change language :) And then mobile data wasnt working right away, but looks like you just need to ""download internet and mms settings"" form ""settings - wireless and networks - ...more"". And after that T-mobile date works at full speed, with LTE and everything.I saw comments that the phone is heating alot, that is not really true, i had Z1 and Z3 before, it is not getting any hotter than the previous ones. Of course if you leave it in the sun, in a summer day in Las Vegas, it will get hot, but since it is waterproof in that case i just put it under running water, or go swimming with it at a pool to cool it down :) very convenient and effective.",Very_Good
This is a pretty good phone and the price I have is wonderful. The screen is even better than iphone.,Very_Good
"So far I love eveything about my galaxy s 3. Its very sleek, fast, and very user friendly! Highly recommend.",Very_Good

Phone is great.

Great product/I was nervous about buying a refurbished phone-everything worked perfectly!!Saved me the hassle and tons if money that Verizon wanted. Very satisfied :),Very_Good
"My third Passport since release. The keyboard is amazing, word suggestion is very accurate from the three choices, perfect for reading on screen, fb is available if you don't change initial installation OS and set the phone to not auto update to any newer OS and fb will be native, second rate but native. HUB is perfection and powerful. Do a search for 'Cobalt Landing Page Crackberry' if your handy to download and install 3-5 Android APKS including the real Google Play Store, plus a means to fix Android Apps the require Google Services.This is still a very viable option for a cell phone! I recommend the Ringke Leather Case as long as you apply a screen protector and don't actually use the credit card slots as the addition of cards will make it too thick and may scuff the phone's screen.",Very_Good
Nice it looks like a 007 James bond movie pretty cool watch everybody likes My watch 5 Stars a Winn,Very_Good
The product has exceeded my expectations. I've seen so many bad reviews about Sony's devices and this one in particular as well that I was afraid of purchasing this expensive device. I'm just loving that it has a lot of features other Android devices are far from having. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy SIII rooted with a lot of extra features that did not come with Samsung's Android.The only thing I really miss from my older device is the root feature I used to use a lot. I just don't root this one because of warranty issues and DRM keys issues. But don't think that most users will ever need that. Sony has made this with already awesome features.,Very_Good
Couldn't of asked for a better phone for my child. I didn't want to sign up for another 2 years with our carrier so what a good way to go.,Very_Good
I wish you well for selling me this watch. I didn't have to spend $400.00 and it is absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!,Very_Good
Best case I've used thus far. Dropped a few times and has held up like a champ. The fit feels nice and solid. Color is nice. Feels smooth but grippy on the hands for a secure feel.,Very_Good
Just received phone few hours ago but was very impressed that the phone was exactly as stated in sell information. Set up went smoothly and Moto X 2nd gen.is a great step up from Moto G. I couldn't be happier with purchase. Great valve.,Very_Good

"This phone was purchased for my teenage daughter, who loves it. It's rather small but very good for what she does constantly which is texting and facebook activity. Samsung is a reliable product.

Had to confirm it to be in English but then my voicemail messages were shown in a none gish language in the notifications... I think I fixed it by going to settings and switching the device language back and forth... and restarting between changes... I think there is an let function missing. This device is from Pakistan o.O ............ it's beautiful and battery is alright... but if you need a lot from your phone your battery goes down 1% every few minutes? Not so bad? It works fine with tmobile but you need to set your apn settings and search for your network...I use the pen a lot. I almost lost it though so...,Very_Good
What I really love on this Posh optima L530 android phone is the front facing camera13mega pixel which I usewhen taking selfie photos. Thanks I appreciate your quick service. Received this phone in working condition.,Very_Good
"I purchased this phone for Cricket Wireless and it has been a awesome phone. I had to retire my Galaxy S4 because Cricket Wireless switched over to GSM phones.

"I am finally in right there with all the other upgrades. I so needed this...!!! The phone is GREAT, it looks GREAT, it performs fantastically and I am very well pleased.. I suspected that this phone would turn out to be one of the better of my past purchases. However, IT'S REALLY THE BEST ! And it looks, feels and handles like NEW! What a difference. It's a really nice feeling to know that you've spent your money wisely. This purchase is truly an investment. Every one in a while, we all should ""treat"" ourselves to something nice. I GOT MINE!",Very_Good
"Everything about this phone is perfect.the look,the performance,the camera and the durability. I literally crashed this phone several times and surprisingly nothing happened. Glad to own this first Nokia device!",Very_Good
"This phone rocks. I've had 2 separate phones (this same model) over the past 8 years. One was dropped in a can of primer (paint) and sunk to the bottom, and still continued to work for years after. Great for people who tend to abuse their phone.",Very_Good
"I upgraded from the HD 6.0, not complains, works perfectly, display is amazing and it works with all GSM companies in USA and MX. This is undervalued product should cost 500 dlls minimum. I installed SD card with 64gb I have to spend more than 120Gbs in videos, photos, music and everything I need.Highly recommended.",Very_Good
I was very pleased w/the phone. It works very well. I have it all up and running. Thank youfor such great service.,Very_Good
"The X1, is a great phone. However, compared to other phones now a days it tends to lag a bit. That could be because I flashed a new rom to it which uses higher cpu frequencies, or because I am always running android instead of the intended WinMo 6.1. Aside from minor speed issues, the phone works quite well and the panel system is pretty neat.",Very_Good
"Excellent advanced android phone for a very manageable price, especially if you need to travel and have a carrier-locked phone. Very happy with it, it's a bit on the heavy side, but it feels very solid.",Very_Good
"Excellent Watch at that price! Perfectly fits my wrist, good design.Connect to Iphone 6s smoothly to sync calls, very surprised for the clear sound quality. Need more time to check more functions.Spend a little more time to connect to Samsung Galaxy, this watch has much more functions for Android OS phones but needs to download their APK file and install, it costs more time but made me surprised it can control my Samsung Galaxy's camera.Not tested each function but this watch is really great at that price. 5 star!",Very_Good
Phone was excellent however needed to send back needed a t mobile instead of a AT &T. Delevery and sevice of this phone to us was great,Very_Good
"This was my first blackberry and I am glad i made the switch to go ahead with a blackberry. The Curve 8530 is one of the top blackberry phone line out there. These phones are great for handling Business like emails, surfing the web with lightspeed, texting and messenging. The Blackberry 8530 is definitely a worthy opponent to the iphones. The keyboard did seem to appear small but you get used to the keyboard fast. I love blackberry phones. Get yourself a blackberry my friend!",Very_Good
"I purchased the Blackberry 9810 as a gift for a friend in the Islands, she loves the phone, she raves as to how great it works with no issues. Great item and excelent delevery time by the vendor. I would use them again.. Thank you...",Very_Good
Great phone. No problems with the phone. In great condition.It was nice doing business with you. Well worth what I paid,Very_Good
"Great phone. Screen resolution isn't nearly as bad as people are saying just because it's not up to party with the galaxy series or iPhone. The display US still very clear and colors are good. For what this phone is and the price you're paying it goes above and beyond expectations. Smooth operating, great battery life, runs all modern apps perfectly.The only complaint I could say is that if you're looking for a nice crisp camera this is not the phone for you. Works fine just isn't for the photographer type.",Very_Good
"I've seen reviews of people having issues with this phone, but after a month I can say I'm happy with it. The touch screen can be a bit odd at times and the brightness adjusts differently than I'm used to.. Still a nice phone. I use straight talk (AT&T tower) and get good reception. No one believes me when I tell them how much I paid for it.",Very_Good
Fit perfectly! Love how the clip can also be used as a stand for my little guy to watch his shows! OtterBox is the best!,Very_Good
"It's metal. It's pink. It's a phone. I have been searching for a pink phone for years. I refused to own a phone for years unless it came in unashamed PINK. No ""champagne"" or some s***. Nope. It is PINK. It can be whatever pink you want it to be. A light pink, a dusty pink, a bright pink. But most importantly, it is truly pink. Hopefully future models stay pink on the front, sides, and back.Besides the pink, the phone is great. It calls. It takes photos. It goes on the internet. Google's Android is super awesome. I recommend changing the keyboard from the standard HTC to Google's (you can download it for free on the play store), so you can freely use all of your favorite non mom-approved language without hitting an infuriating filter.",Very_Good
"Really appreciate this product, usually I'm a fan of Sony phones, this phone is best of all...... recommended of this product....I have thin phone cover for that phone, my phone was fallen so many times, but it is not broken yet, only thing is you have to put case & front glass protection.",Very_Good

"I saw many review in YouTube about this cellphone and I decided to buy in amazon because I want an unlocked cellphone so I can use of any carrier. The cellphone came a day before estimated date, and open the package with AT&T box. I tied to find the pin to open the SIM card slot but it was not there, and I used the needle to open, and I switched it on and works really good. And I didn't find the headset too, I sent email to seller and they were really good customer serVice, and they sent all the things I need. Thanks amazon, I recommend this seller. Thanks.",Very_Good
"it is a very good phone. is not the more expensive one, but for the price your are buying a very very good product.",Very_Good
"It's an Otterbox - it is great protection for my iPhone. Had the bulletproof ""super-Otter"" - but it was just too bulky, and I did not really need THAT much protection. This case will allow me to drop the phone and it will survive. Always pleased with Otterboxes.",Very_Good
I ordered this phone because mine just died after so much use and now I have an IPhone and hate it and as soon as my contract uis up I will go back to this phone,Very_Good

VERIZON WIRELESS CELL PHONE MOTOROLA BARRAGE V860 the perfect work phone for my line of work i should have went with the camera version but still a great phone....thanks great deal,Very_Good
"I made the switch to Android (specifically a Note 3) and, although I love the features, in couldn't get used to touch keypad.This phone is phone has made me fall in love with BB again. It's perfect for work, the lack of a track pad took some getting used to, but now it's a breeze.Awesome purchase for the price. I also bought a Q10 for my brother and the Q5 actually seems faster. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good solid work phone with the added fun features of Android.Also, it came fully unlocked and without any carrier markings as promised.",Very_Good
I bought this phone as a backup for my other phone just like it except for the color. I was deteremined not to get another 2 yr contract with AT&T. When my phone started to power off by itself I decided to find another one just like it. For some strange reason my old phone has not stopped working so I haven't had to use this one yet. I'm sure it will be great just like my original phone. It's plain and simple but works beautifully. The keyboard is small but I text just fine with it.,Very_Good
"best phone I have had in years, so glad I purchased this phone, easy to operate and just the right size.Nothing like a motorola phone, I like them the best.",Very_Good
WOW I feel like I got the. Best deal ever phone is & works perfectly no issues at all,Very_Good
Amazing. I had several phones all of which had some problems out of the box. Amazon was amazing. I was amazed by the size the clarity and easy set up. The thinness of the phone is a super plus. And it has lots of features.,Very_Good
"Good product, good look, runs well, Vendor should however let you know the sim card slots are one regular and one micro. Otherwise met all expectations, Customer support was excellent.",Very_Good
So far so good I have not gotten any trouble with the phone. Will check back in six months for a true review.,Very_Good
"Works perfectly, absolutely no problems with product or seller. I would recommend this phone to anyone, phone is small and sleek but you should also purchase a case for it",Very_Good
I purchased this card because I lost mine in Jordan. I ordered this and I received it quickly. I don't use Verizon here but when I go back to the states I need to have it. I received this quickly and would order from this company again.,Very_Good
"I love this phone!! The camera takes exceptional photos and video. The speakers are as good as can be expected from a phone...the notifications are quite loud. Not sure if it's the fastest phone out there, but it's the fastest one I've ever had. I use T-Mobile, and the data connection works perfectly at 4g speeds. The device has dual sim card slots, and both are mini size. I had to get a new one to fit.The 5"" screen is very crisp. I tried a 5.5"" device before this one, but it was just too big for constant use on the go.the only drawback to this phone, and probably most off brand dual SIM unlocked phones, is that it's nearly impossible to find a good case for the phone.overall this is a fantastic phone, especially for the price.",Very_Good
I've used it for about 2 hours works great really thin. I get compliments on how thin it is. Worth the money,Very_Good
"Had this for a couple of weeks and it's GREAT. Got a sim card for Straight Talk,and was off running. Was using a Overdrive Pro‰ã¢ 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot,because I'm on the go so much. This works just as good,if not BETTER!!! With Straight Talk's $45 plan it is a GREAT combo!!! The ONLY reason I am NOT giving it a 5 star review is BATTERY LIFE. When mobile data is used it DRAINS the battery. Also have NOT found a good case for is yet. It is VERY similar to a RAZR M,but NOT the same. Size wise it is ,but head set,and charging opening is DIFFERENT.UPDATE!!!! I LOVE this phone so much I just bought a NEW one. My last one I abused SO much I finally cracked the front,It took over a year to do that.STILL works perfect. From drops on concrete, and just overall work in ALL weather,WITHOUT a case on it,I'm surprised it works at all. The coating is scratched on corners,NO dents a VERY ROBUST phone.",Very_Good
"please note the description of this phone, it clearly states the phone is unlocked, well the phone I received was LOCKED. I lost a week of service from straight talk because the phone did not work(like an unlocked phone should) this is/was so frustrating! How do you make this right?",Very_Good
"This product certainly looks and feels like my original Rugby ""1"" which is in A-1 condition, since my purchase in 2005! It is a heavy duty, military-grade instrument that has served me well. My need for the purchase was due to the fact that my ""old"" Rugby will become obsolete at the end of this year. This phone serves all of my needs. I need no device for entertainment; I LIVE my life.",Very_Good
"Super fast, light, and powerful. Has some of the best features and the octo core works amazingly with kit kat",Very_Good
I received the Apple iPhone on time and the phone arrived as it was described. There were no visible scratches or anything. Dan was very helpful when it came to answering questions about the phone. Thanks!,Very_Good
The phone is good and it allows me to watch movies it takes out clear pictures,Very_Good
"More than I expected! I am in love with the rare topaz blue color of the phone. Not many people were aware of the variation of colors that could be found online. The space on the device is very impressive as well. I am used to getting phones that have only 8 or 16 GB but I have more than half of the space remaining on my phone and I have numerous apps, pictures, and music downloaded that I use. This phone is an unlocked phone and I was able to successfully add it to my existing Straight Talk service to replace an older phone that was broken. The service on the phone is great. The picture quality is better than the older Galaxy S5 that I previously had. There is a very crisp picture and video. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in this phone and the quality of it.",Very_Good
samsung got a winer phone here good work samsung i love it it rocks like google rocks it like a computer,Very_Good
"The phone was, as advertized, in excellent condition, like a new phone. This was a very good deal. Thank God!",Very_Good
I love this phone. I got it for my son and he loves it as well. Runs on 4G perfectly and I am using it with Simple mobile.,Very_Good
"Out friggin standing.. For the price there is no comparison. This device is fast, very responsive and the fit and finish is very well done at least the black version is anyways. 64gb Samsung SD card was recognized without issue.I have had several flagship devices such as GN3, GN2, GS4, GN, and this phone goes toe to toe with most of them.4G LTE on T-Mobile works as expected.",Very_Good
"Yes it did meet my expectations very much,... Bought for a friend and he is thinking of ordering another one. :) I",Very_Good
My son broke his original iPhone 4. He cracked the screen. I refuse to buy a new one and buy into another contract. It was much cheaper to find him a used phone from here and this one was in awesome shape. Even came in a box!,Very_Good
"Bought from The Wireless Hub.Shipped very fast and arrived on time.Great picture quality, great sound. Get some decent headphones, as always the ones bundled are mediocre.",Very_Good
"We have never had an LG brand phone, but this phone is pretty good. My dad, who isn't very good with technology, likes it a lot and uses it with ease. He figured out how to text and send pic messages without my help. I recommend this phone!",Very_Good
"This product is nicely equipped with more than enough features, but for my sole opinion the price should be a little more lower to beat all other competitive.",Very_Good
"This is a great phone. I got it as a gift for my husband, and he is totally enjoying all it's apps and such. Sturdy.",Very_Good
"Very good! The only thing is that the only case you can get is the clear gel case. They don't make any other cases! But it has very good pictures, only that the camera is a bit laggy, but very minimally. The headphones have an incredible sound quality, too! I like the fact that it has internal flash, too. The only thing is that the screen protector makes the colors a TINY bit more matte, but who cares? The battery lasts very long, and I did not expect it to come with a plug adapter for Europe, but it did! This phone is a very good choice! It costs about $80 less on Amazon, as it costs $200 on http://www.poshmobile.com/Buy this phone!",Very_Good
"I did an excellent purchase about, a great phone and the best and faster shipping!Im from Venezuela and it works perfectly with 3G network, just teel to H&P that provides a 1,2 and 6 bands for Movistar cause bands 1, 4 and 8 just works with Digitel",Very_Good
Excellent condition. No scratches or damage. Added to my AT&T account with no issues. Very pleased. Recommended.,Very_Good
"Great phone. Living and working overseas, one has two choices a really expensive phone or a poor quality phone, sometimes both. This phone works great and serves me well.",Very_Good
"I am more than satisfied with Samsungs products, Note 4 was gift to my son, he is more than happy to have Samsung Note 4.Excellent quality !!!",Very_Good
Everything works really well. It matched the description. I received it well before expected shipping time. It was very reasonably‰ÛÜ priced.,Very_Good
Good phone seems to be working good so far. Works good with a digicel sim card,Very_Good
OtterBox Defender Case. Some people don't like it's bulkiness but that is what I like with the good grip it has. Thin phones always feel like they are going to slip out of my hand.,Very_Good
Got it quick and it was in very good shape. Good price and fully functional. Thanks.,Very_Good
"Best phone I have had so far, great performance I am very pleased with this purchase. Also great battery life , battery seems to charge very quickly when using the correct charger about 30 min on average from 35% level. I have ran multiple emulators and am quite impressed with the performance. Dropped this phone once and can not see any damage what so ever so the build quality seems to be great. Only a small complaint , I ordered the silver model but the actual phone is two tones white on the front and silver on the back. Looks like an I phone from the front view. I also purchased the BLU VIVO XL and am really happy with this phone as well.",Very_Good
Love the Galaxy 4. Had previous one and cracked screen plus needed new battery. It was easier to buy this one and I have been using it for a couple of months with no problems.,Very_Good
"Arrived quickly. Easy to install on iPhone 5S. Only thing that worried me was the packaging said it was for an iPhone 5, but it DID fit the iPhone 5S with no problem.",Very_Good

"Excellent phone. This one if for ordinary people, ones who don't care about all the blitz of a smart phone, and that is me........",Very_Good
Very good product. Worked perfectly with straight talk sim card. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a cheap Iphone.,Very_Good
"Great phone so far after one week, really quite amazing for the price. We have been searching for phones that will switch over to wifi smoothly for talking AND texting, which seems simple but it has not been all that easy. We live outside of any cell phone service area, so this feature is essential. This one works great. We popped in our existing t-mobile sim card (family plan) and it activated without having to talk to anyone at T-mobile. Battery life is a bit short--you won't be able to go for days but it hasn't been a problem.Only other glitch is that the phone will occasionally buzz non-stop if Skype is on and you get a text or something.",Very_Good
"Excelent Phone, good functions, it worked as soon as it came to my country, I wont doubt in buying another one in the next oportunnity.",Very_Good
"Going from the S3 to the S7 was quite a leap! Multi-window feature is great. Screen size is perfect for me, image sharp & clear. The phone is slim and elegant. Just love it.",Very_Good
This is a very nice phone! Came with Marshmallow pre-installed. I switched over from a Samsung Galaxy S 5 and I still have my removable battery and SD card. The camera's better and it hums along with no lag. I don't miss the S 5 at all. I'm glad I made the switch. It has a 1 year warranty and came from Beach Camera. Order was on time as usual and packed well.,Very_Good
"This was great outstanding phone. Other people talk bad stuff about this but they are all old reviews. I just bought this for my aunt like 1 week ago and it is amazing it even comes with the europe style plug you need for europe. It came much earlier and everything was great and brand new sealed in package.When I opened it it was all in german but some of it was in english so I could go to the settings easily and change it it wasn't a big problem. It comes with a usb and charger, headphones and more. This was just amazing I would buy it again.",Very_Good
"The phone is great! The perfect combination of size and power, and includes a great camera!",Very_Good
I'm absolutely loving this phone!! Because I don't have to be connected to a WiFi source my phone is much faster. Its also very light and smooth. I can't tell you how many times my friends have asked me if its the iPhone 6+ lol. I've also recommended this phone to my older sister because she has an HTC phone and she also loves this phone as well. I just wish Verykool offered upgrades for the newer and bigger Verykool phones that are to come or that are already out,Very_Good
"I'm very happy with my Moto G Plus. I debated on whether or not to update to the Plus model and am so I happy I did. The fingerprint sensor is wonderful and quick! The phone is very responsive. I was concerned about the larger size, but has not been an issue at all. I was going from IOS to Android and have not had any regrets. Very happy with my Moto phone!",Very_Good
"i just got the cell so i can only say all good so far. but regarding the condition, it was excelent. the cell itself looked compleatly new. i noticed a few dinks after having the cell a few hours but they are not noticable at all unless you are really looking for them. I was worried about buying a used cell phone, but im convenced now that it is the best way to buy them. I will easly buy from the same vender again. for $125, im very happy with my new (used) Rezound1 year later: ok so rooting this cell is not a walk in the park. but well worth it for the cheap wifi 4glte tether. this cell is plagued with the inability to charge a very low battery and you will be dead in the water if you don't buy a external battery charger ($5 on here). your cell wont charge or it will just cut off and forever show a too low to boot up light flash.",Very_Good
"I used to have the European version of the phone and I really loved it. I had a problem with the camera and couldn't fix it, so I decided to get the US version because I love the compact size and the processing power that comes with it.",Very_Good
"I love my new phone so far. at first I did not, but after my daughters husband made the 4G work I love it. the picture is real clear the screen is sensitive so touch is not a dragging across screen. my Straight talk service was a snap to install and as long as you follow the directions you should find no issue. does not come with a micro sim so you will want one of those too. sound out of unit is not good but when hooked to my car stereo it is a great sound. came with a gummy type case and a screen protector.pros1. cost was great2. works seamlessly with straight talk.3. case and screen protector were nice4. easy to setup and operatecons1. it is big so do not get for a small hand2. not many accessories all in all it is a great phone and will be buying more and recommending them to everyone I see.",Very_Good
"Excellent product, the phone unlocked and New , works great in Movistar Venezuela raises 4G LTE",Very_Good
"This is the second one I have purchased. It takes a licking and keeps on ticking unless you accidently drop in water for along period of time. Even so, you can still use it, if properly dried in time. This cell has a lot of features and if used correctly , you can do anything from GPS to E-Mail.",Very_Good
"I am writing through my new iphone SE. No problems with it, it was unblocked and in its package sealed. Thanks!",Very_Good
Omg this phone has exceeded my expectations and I'm actually using it right now to write this review. Beautiful and works perfectly. Battery life is incredible. I love my new phone!!!!,Very_Good
This phone is cute and good friendly. I would give it to my mom and she is so happy. I recommend it 100%,Very_Good
"Item was perfect for my needs. Replaced my old phone that I can no longer get, thank you!",Very_Good
I have used these phones since they came out. I like that they aren't huge like most touch screen phones and I can fit it in my pocket when I need to.,Very_Good
"Great device, excellent battery supports sd card and removable battery. The back power and volume takes some getting used to, otherwise not disappointed. No LTE in US but wow HSPA is very fast I though it was LTE for a moment.",Very_Good
"This phone got ran over by a Toyota Tacoma (screen down) and all it did was leave 7 barely noticeable blue dots, in the pattern of The Big Dipper (I'm from Alaska BTW). This is a very sturdy phone. Although there were problems with the home button for a short while; a small irritation, but it was no biggie because the back and recent buttons still worked, and i don't really use the fingerprint scanner. Software has never acted up on me once even when updating from lollipop to marshmallow, with the exception of the home button, which works now. I'd usually buy Google Nexus phones, but i wanted to see if this one was worth the hype (IT IS). it's got great hardware that rivals or surpasses industry flagships in this field. 5 Stars!!",Very_Good
This phone has nothing to envy to the Samsung Galaxys and with the advantage that It can handle two simultaneous telephone lines.It would be perfect if it had kitkat available.,Very_Good
I Love this phone. Works with metro pcs & t mobile. This phone has pretty much replaced my tablet. The ear buds are great too.,Very_Good
"Awesome phone! Came ready to go, just popped in my SIM card, added my APN settings and haven't had a problem with it yet! Hard to find a decent case for it but I've had this phone for 6+ months and no scratches or problems, much more reliable than my Lumia 521 I used to use.",Very_Good
"Este cÌ©lular es sÌ¼per elegante, sus funciones son increÌ_ble y sobre todo su precio.lo Recomiendo, me sentÌ_ sÌ¼per felÌ_z cuando obtuve este producto en amazon.com",Very_Good
"I read reviews for this device before purchasing. And I was not disappointed with what I got.Solid device, good performance and as close to a native AOSP experience as you can get on a non-Nexus device.It's not a contender for the latest LG or Samsung devices, but for 1/6 of their price, this unit is a great bang for the buck.",Very_Good
I bought a BlackBerry Z30 from ShopTronics and it arrived on time and came as they said New in original box and a good price. :D,Very_Good
"Got it, first upgraded all the soft, synced with account and worked right away. Very stable (unlike a 9100 from an outside vendor I had to return)",Very_Good
"Bought it two days ago and it worked great, right out of the box. The two updates took minutes. The ASUS UI isn't that bad that I might stick with it a bit longer before switching to Google Launcher. I agree that the camera isn't the best compared to my Note 2 that I have, but I knew that before buying and it isn't all that bad, especially with all of the different modes I got to play with. I am using Cricket wireless with it and it's working great. No issues with the 4G LTE/4G data connections. It's quick, responsive, and has a nice feel to it. Only gripe I have is that removing the back cover is near impossible for me for some reason and I am afraid to continue to try to remove it for fear that I'll scratch it (although I think the people at Cricket may have scratched it already to install the sim card). All in all, it's a great phone at a great value. My husband liked it so much that I will be ordering him one too. (This review is for the 4gb ram phone)",Very_Good
Best phone for the money. Had it a week so far and with intense use this thing just keeps powering through with no lag or hiccups. I love it. Don't need to charge the battery but every two days.,Very_Good
"This is one of the best phones I've gotten for the price, and I've recommended it to a few people. There's only one disadvantage to be aware of: the antennas aren't great. I've found that in many locations in which my girlfriend's 6P has 75% signal strength, I have no signal at all. The GPS is also really slow to get a fix, and is sometimes inaccurate.That said, it's not really a problem I notice often, and for the price, this phone is really great quality and an amazing value. I get compliments on it all the time.",Very_Good
This cell phone is a great starter phone for an 11 yr old couldn't ask for anything better. And I have an iPhone but sometimes my daughters phone gets better reception then mine,Very_Good
BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT AND EXCELLENT QUALITY. THE PERFECT PHONE. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. IT ARRIVED AT TIME N ECXELENT CONDITION LIKE NEW AS EXPECTED. WORKING VERY WELL IN VENEZUELA MY COUNTRY,Very_Good
"I love this phone.I purchased this phone about 6 months ago for use on T-mobile. It has worked wonderfully, and it is the best phone that I have ever used. I chose the phone because for its camera, display, and (relatively) small size. It looks great and takes pictures well. I have read several reviews about how the AR effect is silly, and it is. That being said, my children love to play with that feature.The phone is responsive, and does not every feel sluggish. I usually get about two days of use on a charge, but it can be just a day if I am using it a lot. The voice interaction works pretty well, so long as I speak slowly and deliberately. The phone has plenty of internal storage space plus a micro SD slot. The Sony apps that are installed work well, but I primarily use the photo/video apps.In the end, I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a premium level phone that actually fits reasonably well in your hand/pocket.",Very_Good

"I am a big fan of ""generic"" phones. I hate paying the cost of name brand phone for something i can pay a fraction of the cost.My phone arrived Friday afternoon and within hours my phone, apps, messages, and data was completely configured and ready to use.This phone is solid. Great features. Fast. Quick to respond. 16GB Storage space was perfect . . . especially with my 64GB MicroSD card.The only thing I would have wanted is a flash on the face facing camera.I did add on the IVSO screen protector and the KUGI case. The screen protector was a little harder to get on than i wanted but, it did go on completely.",Very_Good
I've had my phone for several months and am really happy with it. I will buy my next phone from Amazon!,Very_Good

I really like this phone but it is a little heavy. It would be perfect for anyone that needs a rugged phone.,Very_Good
At first I was browsing for an android phone and I came across this phone. I was looking for something I can afford with my price range. I wanted a small phone and I don't really care how thin it was. So it had meant my expectation. And I cannot seem to leave it alone since I got my first android phone. :)Plus I bought a reasonable price case that protects my phone as well. :),Very_Good
"Came earlier than date expected, was sealed in box. Didn't actually expect it to be a new phone for the price.Great deal!",Very_Good
I love the phone. Does so much more than the iphone 5 love the size as well. I love the split screen feature. To me the phone is just plain awesome.,Very_Good

"very simple phone to use. I bought this phone for my mom because she is getting to the older side of the age. She needed a keypad that was easy to look at, and for phone use only...no texting etc. She likes it! Cant complain yet.",Very_Good
This is a virgin new phone it still had the plastic skin over the lenses. I started with this model of phone whenI first got cell service and have excellent service from them and I will continue to use them. I was surprised to findnew ones still for sale sense motorola quit making them. Buy them while you still can!P.S. When I got my first one from Verizon it was over $300.00 ten years ago.,Very_Good
"I owned the Q10 before this and this is a great upgrade. Battery life is better, OS 10.3 is amazing, the camera is sharper and more vibrant, voice command (and voice to text) works well, and having a physical call/hang-up button plus a trackpad only enhance the experience I had with the Q10. I did notice at times the phone can be sluggish, mainly when I'm trying to swipe; I also do miss having a replaceable battery . Overall, though, I highly recommend this phone (I should mention that if you are using T-Mobile like I am, the Wi-Fi calling will not work with the latest OS. Disappointing, but not a deal-breaker for me).",Very_Good
"I looked at numerous phone reviews on YouTube and Amazon and found this phone to out perform others with half the cost. First off, the phone arrived in two business days. Right out of the box, it set itself up, updated the software and worked perfectly. The screen is large with vibrant colors. If your an Android user, you'll be right at home. The phone feels like an iPhone 6 and works as good as a Samsung 7. The only thing that it doesn't have like the flagship phones have is a voice control, but I'm sure there's an app for that. I would highly recommend this phone for anyone who isn't a name brand snob.",Very_Good
I love this phone and Tracfone is the way to go with their sim card and airtime deals.,Very_Good
"OK. I came back to BB after using all kinds on Android devices. My last one was the Motorola Maxx HD.I think that for a business-man the BB 9790 is really the best choice. It's very solid looking and professional. Good battery, and the BB iconic keyboard. If you're looking for a child's toy, and to take pics for Instagram - you have your iPhones/Android. For real work - this device rocks! One last comments - work perfect on AT&T 3G",Very_Good
This was exactly what I was looking for. Protects the screen and edges. Clip on case converts to hold the tablet in either landscape or portrait mode. You can also choose to lay it at two different angles. One for typing and working with the tablet and the other angle is more for arcing movies.,Very_Good
"My sweetheart had one of these since 2005. Recently, the phone ceased being capable of charging its battery (even a new one). I secretly suspect that she had plugged an unauthorized charger into it, ruining the charger electronics. Her contract with Verizon was well past two years, so she was eligible for a free phone. We looked on Verizon.com and everywhere on the internet, but she could not find a phone like her pink Motorola RAZR phone. My sweetheart wanted a pink RAZR phone just like the one she had.This product filled the bill exactly. It is the spitting image of her old phone and every feature works great. It was thoroughly clean outside and all previous numbers and data had been removed inside.She loves her `new' (reconditioned) phone!My sweetheart is 76.",Very_Good

"for my first smart phone i am glad i chose this one. the only thing that i have an issue with is that the phone will- out of the blue just shut off. its an easy fix, just pop the battery out- it is an inconvenience- but an easy fix.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone for my sister as a replacement for her older 3GS that quit working. She has limited funds so newer model iPhones were not possible and past problems with used phones made that not an option. The 3GS is a dinosaur but it still has great features and is very easy for almost anyone to use. The iPhone 3GS purchased from Tablet Distributors and fulfilled by Amazon was as described, new and unlocked. It came in the original packaging with wall charger and headphones. I do not think the wall charger provided works but the old one is fine so I don't care. I upgraded to the latest iOS, restored contacts, and connected to Straight Talk without problems. Very happy with this purchase.",Very_Good
"I can't even begin to explain how happy I am that I bought an Otterbox for my phone. I always thought they were unnecessary and bulky, but now I love it. I got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 mini for Christmas and was so worried about dropping it and having the screen crack. I dropped it once without this case on it and it fell flat on the ground and I was just dreading picking it up. Nothing happened, but I didn't want to take that chance anymore. I have dropped my phone several times since purchasing this Otterbox, and my phone has not been damaged at all. The only downfall to this case is that the ""home"" button isn't covered like the Otterboxes made for iPhones, so there's always some kind of dirt or lint getting underneath the case and appearing on my screen. I don't mind taking it apart to clean it, but it's kind of annoying.",Very_Good
"The seller says the phone comes unlocked, but that's not true. It does not work with South or Middle American or Carribean carriers. Samsung Regional Lock. But I wrote them and sent me the unlock code, very good attention via e-mail. Thank you for taking responsibility even though the product descricion says nothing of regional lock samsung. Unlock my phone and it works perfectly.",Very_Good
It's ok I bought it for my son and he told me his good and he loves it,Very_Good
This is great phone for the price. The camera is ok but the pictures aren't great as the iPhone 6 but didn't expect it to be since this is an inexpensive smart phone. I did have a problem with the WiFi connection when I first received it but now it is working find. I would definetly recommend this phone to my friends.,Very_Good
"Great phone, unlocked and everything. I had a little problem with figuring out the micro sim card but I finally got it right and everything works perfectly.",Very_Good
"The best phone on the planet.Once you slip into the OS concept of swiping, nothing out there is even close to the natural feel of using the phone. Multi window swaping and the ability to install and run those (just can't find for BB apps) by loading the original PPK files makes it the most versatile phone out there.There is nothing I can think of it can't do as well as, if not better or more intuitively than, my PC regarding data retrieval and indeed input if properly set up.Screen: OLED what more to sayNetworking : PhenomenalStyling: Read the titleWondering why the Z50 isn't out, it would be a dunk slam with proper marketing.

"I'm an avid hikker and have used different sattelite phones in my many treks. From Globalstar to Iridium, I've used them all. All of them usually required a spot were the signal was good and to be very still. I have used this phone from a moving car while crossing over the Andes with very good reception. I have also used it in the middle of the desert in Peru, in a hike over the Callejon de Huaylas in Peru and in the middle of nowhere in Costa Rica. I'm very happy with this phone.",Very_Good
"So far so good. I've had phone about a month and am very happy with it. It's significantly faster than my S4. The screen is great. The battery life is great. The turbo charge is extremely fast. I haven't had any issues with the phone getting hot even in a case and playing games.I pulled my Verizon SIM out of my S4, popped it in the G4, rebooted it, and everything worked. I've had no issues with voicemail. The speaker is surprisingly loud. I really like stock Android with nn bloatware. The gestures are helpful. I use the double chop motion to turn on the flashlight more than I thought I would.I may buy wife one for Christmas.",Very_Good

"I have always had very basic phones since I am not a big fan of electronics, however, I can now see the appeal. I have had my htc mytouch 3g for a couple of days and love it. It was brand new in the original box and I believe it came with everything but the extended battery, user manual and did not have a sd card. I had to go get the sd card and paid 30.00 for a 16gb. The screen is small but as a first time user and a person who does not use the internet very often or for work this is a very good starter phone and well worth the money I paid for it or better yet not paid for in a newer model. One other thing to mention my local T-Mobile shop guys were impressed with the packaging and overall value of the phone and what I paid for it but did mention it is an older model.",Very_Good

"Best phone I've ever had and it has dual sim at 4G, what more could you ask for? I first thought that the 32gb non expandable memory would be a downside, but the OTG friendly phone let's you use an external Thumb drive to store your movies/music/photos and whatever data you would like to view via your phone.

"We bought two of these. I'm never signing a phone contract again. We broke that vicious circle by providing our own unlocked phones and going with a GSM network for service. I feel unshackled! Although the phone can be tethered...It's a beautiful piece of technology, smooth feel, large screen, fast as heck, and several features that are very handy.******I am three and a half months into using this phone and having major problems with it. Several factory resets didn't fix it. Took it to the service provider to check the sim card. Sim card is AOK. The mother board in the phone has failed. Called HTC. Big run around there. Bottom line: HTC will not honor the warranty on this phone. They said it was a used phone because I bought it from Amazon. After Ia few choice words, I hung up with them and called Amazon. Cudos to Amazon!!!! Amazon will honor the warranty.I will never buy another HTC product in my life. Those are really smarmy business tactics. Shame on HTC.",Very_Good
"I've had this phone for a couple of months now and really liked it, so i bought another one for my mom for mothers day. Its an amazing phone for what it costs and I was happy enough with mine to make a second purchase, its definitely a phone worth buying if you need a phone that's unlocked and has decent specs compared to most other android smartphones",Very_Good
Love the case. The outside rubber shell is a lighter shade of blue than it looks in the picture.,Very_Good
Working out great for me. Most phones weren't given me what I was seeking. This one delivered. Just one thing I wished Windows would do. Well maybe two things. Have more game choices and allow more music _Ù_¦ downloads apps from other companies if you already have them.,Very_Good
"the phone was in perfect condition, but i found out I don't like iphone's. But it does work perfectly.",Very_Good
"This was a surprise in the best of ways! I had bought one a few weeks ago from some where else and i was very disappointed! But with this phone i purchased from Taylor Wireless, i am 100% satisfied! I will buying from them again!",Very_Good
"I got it for my teenager son, he is happy to have it. All the functions work perfectly!",Very_Good
Much sturdier design that the previous Defender I had. The rubber areas are better connected so they don't wear out like the iPhone 4 defender case I had. Highly recommended.,Very_Good

This product is terrific and has wonderful effects and when i bought this for my sister she loved it. I love this phone.,Very_Good
"It's what I expected for price I paid. The software is minimalist what it's indeed super!! No useless apps. Very light smartphone, no overheat even when I use it for internet or playing games. It run predictible without hangs. In conclusion I'm satisfied with this smarphone.",Very_Good
"Now charges, didn't before, was able to add more storage as well. Easier to use for loading files than my Apple Ipod.",Very_Good
"I've had two of these for my son. Very well made, sturdy, and good battery life. Highly recommend.",Very_Good
"This phone is beautiful, I paid a little more to get it new in its original box but it was worth the extra money and wait. It has an smooth and easy to use keyboard and it fits like a glove in your hand. The screen resolution is crystal clear and you do not miss a detail. Many people said they had problems with their phone being locked onto a carrier, but I inserted my SIM and I am picking up AT&T flawlessly. The touch screen is responsive but you sometimes forget it is there due to the thumbpad. One of my favorite feature is that it tuns off and locks when you put it in the holster, but it turns back on and unlocks upon retrieval. The holster it comes with does not have a clip, so I recommend buying one. Overall, it is a great phone and I would buy it again.",Very_Good
"Not only lived up to expectations but exceed them, was brand new in the box, and the phone has worked incredibly.",Very_Good
"I bought the S4 not to be used as a phone, but just as an Android device. It was cheaper than an Apple iPod with better functionality. The only concern I have it that the back cover seems a bit flimsy.",Very_Good
"It is a nice phone. It comes with the earbuds, charger, cover, and instructions, so you don't have to worry about looking for any accessories. The price is good and the delivery faster than it was promised. It came in a box appropriately secured and safe.",Very_Good
"Got this for my wife. Replaced her aging iPhone. The Samsung migrate feature is really nice. All her contacts, emails, and calendars just showed up on her new device. She was able to set it up the way she wanted. Overall she really likes it.The only con that she has mentioned is the button on the front is easily pressed when its in her purse and ends up turning on.I will also note that the phone is super light and slippery. It is a little hard for me to hold.Battery life for her is great. She is by no means a power user. But if she forgets to charge it one night she can easily make it through the next day. The standby time is excellent.",Very_Good
"I've had this phone for about two months now and I absolutely love it! It's a great phone. One problem though, the brightness sometimes changes by itself even with auto-brightness turned off. Other than that, it's a great phone.",Very_Good
"Unfortunately, Verizon doesn't support the unlocked version N9005 Galaxy Note3; therefore, the only alternative was AT&T. Excellent phone, with a multitude of smart features! Indeed, the best smartphone money can buy! Patiently awaiting the 4.4 KitKat update!",Very_Good
"When Samsung removed the ability to add removable storage to their line of phones I quickly defected. A short stint was run with LG and Motorola/Lenovo and now, with the S7 Edge I'm happily back in Samsung's court.I've been using Samsung devices since before the Galaxy line and have had each device save for the badly thought out S6 and Note 5. The S7 Edge is superior to the former iterations and I am happy to say that not only is the hardware beyond average but the software has been updated to not only run smoothly but also detracts from the excessive bloatware and creates a much more pleasant overall user experience.The Edge feature, while still gimicky I feel, does have its uses but I feel that like the S-Pen on the Note line you will either use it extensively or not at all. In the end though this is a wonderful upgrade and a welcomed return to the ability of having 200GB in my phone in addition to the onboard storage option.",Very_Good
"Edit: received lollipop in july. Much better now, problem solved.It has not received Android lollipop yet. Motorola said it would get lollipop, then it never happened??? Other than that it is a decent phone. 1gb of ram kinda limits things, sometimes you will get a redraw when going to the home screen. Also Google's apps are uninstallable. Camera is OK but not great.",Very_Good
"excelente cell phone de excelente calidad, el envio llego a destino en tiempo y forma. recomiendo a este vendedor para futuras compras",Very_Good
excellent product works the best only thing negative I can say is that the article discover is not as described we acquired black and gray but I sent it deserves a 5 star for product functionality,Very_Good
"This phone is worth considering if you like the Samsung Galaxy SIII but not the size. This phone is very smooth and full featured. I won't repeat the specs as they are all over the place. I will say, the build quality is solid. Battery life is a daily charger, but it makes it through on normal use. Heavy users might need a little charge time in the middle of the day. The Touchwiz interface has improved so much since the days of the original Galaxy S phones. This phone is about the same size ans shape as the Captivate but the performance is way beyond the Captivate ever way (without upgrading the ROM from stock). JellyBean makes this phone a perfect daily driver for those who want the power but not the size. It is a great compromise in my opinion. Make sure you check the hardware spec as this phone does not have all of the same sensors as the full sized SIII. For me, the sensors it had were more than enough. Others might disagree if they need NFC.",Very_Good
"Es de lo mejor este equipo, ya lo he actualizado y va de 10, se los recomiendo 100% al igual que el vendedor",Very_Good
I love this phone.I just bought it for my daughter and she loves it. and it indeed was unlocked as promised,Very_Good
"Better then expected for the price. Battery life is very good. I did not charge mine for over a week and when I did the battery was still at 50%. I do not my day glued to the phone, but I still use it about an hour or more a day. Camera is even good, not great, but good. I am liking it more each day.",Very_Good
Works great with my Verizon contract. Replaced one of our cell phones with this and have had zero issues with it! Would definitely purchase this again and from this seller also! Thank you!,Very_Good
"Amazing size. I had the galaxy note 4 that was huge, this has the exact same software just no pen but is tiny and amazing.",Very_Good
"Item ordered was well-packed and it arrived on time. I am very happy with my Blackberry Curve 9300. I love it. I did not encounter any problems whatsoever. Contacting the site (Worldwide Distributors) was fairly easy. I did not have to talk to a machine. I just wish all sites are just like Worldwide Distributors. I have started recommending it to my friends, especially those who are tied up with 2-year contracts with their service providers and find that those data plans are not exactly what they need.On a scale of 1-10, I will give Worldwide Distributors an easy 10!!!!",Very_Good

Works perfect. Nice phone with octa core processor. But don't know why but the update to Lollipop 5.1 do not happen. I have tried through Kies and OTA but it doesn't detect any new update and still in KitKat 4.4....and Lollipop for Note 4 N910C has been releaed. I'm user from USA.Updated at 5/31/15: I'm updating to Lollipop today. 5 stars then.,Very_Good
"I am very happy with the Nokia E63. It dose the job, it has WiFi, which is great! I think that the best part was the price.The only downside is the lack of GPS.I am using this phone in Easter Europe and have no problems at all.Bet choice.",Very_Good
Highly satisfied. Nice phone. Now my son is already begging for more memory. Good thing I can add to the s5! :),Very_Good
"The phone works great. I live abroad and I had no problem to use it because it's an unlocked phone. The battery lasts for about 24 hours with the 3G connection enabled all the time. If you use it for constant browsing, the phone gets a little hot on the back.The big screen is great, the touch keyboard works amazing and the android market is much better than the one Apple has for Iphone. It is a very thin model, it is not heavy at all, and it is easy to carry.",Very_Good
"This is the first time I bought a Posh as replacement for my Blu. I was surprise how thin the Posh was, and the touch screen reacts much faster than the BLU. Then again this Posh is a octacore, for the price of a quadcore. I love the design and color (dark blue), its almost a pity to put a cover on it. Up till now I enjoy my Posh very much.",Very_Good
"Good phone for someone who does not want to spend much and need a good phone to replace an old one ,,,and for those who wonder and don't want the hassle of buying a phone that need to be unlock ,, the phone is ready for use,,,,, you will receive it unlocked .....",Very_Good
"I am still learning to use some of it's many features. It's speaker phone is very clear and concise, a caller cannot tell when I am using the speaker system to communicate with them.",Very_Good
What a breathe of fresh air. You delivered exactly what you advertised. I would recommend you to my friends and family.,Very_Good
"As long as you get the smaller sim card this phone works with T-mobile 100%. We had a iPhone 4 with the larger sim card. Just went to a T-mobile store, they gave me a new smaller sim and transferred everything to the new phone. Very easy and they didn't charge me anything!",Very_Good
"Este celular lo compre mediante un amigo le llego a la direccion de el y el me trajo a Ecuador todo estaba perfecto el telefono nuevo todo empacado inclusive me vino una tarjeta de memoria de 2gb dentro del telefono lo unico que este celular era fabricado en un pais europeo y no venia con el programa en espaÌ±ol pero no hubo problema ya que mediante las aplicaciones pude instalarle el idioma espaÌ±ol,por cierto le probe chips de las dos operadoradoras mas conocidas del pais(claro,movistar) en las dos funciono excelente sin necesidad de hacerle algo al telefono y hasta ahora no me ha dado problema todo esta bien y lorecomiendo mucho por cierto yo lo compre directo a amazon.",Very_Good

"I bought this watch for my husband, for Father's Day. He always wanted a smart watch and has been complaining about not having a watch for a while now. I seen this watch, read the reviews and decided to purchase because of the great valued price. Shipping was fast and packaging was good but with the packaging, it does look very generic. That needs to be updated. The watch is great and well made. The touchscreen is perfect. Absolutely no flaws with the product itself. It has many great features- Bluetooth, texting, calls, clocks, pedometer, sleep etc. If you're looking to buy a smart watch but don't want to pay a steep price, I do recommend this watch! Please rate my review helpful if you found it helpful. Thank you for reading my review!",Very_Good
"I would rate this at about a 10 on a scale of 10. It took me a few days before I figured out that the CLR button is the back button for the menu system. Knowing that really helps alot. The menus are well layed out and the options very clear. The buttons on the phone seem big enough and are easy to press. The phone seems solid, but light. Overall construction seems sturdy. The LCD screens are very clear. I LOVE THIS PHONE I got a refurbished when i got it looks like a new oneGot it on time Thank you Thank you",Very_Good
"Physically, the look of the phone was beyond what i was expecting. I was pleasantly surprised!!",Very_Good
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included.

I have had this phone for almost 2 months and haven' had any issues. My wife has a white one from the same seller and both are good phones. They do the job and you can't beat the price. Battery life is excellent and way better than any phone I have had in the past. If you wanted the Galaxy note but don't want to pay the price this is the phone to get. Works flawless.......A++,Very_Good
"I got this case bercause it was very low in price, but no doubt, it is an OtterBox and the protection is worth more than what I paid for it. there is no better case on the market for the iPhone. Period. This case is good looking and well built. It arrived on time and the low price made this a NO-Brainer.",Very_Good
"This phone was just what I was looking for, the battery last for days even with me using it a lot. Its perfect if you're not really into all the fancy stuff the other phones have, its perfect if you want a simple phone for a great price",Very_Good
Yes. This phone mean a lot to me. This phone is what I every wanted in a phone. This phone have a lot of program that I love... I will really need this phone back I don't want any phone but this one BLUI love this phone,Very_Good
"This is an amazing phone. I've been using it for a week now, and it's a MAJOR improvement over the S4 I used to have. The international version worked perfectly in Argentina (where I use it) only by cutting the previous simcard to the appropriate size.",Very_Good
"phone is amazing! i don't know what other adjectives to describe it! it's a cheap phone that works WONDERFULLY. even though it came out 2 years ago, this phone has specs that are better than the iPhone 6 and 6 plus! the phone is a beast. setting the phone up with tmobile was a breeze, went there, came out 10 minutes later, and 2 hours later, my phone was activated! only thing I didn't like was that im not able to get lollipop without rooting the device. if anyone knows how to get lollipop without rooting, please tell me! but other than that, the phone is spectacular and I recommend it to everyone who wants an amazing phone, without an amazing wallet!",Very_Good
I received the phone on time and it looks like new. I had my sim card and memory card. I started to use the phone immediately after charging it.,Very_Good
"Really grew to love this phone over time. My only regret was not getting the 32 or even 64gb model. It's fine though because I can use my USB OTG cable and 64gb flash drive for added music and videos. You learn to appreciate the added features that Motorola has included especially the Moto Assist. I am looking forward to the release of the Moto X+1 and will keep my 16gb X as a backup. Near vanilla version of Android Kit Kat makes this an ideal phone. I used to have gripes about the camera, but it still takes great outdoor shots and videos.",Very_Good
"I am very happy with this phone. I've had it for a month now. It works just fine, takes great pictures, was shipped promptly and packaged well. I will buy again from this seller.",Very_Good
"This is a nice phone. I had a little problem with the shipping, but it turned out fine. I really like this phone.",Very_Good
"I love this phone. It's the perfect size, great screen and camera quality, affordable. I like that it came with a clear plastic back cover and an extra screen protector. It's super fast too. Looks like it cost way more than what it did, and NOBODY can tell what it is. When I say it's a BLU, people are shocked, lol. It looks so slick :-) The battery last alot longer than expected considering all the texting, emailing and facebook that i do. I have IWireless as a carrier, and it was hassle-free to pop my SIM in and transfer all my contacts/pics. I think I even get better reception than the phone I had before from IWireless. I was able to drop the insurance from my plan, while it was only $6 bucks a month extra, but every time one of my crappy IWireless phones would break, I had a $150 deductible to replace it!! If this phone breaks, even without insurance, it will be cheaper to replace it with another one versus paying the deductible. I am super happy and sooooooo glad I chose this phone. A++++++++++ :-)",Very_Good
"The features of this phone are ridiculous, the list never ends. Use it as a bookmark! Dice some onions! Hold someone hostage! Whittle some wood! Scrape up some flooring! This phone does it all!",Very_Good

"I bought Samsung Galaxy S5 mini from Amazon.com and using with AT&T carrier in USA. I have received the phone in original samsung unopened box. The phone is BRAND NEW and I observed that the phone is not associated with any carrier. It is just from Samsung factory made for UK/UAE region. It's working very well with AT&T and I am enjoying the phone very much. It's very handy size wise and has all features what Galaxy S5 has. Seller/Amazon ships ontime and found price also reasonable. I took the phone to AT&T showroom and they just inserted the new micro SIM and it started working. I love this phone and very beautiful phone working at 4G LTE speeds, but we see H+ symbol with carrier network. AT&T said H+ speed is same as 4G LTE. I recommend this phone to anyone. Supper seller, super prompt delivery and super phone as they advertised on Amazon.com.",Very_Good

"Bought this phone because I was tired of big smart phones and the fact that you can't find one for under $700. This little thing is great! does all the things you want it to do. Great web browser. YouTube is great!. However, the HP catalog is no longer supported:-( No worries though- Just go to your favorite website that would have an app and create a folder! Same thing as an app!! Yeah it may be small- but this thing is better than ANY Android phone on the market! Ive had this for about a month now and ZERO glitches. Take that Andriod!!

I got 2 of these as I really like this model. They are back ups as I just replaced one a couple weeks ago. The slide out keyboard is the best feature for me and now I can have this model for a long time. These are for Verizon only. If you look closely you can still get new ones cheap.,Very_Good

I will write another review based on the performance. I m heading out of country and hope that the phone will work with other gsm carrier. So far I love the look of it.,Very_Good
"It's a very nice phone. I like it because it's big so I can easily read a web page using the desktop site instead of the mobile site. The phone is scheduled to get Android 7 shortly, so the phone will be completely up to date even though it is last years model. Finally, it has a removable battery. I refuse to buy a phone without one. I plan on keeping the phone for several years so if I need a new battery down the road, I can just buy one. The idea of needing the phone to be serviced by a technician to replace a batter is ridiculous. If Samsung hadn't gone with the nonremovable battery they might have saved themselves a lot of heartache.",Very_Good

"I always buy OtterBox Defense cases for my phones, and for any family members when they get a new phone. I bought this case for my grandparents to protect their new iPhone. I have used an OtterBox Defense case on all of my phones since I purchased my first iPhone (almost 6 years ago), and I have been extremely satisfied with the durability of the cases and the customer experience with the OtterBox company as a whole. I have dropped my phones on numerous occasions, and have never cracked my screens. Some people complain about them being too bulky, but I look at a smartphone as an expensive piece of equipment that I want to last and be protected. I have almost everyone in my family converted over to an OtterBox case now. If you want your phone to be protected, buy and OtterBox Defense case. You won't regret it!",Very_Good
