The phone works great and looks good. It is a bargain for the price. I recommend it for those people who don't want to pay allot for a smartphone.,Very_Good
I looked and looked for a phone that my 82 yr old Mom could easily use and this one is great! It has a dedicated and easy to locate 911 button as well as the ability to set up a specific order call list and I was able to put notes in it. It has a large screen that she can easily see and is still small enough that it is not too heavy to put in her purse.She really likes it!,Very_Good
I love this case. I like it because It makes the phone thicker and easier to hold on too.,Very_Good
"Great phone..the more I use the more I like...make sure to get a case, phone can be a bit slippery..",Very_Good
THIS IS THE BEST TABLET PHONE I EVER PURCHASED AND WATCHING ANY KIND OF MOVIES OR VIDEOS WENT BEYOND ON WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. THANKS AMAZON AND BLU BECAUSE THIS DEVICE IS A PC PHONE!! _Ù÷_,Very_Good
"Even though I wanted the regular s5 not the mini, this was a great product from what I tested.",Very_Good
"I was worried about purchasing this phone due to the other reviews I read, however it came brand new as promised. Everything works well except for the speaker phone. I don't ever really use it so its not a huge deal.",Very_Good
I was pleasingly surprise to find out this phone has the latest Androind OS.It was relatively cheap and dual sim card.,Very_Good
Not even a minor scratch on the phone. It works like magic. I love it. Buying refurbished phones isn't so bad after all.,Very_Good
"This phone is $20. I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that. Let's be real, this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is. If you want it for that purpose, it does every thing you need. If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone, you're going to want to go with something with a little more features. This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag. That's exactly what this phone is for. The controls are not slick, the construction sucks and is cheap, and the sim card is hard to remove, but honestly, if I ever had to use this and the time on that card, chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks.",Very_Good
I love this phone. It has exceeded my expectations and the camera is just fantastic!,Very_Good
"I love this phone. You gotta like it before buying it in order to love it. Firsts days the battery died pretty quick but once you get used to get the most out of it it can hold the day with decent usage. Installed a 32 GB micro sim card and runs without problem. Once I got more used to it, I could surf the web faster and type all kind of messages even faster. The screen can be as bright as you want but for battery life is better to have it very dim. Signal and data transfer works fine, also the hot spot app is very easy to use and can be used while taking a call. Everything at the same time. Overall I'm satisfied with this phone.And for the last but not least this phone is on the list of Motorola to recieve ICS update this year. Looking forward for more functions, hopefully battery saving and new functions!.",Very_Good
"I bought this for my husband to replace his very heavy and cumbersome company cell phone. He loved it! As far as direct connect phones go, this one is great. It's just a little heavier then a pair of sunglasses and very compact. It has an extra large screen and GPS. The features are basic but handles as a phone should. It's also very rugged looking. I just wish it had a camera.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Galaxy S3 on the AT&T network.The beauty of this phone is the ease of setup. I swapped in my SIM card, my SD card, turned it on and signed into my Google account. All my contacts, text messages, apps, settings, even phone history all transferred automatically in less that 10 minutes.This works easily as well as my S3 and it's nice to have a newer phone with a nice bright screen and great battery life.I could only go about a day on my old S3, now can go 3 full days if I need to.No issues at all with the phone of setup. Very glad I purchased it...",Very_Good

It does add a little bulk, but what do you expect, it is an otterbox defender. The colors are beautiful and I feel safer having it on my phone. Would buy again!",Very_Good

"It is the best phone ever! _Ù÷ãThis S4 mini included Spanish as one of the options of language system (I do mention this because we bought another one, a S4 to another seller and it did not include Spanish as one of the language system in spite that it is an international version).It was very easy to set it up at the very beggining. Easy to install apps. Very fast on performing any activity. I love this phone.",Very_Good

"We live outside of the US so when we visit the states, several times a year, we never have a local phone number to use nor do we have access to data from our cell phones. We purchased this because you only pay on the days you use it and it's only like $3.00 per day for unlimited data, text and calls! W could not call home because the unlimited internatinoal doesn't include the Bahamas, but it was still very much worth the cost of the phone. We will keep it and put money on it whenever we go to the states and there is no other hassle to deal with. It's an added bonus that the phone is waterproof as well! We are used to the reaction speed of our iphones, so getting used to the touch screen on this took a day or so, but it worked very well! I highly recommend this phone and the Boost Mobile service.",Very_Good
Excellent sleek smart phone with all the nice features required. Its quite light for its design and the appearance is very nice.,Very_Good
"Love it so far. Was worried about the camera response based on old reviews, but (at least after updates) it is very fast.",Very_Good
"I bought this due to I always travelling to Asia. And I do not need to switch my sim card and I just put my Malaysia and Vietnam sim card then I can use in both country. But the only thing you need to be aware is when you are in one country, make sure when you make a call, you are selecting the correct sim card to make it, otherwise you may use the Vietnam Sim in Malaysia and make the call in Malaysia. You will be killed by roaming charge.",Very_Good
"This phone was in excellent condition, could not detect any wear-and-tear even though it's listed as refurbished. Was exactly what we wanted and very reasonable in price. Actually cheaper than buying at a local store",Very_Good

"I assisted my 81 year old brother with the purchase of this phone and the switch from T-Mobile. He's at a stage in his life where even menial tasks are becoming too complicated. This phone with its large bright screen, simple keypad layout, and higher volume speaker than most other brands is perfect for him. The folks at Great Call (the wireless carrier for the Jitterbug phone) have been very helpful with the transition. I followed the recommendation of another Jitterbug rater and had myself added to my brother's account to act as facilitator.",Very_Good
"Note its screen: wonderful. Look the simplicity and the power at same time. I've had others smartphones, but this one is what I always I've been waiting for.I don't really have any negative point for this splendid phone.",Very_Good
Love the charger...now I can charge my iphone and ipad the right way. Good value.,Very_Good
Wonderful product. Purchased two and both were a hit at Christmas time! Love these types of gifts and always seem to give them to others!,Very_Good
I bought this phone by expecting a lot and I must say that none of my expectations was unsatisfied. The only problem I encountered is that sometimes it can lose reception while the other phones have full reception. Other than that it is a pretty good phone.,Very_Good
Works great and was Like New as advertised. No scratches and no problems with international sim card.,Very_Good
Purchased this for my 15 y/o son and he loves it. Its an upgrade from a LG phone he has had for over a year and he couldnt be more pleased. Phone has a nice size and its HD screen is a winner. Im thinking about buying one for myself so he can teach me how to use it! I still cant fully operate my current phone. Smart phones are obviously smarter than me,Very_Good
"Another excellent, sturdy, attractive case in the Otterbox Defender series, versions of which I've used for the various iPhone models I've owned since my first iPhone 3 many years ago. I've been really happy with the protection the Defender affords. The Defender case (note: this is not the less solid Otterbox Commuter model) protects my phone from all kinds of hazards, such as being dropped, and protects the phone's surface so that it remains pristine (though unseen inside the case) for the life of the phone. All the phone's ports and buttons are easily accessible due to the case's careful design and good manufacturing. While the Defender case does add a bit of extra thickness to the phone, to me it is worth it for the excellent protection it provides, the nice grip it provides when it's in my hand, and the great relief I feel when I accidentally drop the phone on the pavement and nothing bad happens. Highly recommended.",Very_Good

"So far so amazing , phones a great buy.. A lot of people are complaining about the screen and speaker ... Screen is great and speaker is actually louder than I thought",Very_Good
Really like my phone.looks expensive which it is. I didn't know it was a HTC one7 I didn't pay attention to it when I was ordering it I was just looking at the picture of the phone and got excited and ordered it right away because the price was a little down ..I wanted the HTC one 8.so I'm going to keep the phone for a year and then probably the end of the year I will get the one I really want then they'll have something higher than that and I will change my mind about the HTC one 8..then I will get the one that is higher than that.which I know will be a HTC one 9 or 10....if it's not too much for my pocket...i prayi can afford it anyway.,Very_Good
"This phone is awesome.I was a little bit upset that when it arrived it has a small deep crack in the middle of it you cannot notice when it is on and I had already activated it with my sim card so I am keeping it as I can't be without this phone number. We have Samsung s5's and grand prime in the house along with htc and this iPhone the best in my opinion is the s5 and 5c, I love how this is so sleek and compact, the one thing I hate about iPhone is the whole app thing and how they make it a pain to remove ones you do not need. This phone works so smooth and easy besides that.I use this with Verizon and it was so easy to use my nano sim card from previous phone and put it in the iPhone and restart it that is all it took to update my Verizon profile and transfer my phone number etc. Def give this a try.",Very_Good
"Absolutely perfect condition, and 100% perfect functionality. Just wish I could get another one at this great price in the pink :)",Very_Good
These phones work well for the price paid. I had one before but the screen cracked when it was accidentally dropped so I had no reservations about buying another. It has proved itself.,Very_Good

"At $129, its practically disposable.Gone are the days of having get a terrible overseas smart phone with last decade's capabilities when you are on a budget. The Moto E may not be a top of the line phone, but it is fast enough and capable enough for a lot of users. Perfect for kids and older folk who may be looking to get their first smart phone.At this price point, there are no alternatives that even come close. If you have an extra $50, get the Moto G.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone because I wanted a phone with a QWERTY keypad. I am with T-Mobile and I have a no contract plan. The phones they were offering with the prepaid were not that great, so I began looking for a nice phone with the features I wanted without having to pay an arm and a leg. Sim card went right in and I had no interuption in service. The phone is great for texting, has games, and even allows you to get on the internet.I did have one prob. Initially I could not receive or send picture and video messages. However, I called T-Mobile and they were able to resolve the issue for me.So I am very pleased with this phone. I am glad I made the purchase. Looks like a high dollar phone for not so much money. Love it!",Very_Good
Excellent cell phone! it works terrific with movistar ve. Available several languages including Spanish. recommended!,Very_Good
This was my first smartphone. The only negative things I could say about it is that all of the additional software that Samsung places on it take half of your storage for apps but you can still use microSD cards for large files. The one I recieved was the German model so it came with the adapter to use standard US outlets but every time I updated the OS 3 apps totally in German kept reappearing so I just had to uninstall them. All around great phone with beautiful screen.,Very_Good
"awesome service, they were very helpful in finding the model i needed. Very good with communication back and forth with questions",Very_Good
"The need to purchase this Photon was prompted by my first Photon taking a plunge to the bottom of a lake. The Photon is a great phone and I'm puzzled why Motorola discontinued making it after only several month's on the market. If you are looking for a dependable 4G smartphone this is a good one. One word of caution when purchasing this phone online is that it doesn't come standard with a SIM card. I don't have the need for one at the moment as my carrier Sprint doesn't require the use of one while operating my phone in the U.S. I am not sure what other carriers require, so be aware.",Very_Good
"I'm very happyMy new smartphone is nice, is excelent, samsung galaxy S III is the bestBlackBerry is out",Very_Good

"Very sturdy, no problems even after dropping the phone. It's a full-360 cage that covers and protects the screen too without any loss of function. It's not intuitive how to open the inner cage in order to install the phone, but there are youtube videos on how to do it.",Very_Good

"After looking at comparing prices among other Smartphones I can tell you that the HP8945 is the best you can get out there, I've seen P990's and Qtek's smartphone series at similar pricing than this and I can assure you there's just no comparison among them. The HP8945 is a PC turned into a smartphone, as the others are phones trying to become a PC.",Very_Good
"When I received this phone because I had one previously I thought this on was not the same, however as I began to study this phone I realized that it had some features that my previous phone did not have and that impressed me.

I want to start off by saying I have owned a lot of phones in my day and this phone has to be my favorite android to date the stock andoid covered with the Zen UI is just a pleasue to use and can be fully customised to your liking that along with the 128gb of storage make this phone a phone lovers dream phone with 4 gigs of ram this phone will perform flawless even under stress of heavy gameing the quick charger will always keep your phone juiced up too my phone chargers in about 45 mins from almost dead.Now for cons the battery is ....minimal for a phone this powerful they should have had a way bigger battery but that's not to say this phone won't last you all day its just not the greatest battery life I have seen but I guess they had to cut costs somewhere right ?

"I have read many reviews who h say that the phone gets a weaker signal than the at&t or the T-Mobile version of the phone which S are me a little but I decided to buy the phone anyway. I got the phone and I compared it's signal with my S6 Edge at&t version and this international version did show less bars but I believe it's because it's programmed slightly differently but the strength of the signal is the same if not better. I noticed that is some places where my at&t version couldn't load stuff because of a weak signal this international version loaded it my much better, also the phone came with the factory seal untouched, no fake one on top of it",Very_Good

"My father is a remodeled who doesn't want a smartphone in a bulletproof case, he wants a simple flip phone that makes calls (he doesn't even use the text messaging). Problem is, he remodels houses all day and all his past phones have met tragic demises off ladders, tailgates, etc. I watched him drop this phone onto the floor from a 6' ladder while trying to dig it out of his pocket to answer a call. I reached down and answered it (I know that isn't the only time it has been dropped). His favorite thing to do is turn on the speaker so he can continue working while talking to you. It is reasonably clear and loud on both sides of the call (unless he forgets and walks to the other side of the room). The interface is pretty simple and straight forward, but the phone has a good amount of features. Does it have all the modern bells and whistles, no and that's the point. It is one of the last good rugged basic flip phones that I have found.",Very_Good

"I have bought this phone cause when i was in Afghanistan, i was going to my trip to Europe for R&R. This phone works great. Just arrived to Germany, bought a Sim card which was 5euro's and then i paid for a prepaid plan. Poped in the sim card and walla! It worked! Also work in Afghanistan when i had the sim card for there as well!!! Amazing! Definitely works in other countries sim cards. Battery would last me 3-4 days without charging if i didnt use it at all. 1-2 days when i did used it alot! Great phone very durable as well. Looks to be waterproof although I never tried wetting it! Why try to wet a perfectly good phone!? Anyways I would highly recommend this phone if you need it just for talking and txting world wide. I wouldnt buy if you need it for data or for work internationally. If you need something like that get yourself a unlocked iphone or something like that.",Very_Good

"I received my phone on 12/24/2008, and I just love it! At first I wanted to get an iphone, but the $30 extra monthly for the iphone set me back. I've always been a fan of Nokia due to their great reception, battery life, and durability. I went into the Nokia flagship store in NYC during Thanksgiving break, and I saw this beautiful phone, and I just had to have it. I checked on Amazon, and it was on sale! Saved $100.As soon as it arrived, I just inserted my ATT SIM card, and it was good to go. Some of the contacts did not transfer from my previous Nokia phone, so I had to do that by hand :/. I got the ATT media net package for $15/month, and the internet works great everywhere, it is very fast. Setting up email was very easy, just had to type in the user name and password. Calendar is very user friendly, I use it all the time, and I think the camera is pretty good considering it is a phone camera. All in all, a great smartphone, no complaints, highly recommended!!",Very_Good
"I tend to destroy phones, so I have bought two of these types of phones. This phone is great!! Clean ESN, screen scratch free, only a couple marks on the corner of the plastic, near perfect condition. I was surprised and decided this time to get a protective case to keep it in the near new condition. I have tried to repair my old phones with no luck, This is a great alternative for a few dollars more, just plug in your Verizon ESN chip and your nearly done after the initial set up.",Very_Good
"The cell works great, and I love the fact that can be used for two sim. I recommend the cell.",Very_Good
"I really like this phone, But it's not fit for everybody. It might be too big to some of you, but that was what i liked the most in this phone, i barely use my computer now!

"Phone is in perfect condition, it's been working pretty good so far and the 64 gb memory is more than enough for me to install all the apps I need, copy all my iTunes library and still have a lot space available for anything else.The model # i received is the A1429 wich doesn't work with 4G LTE networks only 3G or at least that's what it shows on the top of the screen even when I enabled the 4G option in settings/cellular menu.But I can live with the 3G network because everything else in this phone is great.",Very_Good

"I love this phone so much. I don't know how BLU is able to sell such high quality phones for an affordable price! I hate phone contracts so I'm on an AT&T prepaid phone plan. The phones that AT&T sells for its prepaid users are either outdated or too expensive because you have to pay full price and don't get a phone discount because you're not on a contract. (That's how they get you)I am so glad I came across this phone and am now aware that BLU exists because their phones are so nice and affordable. I specifically bought this product because of its camera, 8 megapixels camera in front and 16 in back?! You can't buy anything close to as good for $250. My only regret is buying the 16gb memory phone instead of the 32gb one. The downside to the phone is that you cannot add more memory so if you download a lot of apps and take a lot of pictures than I would suggest spending a little more money for the 32gb phone.",Very_Good
"Phone is beautiful. Came on time. Only for European use, no English instructions. Good for use in Israel. Please read description carefully to be sure that the phone is right for your country. Thanks!",Very_Good
"I got it for the iphone 6 plus and it has already prevented disaster. Honestly, it doesn't add that much extra bulk to the phone. I compared it tony husband's iPhone 5 otter box which is much bulkier",Very_Good
"I bought this watch for my husband, for Father's Day. He always wanted a smart watch and has been complaining about not having a watch for a while now. I seen this watch, read the reviews and decided to purchase because of the great valued price. Shipping was fast and packaging was good but with the packaging, it does look very generic. That needs to be updated. The watch is great and well made. The touchscreen is perfect. Absolutely no flaws with the product itself. It has many great features- Bluetooth, texting, calls, clocks, pedometer, sleep etc. If you're looking to buy a smart watch but don't want to pay a steep price, I do recommend this watch! Please rate my review helpful if you found it helpful. Thank you for reading my review!",Very_Good

"I LOVE THIS PHONE! for what it is, a feature phone. Get one on Amazon, if you can. I have had mine for more than 2 years, and it takes great pictures, zooms, and even captures motion. It is great for making and receiving calls, and even does a good job of surfing the internet and playing you tube videos. It is by no means a ""smart phone"", but for the $10 data plan on Verizon, it meets all my needs. Battery life is ok, but only good for about 2 days, or 1 day with heavy use. It is 10X better than the Samsung Reality which replaced it. I am stuck with Verizon in our area, and am waiting until they get a Samsung Windows 8 phone before I replace this. I liked it so much I have a second one to use just in case I don't want to pay for an expensive data plan.",Very_Good

"I really like this phone. It works smooth and processes fast. Music and videos play clear and without any problems. The size (5.5"") of the screen and the overall size of the phone is perfect. This came as unlocked for the Americas region. But it came with instructions that to use this phone outside of the Americas, you have to make a cumulative 5 minute call with an American SIM card. When I inserted a Philippine SIM card in Roaming mode, a popup appeared to type an unlock code. So I followed the directions and made calls with ATT and TMobile. Then I inserted the Philippine SIM card again and it worked! No unlock code required. I will be going to Asia in a few months and will find out if this phone is truly unlocked outside of the Americas region.",Very_Good

"This is an upgrade from my old Droid Bionic. Everything is faster and better looking. Loads apps in about 1/3 the time. Plenty of space with 16Gb. WiFi reception is worse (fewer bars compared to Bionic), but still works great. Bluetooth connects quickly and sounds great. Easy activation, went to a Verizon corporate store, got a new SIM card (Bionic SIM card was bigger, wouldn't fit in the MotoX) and walked out 5 minutes later with a much better phone. So far not a single hiccup at all. Awesome phone.",Very_Good

"I have been a Samsung Galaxy owner before, but decided to make a change to a phone that started good then got worst.I used to own the s3 and I'm glad I made a comeback to Samsung once again.The international version seems to be faster and have a longer battery life than the last phone I used to own. With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work.The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far.I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy.The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant.As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower.This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view.",Very_Good

Love Otterbox. Keeps the phone from shattering. Rubber edges mean I can lean the iphone on a smooth table and not have the thing slip and fall flat.,Very_Good
"Great phone. Although it was refurbished, It came in a perfect condition. I really congratulate the seller... really good job!The phone itself is as it is written on paper... it is super fast. It opens apps in a second... of course it has 2gb of ram and that makes the safari usage real fluent...The camera is pretty good too.The texture, the weight.., everything perfect (for me)And the battery life... it's amazing... If it is in 100%, and you use the phone heavily, it will only drain like 8%-10% in one hour... It's mind blowing.Totally happy with it!",Very_Good

"As a first time iPhone owner I can't say why this phone is better than another. But I will thus far, i am impressed with my new [to me but used] iPhone 4S. Pictures are great, seems to be a decent speed for running applications. Even the ios7 seems to work good. The only drawback, like most phones, especially used, is the battery life. But overall I enjoy my Verizon Wireless Apple IPhone 4S.",Very_Good

"Stylish AND works great! What a concept. The clarity and reception on this phone really blows me away. I can actually hear the conversation when driving in the car!The price is high and I recommend getting a case. Amazon lists it as coming with a leather case, but I did not receive one. (**update: Amazon did in fact send me a case for the phone after I inquired about it. It didn't fit though. I ended up paying almost 30.00 for one at the Cingular store.) As of yet, they have not got back to me regarding that matter. A little deceptive about what comes with it, (cases are expensive) but it does not take anything from the phone itself.I love it!(UPDATE*** Also, now that I have had the phone for a while, I wanted to state that some people have stated the battery life isn't good with this phone. I have had NO problems at all and today is #5 that it hasn't been on the charger.)",Very_Good

"Love it! A Samsung steal! A cheap phone chock full of many bells and whistles. Shipping was fast, phone was as described and works with my local network..",Very_Good
"The unit has performed very well thus far. No problems with ATT compatibility - strong reception, works well teathered. With the Moto-mod camera affixed, it is an ideal solution to having both a phone and decent if not spectacular camera along for the ride (and the price for the bundle was the clincher). Battery life seems fine, the quick recharge is helpful. It seems to recharge fastest from the Motorola charger; I have used other Qualcomm 3.0 chargers - its says ""turbo charging"" when connected - but the charge time seems to be noticeably longer...",Very_Good
Perfect fit but hard to put on because I don't have nails. It took me 2 years to find this and with the right price. I'm glad I kept looking. I do want to keep my 2012 Samsung galaxy note 10.1 for a long time.,Very_Good
"This is a beautiful colour, the phone came as it was described, this is my seventh day of usage and it has not fail me yet.

"This phone just blows your other phones out of the water. It quite literally is the best phone out there. If you buy itbrand new, international, Amazon is kind enough to include an adapter for the phone for wherever they are shipping the device to. The phone, brand new takesa few updates that'll take take around 3 hours to finish, but once you're done, it's Marshmallow(latest Android update) heaven baby. The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks. And the heat is not a bad thing, that just means your phone is doing work.I give this phone a 5/5 for now let's wait for the upcoming weeks.",Very_Good

This Nokia cellphone does what it was advertised for...I just need a phone with no frills just something to use in calling. Works well with T-mobile pay-as-U-go. Got it at a good price too (under $85).Simple features with practical use. FM radio is a big help when you need to hear about traffic or weather when you are riding a public transportation.,Very_Good
"This phone is where its at. Nice and fast, super snappy. The only problem was that the battery life is not great but that was no longer a problem when I got a battery case.",Very_Good
"There is always a risk in buying refurbished items, but I must say this one exceeded my expectations. Upon opening the package the phone looked brand knew. The functionality is almost perfect, very fast, clear and haven't had any problems so far. The only feature I can lament about is the battery. It works well, on a 100% charge and frequent use I can probably get 7-14 hours out of it, but it is definitely evident that it is not a new battery and it has been used a bit, nothing surprising there. Of course you should be cautious and keep in mind that you never know what kind of wear the phone and the battery have had, you might get stuck with a almost dead battery that will most likely frustrate you.I would however recommend the phone to anyone that is looking for an advanced working smartphone at a low budget.Chears",Very_Good

I'm 75 yrs.old and use a PC, iPad, and 3 Kindles. I particularly wanted this type of phone for texting, and find that with a little help from my granddaughter I've been able to pick up operating this phone with tolerable ease. I did a lot of investigating before buying and I recommend buying this phone from Amazon, unlocked, and use Consumer Cellular as server.",Very_Good

"I was reluctant to purchase this phone because it has no warranty. However I decided it was worth the risk and purchased it, and I am very glad that I did. This is a great phone. It has very clear communication with phone calls, and is extremely fast with internet functions. The battery is lasting for 40 to 48 hours on a charge. The included ear buds are great. I did not even know they were included. They sound fantastic when playing music, and there is a built in microphone for when a phone call comes in while you are playing music.I have been using this phone for 3 weeks, and I am so happy with it that I purchased another one for my wife. She received hers in 3 days and is also very satisfied.",Very_Good

"I think this is one of the best basic phones lg has made. My husband has had this phone for a long time he has run over it, dropped it in water and drops it all the time and it still makes and receives calls and texts. (Despite cracking the outside screen when it was run over) The battery has held up for more than 2 years. We recently replaced this phone with the lgenv3 and even though it is a decent phone it does not have the same quality as the env2, the env3 feels cheap when compared next to this one and the battery life of it is way shorter.",Very_Good
Great phone! Doesn't have any scratches and works great! Exactly what displayed and advertised as well as what I was expecting!,Very_Good

"A really amazing Windows phone for the price...a perfect starter phone for a teenager or replacement phone for an adult.Great call quality, very good battery life, tough glass, above-average camera, easy to use. When you upgrade the software to Windows Phone 8.1 (see You Tube for how), you get bigger, faster, better, easier to use for free. Can't beat NOKIA for overall value...the liquidator that I bought from repackaged the phone into more generic packaging that is not as nice as what you see here, my only negative issue.",Very_Good
Its exactly what I paid for. Phone works like brand new. Very satisfied. Thank you!! :D,Very_Good

"This phone is AWESOME! It has great specs and a great price tag. My only pet peeve is the on screen buttons are VERY sensitive and therefore difficult to touch.

"I bought the white version of the Samsung S7 edge and it is a amazing and gorgeous phone. It was really difficult to find it because it's not available for the US but it totally worth the trouble. I got the italian edition of it and it works nice and smooth with my Mexican SIM card, it doesn't has any preloaded content which is great and the preinstalled apps are the same as the US version. The only ""issue"" might be that the power connector of the charger is European, but the seller solved it in a great way by including an American adapter. I love my new phone and the whole experience was excellent with this seller.I used to be an iPhone lover, but Samsung did a great jog with this one and I'm perfectly happy of having taked the risk. Totally recommended!",Very_Good

"Arrived a month earlier than expected date. I couldn't be any happier with these phones for the price. I ordered 2. One for my mom and one for myself. They are fast, smooth, have a beautiful bright IPS display and 3g internet. I know someone mentioned in another review that they couldn't get 3g internet on these devices. We use Giv Mobile's 30.00 plan and both have 3G internet showing. Have been using mine nonstop to play basic games, widgets, apps, everything an affordable smartphone should be able to do. Very happy with the seller and brand of phone.I forgot to mention the construction of the phones is nicer than I expected. They are slender with a nice sturdy removable back cover that hides a removable battery, 2 sim card slots and a micro SD slot. Nice camera as well, however the description is misleading about the megapixels of the camera. I was a little disappointed upon arrival but still satisfied. There is an 8mp back camera not 13mp.",Very_Good

"Great phone!! I'm going on a month with my zenfone 2 laser and I couldn't be happier. The quality is good, and easy to operate. I really like the double tap on the screen to turn it on or off. You can use the power button to turn the screen on, but the double tap is easier.My only complaint so far is the vibrate function on it. It could be that I haven't figure out the settings, but when it's in my pocket and it rings, I don't feel the vibrate compared to my old moto G. Other than that, I love this phone and I would suggest this to anyone looking for a new phone. By the way, I have the 32gb one.",Very_Good

I like the refined waterproofing design.This phone doesn't seem to jump/slide off everything like my Z3C - but I used the Ringke Fusion case for it anyway.The fingerprint unlock is an excellent feature - can be a little problematic, but usually gets it right on the 2nd/3rd try.I have a 200Gb Sandisk MicroSD installed - just about the right amount for Music/Pictures/Maps.",Very_Good

"I've had the original Moto G for years and love it. When the 4G came out I was reticent because of reviews alleging a heat problem. I decided to get a 4G plus. At first I was a bit put-off by the larger size, which doesn't feel as comfortable as the smaller G. I also noticed that the unit indeed warms up occasionally, when using the camera. After awhile I got used to the size, and came to really appreciate the larger, high rez screen. The camera is excellent. Audio can sound a bit tinny if too loud, but that's a minor complaint. Build quality is excellent. Overall a great phone.",Very_Good

"I've been very pleased with the HP Veer. I have one of the discontinued Touchpads, so the UI is very familiar. I feel like it hits a sweet spot in terms of functionality -- I don't need to use the smart phone functions much. The phone is small enough to fit in the change pocket in my jeans. It picks up my voice well, which is a problem for some phones I've tried.It's been working well as a Go Phone on AT&T's network. I haven't yet tested tethering, or integrating it with the Touchpad.",Very_Good

"Turned out to be a great phone. I bought in advance of our trip to Italy mostly to call family in the states and restaurants etc. here. Was without phone service until we reached Florence and bought a SIM card at Vodafone. 300 minutes for 30 euro. Only issue I had was loading the card. I think I broke the first slot. Let the Vodaphone agent load the card into slot 2. Charged the phone once every 10 days! Old fashioned texting. Practiced all the functions while we waited in the airport. Nice alarm clock. No camera. Italian phone number. Bought a SIM at JFK which was a mistake, expensive and did not work well. It appeared that there was a phone store at Pisa Airport.",Very_Good

Great phone for a great price. In this tough economy its wise to save money and I don't have $800 to spend on a phone just because it has a brand logo on there while this same BLU gives me the same high performance that any other Android smartphone does. It gives me the freedom to use any company I want on it since its unlocked.,Very_Good

It may not be the best phone right now but it is an awesome bang for the buck and i enjo using it alot.",Very_Good
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,Very_Good
"For the price, this is the best phone out there. Hands down. The resolution on the screen is superb whether it's for reading my favorite book, or watching 1080HD videos or movies. The only downside of this phone is that the camera isn't great so don't count on making great videos or taking photos with superb quality. But I sure as hell happy that there is a front facing camera-- which was an upgrade for me.I would recommend this to a friend. This is a great phone. It's great that this has the microSD slot so you can always add more storage to this baby.",Very_Good
We bought these phones for our 9 week tour through Europe. It had dual sims which made it nice to buy two different sims to have coverage in the countries we visited. This phone is nothing fancy but meets your need for phone calls if someone should need to contact you. You can send and receive basic text messages and make country to country phone calls. Check out this phone to save money by not buying a expensive USA plan for Europe.,Very_Good

"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GBYWMO0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0I got two of these to replace my kids phones. I didn't want to upgrade and trust that 2 teenagers would be responsible enough to care for an expensive phone. But at the same time I didn't want to give them a phone that wasn't reliable. This is perfect match of just enough and good price. It looks expensive and like the tablets they have, but I didn't have to restart a contract, I just went to ATT and had them put in a new SIM card with their phone numbers on them. This was a much easier way to deal with teenagers and ""Smart phones"". I have it where they can only use the wifi, no data, and the picture quality is nice, which is a big plus for them. This way they feel like their getting something really big and I'm not out an arm and leg.",Very_Good

"This is the smartest phone I have ever had, so I am still discovering all the bells and whistles. The pen function has made the expense worth it. I was able to take notes from a selectboard meeting to write a news article, but I am still learning how to run the filing system and whether Evernote is a better choice. I had to get a new sim card, as this takes a micro sim.card.",Very_Good
"I love my new note 3! I was worried at first because the phone is used, but when it came (earlier than expected!) I couldn't tell it had been used besides a small scratch. But it's a great bargain!",Very_Good

"If you are a windows/office everyday person and really don't need very specific apps, then this phone works great. I'm all about connectivity. Calendars, tasks, phone numbers and mails. Windows had worked hard to put out apps that make your life easier when dealing with daily chores on your work. Office works awesome...REAL office that is. Battery is good. Video and audio are pretty awesome too. Oh and don't forget Cortana (your personal assistant) Microsoft said this is the last Lumia phone they will ever build and now they are focusing on developing a Surface phone just like the tablet, well I own the tablet so I'll be in line for the surface phone.",Very_Good
"I am very happy with my Galaxy S4. The screen size is great but it's still easy to carry in my pocket or purse. It arrived as promised the day after I placed the order. As others have mentioned, they were purchased overseas, so the plug and users guide are not US standards. They did include an English version quick start guide and the cord works with any standard USB plug, so it is well worth it for the cost savings. I would buy again.",Very_Good

"I've had a Lumia 920 that for me is still a really good phone.But when I compare my 920 with the new 1520 the difference is gigantic in many ways.First of all, the size. It's a big phone, but in my opinion is not an enormous.The size helps a lot when you are typing, by the way it has the best keyboard I've ever used.The other thing that jumps to your when you first use it is the quality of the screen. The colors are so vivid that is hard to go back to my 920 after using the 1520.It also has a really fast CPU (the Snapdragon 800) that makes the navigation so smooth.The battery is also impressive, I can use it for at least a day and half without having to charge ir.And finally, the camera. Although it has not the 1020 41mp camera, this 20mp camera still beats all other cell phone cameras in the market.After using the 1520 with the upgraded WP8, I found myself looking at Android phones and Iphones, and thinking they all look the same crap compared to the Lumia.",Very_Good
I was so happyabout this iphone. Its flawless front and back body case. So far i am not having problem with it. My Nephew wil be happy as i send it to the Philippines:) willbe glad to buy another one with Buymax!!!Kiyomi,Very_Good
"This Nokia Lumia 820 unlocked GSM phone is working fine with an AT&T prepaid sim card.. I do not know whether this will work in India also.. will get to know only when back to India by the end of next month.. Hope this will work there too in a prepaid sim.. The price of the phone has got down to $232.00 would you please get me the price match and refund the balance, I can have more and more purchase from you.. Thanks..",Very_Good
"This phone is great, all my apps work well and the battery life is suuficient for someone who listens to music on their way to work and uses social media throughout the day. I only have to charge my phone once a day depending on how often I use it. I don't play games so I can't say much about the battery life in reagrds to that. But for regular daily usage it is just great and the cameras take good pictures. Howeverr the phone restarts itself from time to time I'm not sure this happens though, but apart from that everything works well.",Very_Good
"This Samsung is very nice, is my first android phone and i very satsified is very powerfull and and its size is perfect",Very_Good
"It is an excellent cellphone, it has all the necesary, internet, wifi, and every thing that you need, to work, and for all.... And in the case you live in a dangerous place, it is not an desirable one... so, you can use it in the street very quetly...",Very_Good
"I love this case works so well. It works great in the water, no worries of it getting wet. I love the fact that I am touching my screen instead of having a plastic cover over it like most phone cases have. Make it so much easier to use my phone. It is great at keeping your phone protect too. I drop mine all the time and my phone and case are still in great condition.",Very_Good
"Good afternoon. I received the package smoothly, everything came good and fast. excellent phone. works wonders, the pants camera fabulous, everything is fine. Many many thanks Amazon",Very_Good
"Although the phone arrived locked, the seller replied to my message within one day with the unlock code. The phone is otherwise perfect and exactly as described, 4G works without a hitch in Australia.Amazing build quality as always from Nokia/Microsoft, price and the chipset aside it truly feels like a premium flagship but luckily the Windows OS is very light and speedy so it doesn't need the overbearing CPU power and RAM that android devices need to run smoothly. The camera is an absolute joy in good and bad light. Color reproduction is spot on and very vibrant. Zero complaint about the phone, I could care less about the congested app store on android and iOS. I just want a simplistic, solid, premium phone and this is just that.The seller was BREED, very well mannered and despite needing one more day to get the phone unlocked, I really appreciate how quickly resolved the issue for me. I would buy from them again for sure but in the future I think it would be better if you guys just shipped the unlock code!",Very_Good
"I have been looking for a basic phone just like this one with big keypad for my father, he is 75 yrs old and hard of hearing. My father really likes the phone because the ring volume is loud & he can see the big keypad. Also he doesn't know how to send pictures so he don't need a camera nothing fancy. Highly recommended for senior or if you just want a basic phone.",Very_Good
The phone is great for the price. Lot better than samsung mega. If huawei can do thus just imagine what they can do with premium phone.,Very_Good
"I love the color. This one was made better then the last one I had. My service was just great, and my order came faster than I thought.",Very_Good
This is a great phone! I got it to replace a phone that didnt meet my needs for internal memory. My new MotoX Developer GSM has 32 gigs of internal memory which is great. The phone size fits my hand perfect. The clarity of the pictures is extraordinary and I'm easily able to multitask on the phone. On the downside the battery life is short. All in all this is a super phone for my needs.,Very_Good
I have absolutely no issues with the phone. It works fine and I love it.The delivery was on time. My only complaint is that the box was unsealed but everthing was new in it.,Very_Good
This phone is extremely nice. The display is gorgeous not to mention the pictures that this camera produces. I highly recommend this phone to any one looking for a high quality phone.,Very_Good
The Google Nexus has been a good phone gor my almost 15 year old. He mostly plays games and watches streaming videos and is pleased. This has been a good choice of phone.,Very_Good
I like the clear screen and the extra features that it has more than a standard‰ÛÜ flip phone.,Very_Good
"The phone works wonderfully. Can't really tell it was used. I used it in the US with a T mobile sim and now in France-- no issues. The price was great, too. Just can't imagine spending more on a phone that could get lost or stolen, and this does everything.",Very_Good
"Only had it about 2weeks so I'm an old ""newbie"". The Lucia does everything I wanted and more. Still learning but a relatively easy set up and go. I haven't been successful in bringing over contacts but I'm home now and will just use the computer to do it. Highly recommended even for 70 year old grandma.",Very_Good
"This is a great phone. 20.7 megapixel camera and waterproof. Those were to the two main features that attracted me to this phone. The speaker on the phone is not that great, but the quality and build of the phone makes up for that one potential downfall. I had this phone for about 3 months now and I don't regret buying it at all. Sony did a great job with this phone.",Very_Good
"I had no complaints with this but we decided it was time to get a smartphone. But, this little Samsung was great.",Very_Good
"I got this phone for my wife and so far she really likes it, it is easy to use, stylish, has many features, very good reception (our provider is att) & the battery life is very good as well. It is not a smartphone but it has a very good browser with excellent wifi access, internet radio etc and it does an excellent job in features that I usually use in my Sony Xperia ion smartphone with a price much less than a classic smartphone.",Very_Good
"Awesome phone. Picks up signals where other phones failed. Really fast internet. Looks expensive too. Lots of compliments.i personally will like the entire phone to reflect the color chosen, not just the back. Other than that great buy.",Very_Good
This is my first smart phone. Easy to use and very reliable. An excellent phone for the price. Camera is great. If you want a solid phone at a great price buy this one. Don't overpay for one from your carrier.,Very_Good
"I needed a dual-SIM phone that works in both the US and Europe, and with a very long battery life. This phone ticks all the boxes. Sound quality during calling is very good, the keypad is good (if a bit noisy when pressing the buttons). Two nice bonuses are the FM radio and the flashlight. The FM radio even works without headphones connected and plays the stations through the speakers, which produce a clear sound. The flashlight is the brightest I have ever seen on a phone, much brighter than my friend's iphone. The size of the phone is also quite small, which is refreshing in these days of phablets and what not. The price is also small. This may not be a smart phone... but I would call it a Swiss Army phone. Battery lasts for over a week. For the price, you can't go wrong.",Very_Good

These were resons for me to purchase the pair in the first place.My nieghbor came over to borrow the phone and is amazed at the quality and the sound of the Tundra.Three Tundras, with one that was defective and replaced immediately with no hassles, and four people that love the phone.",Very_Good

"version is the 7562L, works well in Venezuela, MOVILNET, MOVISTAR and should work well for digitel. updated version of the software, connect it to the PC right from the start without problems. personally I'm using to MOVILNET, the connection is slow, for MOVISTAR is faster.Sometimes the phone is slow when turning or especially when communicating with BBM or facebook messeger.Anyway, the phone is good, unlocked, and cheap compared to the mini S3.I hope you have served my opinion on this device",Very_Good
"I believe it is an under rated phone. Phone did not charge well at first because a default setting was for screen to stay on while charging. Phone would not charge during entire night. I'm not a fan of LG wall paper and utilities. I love Nova Launcher, even though every time a get a new phone I try about 2 days without, but none are as good and customizable. Other than that, this is a great $400+ phone. And of course the camera is awesome. I am a photographer and love using manual mode. I used to keep a SLR camera in my car truck, for those spontaneous moments of nature. Now I'm confident that I can capture and excellent image with my phone (no zoom of course).",Very_Good
"Phone got here rather quickly. Phone service was working by simply transferring the T-mobile SIM card from old phone to new phone. Charge the battery, power on. Done.",Very_Good

"Yep, I'm one of those people who doesn't want a smart phone. I bought this to replace one exactly like it that I drowned. It's a phone! It makes calls! It gets calls! That's all I ask of it, and it delivers just fine. Yes, I know the lovers of smart phones will say it's a dinosaur. But if I drown this one, too, I haven't lost anything but an inexpensive phone, meaning all I have to do is reload my contact list, and boogie on. I like the bluetooth feature, because I can drive hands-free. Simple is good. So is the sound quality, charging time and battery life, the light weight, and the small size. Nothing bad about this phone except it can't swim.",Very_Good
This phone is really awesome... Under 300$ unlocked!!! You just can't beat that with the specs it has. Also its a developer edition so you can do all the tinkering you want if your into stuff like that like me. Easy bootloader unlocking. Overall I'm happy with my purchase..,Very_Good
My phone works perfect in Venezuela! As soon as I got it I placed the simcard and it worked immediately.,Very_Good
I moved to Norway and needed an unlocked phone. This phone worked with 2 different phone companies in Norway and was Brand new in a box.,Very_Good
it was exactly the way it was described I'm very satisfied with the shipping and the product,Very_Good
"it is an awesome phone but and I bought it from seller: Wireless Extra. Good company and good response. Everything came brand new except there were no headphones, but if your cellphone comes with headphone, they are crap headphones anyways, so its really not a big deal. It is a wonderful phone, just read reviews on which seller you buy it from. Be a smart consumer.",Very_Good
buen celular cohe en todo los paises inclusive en ecuador es completo tiene d todo les recomiendo,Very_Good
Works like a charm. I broke the screen but it took 10+ drops and a massive plummet to even accomplish that. Truly a God send. Thank God,Very_Good
"This phone allows me to work and play from just about anywhere. It is my alarm clock and reminder for very important things. I can see a full size calendar anytime, view my agenda list is just a few steps away. I can take pictures, view photos, listen to music, watch movies, and surf the Web -- all on a big enough screen so I don't have to squint. People who are not technology savvy just don't understand why you'd pay so much for a phone, but this phone is not just a phone, it's a computer, too. I can edit documents, save files locally or to the cloud and never miss a beat when I'm off from work or at work. The S Pen allows me to jot notes; instead of typing, I can just write. The phone knows when I have removed the pen and beeps if I have left it behind.",Very_Good
Works great. This is the third phone of this type we've owned in six years.,Very_Good
"Excellent phone made by nokia. he shipping was fast, I love this phone, I also have a nokia lumia 920 and both work perfectly",Very_Good

I recomend this device over any htc, iphone, or samsung. Awsome product, good quality, a must buy.",Very_Good
"As the title say, this is a very good tablet indeed. Love it. Screen clear, even when using it outside, battery charge lasts, wifi doesn't drop out and the tablet is fast and responsive. Can't fault it. I'm guessing this is an international model as it came from gsmHero with a UK charger/adapter and a US converter - this was perfect for me as I travel, but may annoy others. I'm also using it with an international SIM so it is definitely unlocked and perfect for people who travel abroad.",Very_Good
"Big, light weight, affordable, AMAZING. Lots of space, amazing picture quality. Hold a peace sign up for The Flash to go off.",Very_Good
I had no problems getting it hooked up with my carrier and have not had any issues come up with the phone. I have had it for several months with no problems,Very_Good

"Nokia-mania, I wanted a phone Blackberry-like, but from Nokia. A phone with Internet capability. A phone with dictionaries. A phone to make my office with (I was accustommed with the Nokia communicators with MS Office and so on). A phone with wide keyboard. A compact phone you can easily handle. A phone with GPS. And a phone which simply phones and eventually take pictures. Nokia E75 is all that. I have replaced the micro SD card by a microSDHC card (8GB): so I can even use my phone as a flash disk... My only question: why not a 5 megapixels camera? E75 is the phone for your various situations...",Very_Good
"Terrific phone, with lots of memory. When picking out a screen protector, be sure to specify the 'Plus' version, to make sure there's a cutout for the fingerprint sensor (which works great, btw)",Very_Good
Not as good as my m8 but as a refurbished phone as good as expected,Very_Good
"The item as described by the seller. It's new and you don't need to do anything. It comes with original screen protector film for front and rear. They gave me one more OTG cable. 4G work in usa. It's not any carrier network's logo and preloaded apps phone. Because I've got wrong with another two seller before. They sold vodafone version. But they have good communication and refund my money. I've spend extra money for two times return ship. So, choose my suggestion if you want to buy this phone. I don't want to talk about this phone any more. Because I'm sony crazy. This phone is excellent by the price.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone for my wife when her old one stopped working all of a sudden. It is a great deal for the price. The screen is large size, excellent resolution, and very bright. The phone is light weight and slim. We use it with Tmobile and it definitely does get 4gLTE coverage in Midwest US and Texas. The only problem is relatively short battery life compared to other phones I've had, but for the great price and use with no-contract plan I have to give 5 stars. I highly recommend.",Very_Good
i love this phone it is a god phone and i recumend it to everyone it doeverthig i need it to do,Very_Good
"Phone arrived on time. Condition was as promised. Battery/screen/controls all in great shape. I had intentions to use phone on wifi network only (no cell service). I was surprised to find that even if you don't use cellular or voice data, you still MUST have a SIM card in the phone to activate it.. and the phone doesn't come with one. I purchased an AT&T Nano-SIM card on Amazon for about $6. Without one, you can't get past the welcome screen in the new iPhone setup process. All you can do is make an emergency call. Would have been nice to include a disclaimer to this effect. Just a slight nuisance. Phone otherwise works perfectly.",Very_Good
"Excellent !!!, I am delighted with the phone, super fast, with incredible screen and the colors and images Super tastefully designed. I recommend it. And it works excellent in Venezuela. I give it 5 stars.",Very_Good
"I just got this phone on Saturday the 27th of February 2010 and it has been nothing but perfect. I had an iPod touch and it worked ok, I could only sync note to outlook which I don't use and I can't delete music from the device but the nokia e63 is totally opposite, I use it as a flash drive. I can store anything on this phone and transfer it wirelessly to any computer via Bluetooth. The phone is the perfect price at just $189 it is really affordable, the camera loads with in 3 seconds and takes great pictures for 2 megapixels. The email app was amazingly easy to setup and use. This is a great phone, it's not flashy at all and it works great. It's the perfect phone",Very_Good
"Exactly what I expected and has worked out perfectly. It got here earlier than expected and have had absolutely no problems,",Very_Good

"Bought this after visits to 2 Apple stores revealed that the stores cannot just sell you an iPhone outright (they want payments or a contract or some other undesirable). Such an experience is dumbfounding, indeed! THANK YOU Amazon for saving me from another disappointing visit to what Apple calls a ""store""!! Apple locations are prisons of torture followed by frustration that I cannot spend my money there. I hope to never set foot in one again. Too bad I like their products so much!!",Very_Good
"Everything was ok. Recommended! The phone works fine and arrived in scheduled and i have no complains. If you wanna buy, buy it.",Very_Good
"I recently purchased this phone after losing my Windows Phone, The Droid Erisis an excellent android phone even with the 2.1 operating system. The Cameratakes extremely good pictures and the touch screen is easy to use. I love thatyou have 2 blank menu screens to set short-cuts to your favorite apps. It also hasdedicated screens for favorite contacts and to send text messages. Reception is greatalso. I was unhappy though when I found that you could not link apps to the sd card, buteven that wasn't a problem, after some research and a few tweeks I now have a Droid Eristhat I can put my apps on my sd card to free up space on the phone. I highly recommend thisphone to anyone who loves an android in a small package.",Very_Good

Does not have a built in screen protector but does have a rubber like piece on inside that hugs screen and comea with a screen proctecter that u put on after case so fits the space well kinda hard to out on like that tho,Very_Good
"Arrived in great shape, and at a great price. Included everything as if it were a new package. May I never have to deal with the junk that Apple pushes again.",Very_Good
"SAMSUNG did it again, the best telephone with robots inside.Yes, I highly recommend this phone over any other brand.",Very_Good
"So far it works perfectly. Battery life could be better, slim design is less important for me and probably for most people. Easy setup for dual SIM cards, you can choose freely which will use mobile data and assign contacts to SIMs. One SIM is micro the other is mini by the way. Might be difficult to use a micro SIM with an adapter in the mini SIM slot due to the design.",Very_Good
"Just what I needed to protect my new phone.Pros: Fits well. Looks good. Seems like it should offer a lot of protection. Belt clip seems very sturdyCons: It's big, on a big phone, so your phone is going to seem huge. The raised edge makes it slightly more difficult to use the fingerprint scanner, and swipe down at the top of the screen to see settings and notifications. The installation instructions could have been more clear.",Very_Good
"vivo en Venezuela, el equipo funciona perfecto,buen modelo de BB lo recomiendo, tiene buena camara, es super liviano, de verdad lo recomiendo. El unico detalle es que el telefono no tiene garantia y no trae tarjeta de memoria, pero se le puede comprar una y son bien economicas!",Very_Good

Been in use since I got it and it has yet to give me any problems!,Very_Good
"I am loving this phone. I wanted to switch network providers from Verizon to Cricket and so was in the market for a GSM unlocked phone. After a lot of research, I switched from my Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini to this phone and I am very pleased. The phone came in its original case and is definitely a brand new phone and not refurbished. Android 4.4.4 downloaded as soon as I booted the phone and set up was super easy through Motorola Migrate. Though some of my contacts did get a bit messed up and some of my apps did not migrate. I love the fact it's a relatively small phone so it fits in my pocket and I can use it with one hand. the interface is also really nice and, this being he developer edition, comes without all the clutter.",Very_Good
"Even with no SD card,, phone is great,,works perfect for me,,fast and easy to work with",Very_Good

"I have had this phone for 3-4 months and used it heavily since I got it. It is definetely a beautiful peace of hardware with Windows Phone inside.

"This was a replacement phone for my Droid X, but i like this one better. It has keyboard, is less of a brick, and is still touch screen. Only minus was the charger it was sent with did not work, but I used my Droid X charger. Battery life sucks on Droid's though...",Very_Good
could not say enough about the solid and almost perfect ability of this phone both physically and technically sound telecommunications equipment. my only downfall is that there was not any extension slot for this phone as far as memory and if you work this phone as hard as I do with aps and overloading it tends to over heat. couldn't imagine if I worked or lived in a hot environment.,Very_Good
"I really love my new Apple watch, it is everything that I expected, I am still in the process of learning about this product. I will definitely recommend this produce, being an apple lover.",Very_Good

"The phone arrived on time and well packed. The phone was in excellent condition, looks like brand new. All I had to do was take sim card out of old phone and place in new phone, turn it on and follow the on screen directions. So far it works great and cost less than the deductible was on Assurian insurance which I cancelled and realized it was useless. I highly recommend this phone.",Very_Good
"Brand new in the box, who could want more?? It's a classic and is bullet proof. Modern manufacturers could take a few notes, hell Blackberry could take a few!",Very_Good
"It's very fast and cheap, relatively, can run all the apps that I currently have with no problems. Yes, it's like a mini tablet with a phone function. However, I previously have a 5"" screen phone, a Nexus 7 tablet, and I found myself always carried both of them with me. So with the Z Ultra, I have one device that can be both, albeit as a phone, it isn't very pocketable.",Very_Good
All I can say is I'm pleased with this purchase. The shipping was alright too. I knew this was a great phone already. And the best part is that the internet just came on in by itself I didn't have to bother the APR or nothing. Data just flows. Overall just wonderful. Thank you,Very_Good
"This is a solid mid-range smartphone in the market. It takes a nano-SIM card and works with T-mobile 4G network. Overall, the latest android interface is intuitive and makes it easy to use. You will need to perform extra steps to customize the system but there are plenty of resources (youtube & sites) out there to provide you the info.I am somewhat a light user (making calls, email, and brief online browsing) and this full-charged phone lasts as least a day or two.",Very_Good
"excellent , similar to s4 very much like screen, the speed of the phone is very good at video games and the system in general , internal memory also very good , and compatible with most applications of the market, the most prominent is Mortal Kombat x it consumes enough resources and the runs this phone , compatible with networks in Venezuela , I am very satisfied with the telephone, after having had a s4 .",Very_Good

"its a good phone. I needed to get a new phone. so I found this one, only used 2 times. and its my baby. it may not be the lastest iPhone, but I love it.",Very_Good
Easily the best phone I've ever used. Great price point but even better performance and image quality of the screen and sound quality from speakers. Will stick with this phone for a while unless Alcatel can somehow find a way to out do the Idol 4s.,Very_Good
The phone is in a new condition and just like in the product description. Shopping with you is a pleasure.,Very_Good

"I like big. Screen is very bright and sharp. It has excellent battery life. It has very good sound and loud enough. If you read books like me, no doubt should go with this phone. No need to carry another tablet. This is 2 in 1. Love it!!",Very_Good
"I love this phone with a clear screen and good sound. It doesn't come stuffed with apps I don't use. I like that it takes a storage card. I can get through a day with it before needing to charge its battery most days. When I was traveling, and constantly using it for navigating, taking pictures, getting information about where I was and what I was seeing, I did need to plug it into an external battery pack by late afternoon. This phone does everything much more expensive phones do if you don't want or need VR. I hope Alcatel will continue to make elegant, simple phones like the Idol3.",Very_Good
"Have had this on my phone for nearly a year now & it still looks new. Phone has fallen out of my pocket, off counters & once even off my motorcycle. No evidence of these mishaps! Great product.",Very_Good
"My 15 year old son worked on the weekends to get this phone. And when he had his money saved up he was happy to purchased it. We could have bought it for him. But he insisted that he wanted to work for it. Legit iPhone, shipping was fast. We had no problem connecting it to T-Mobile. Really happy with the phone.",Very_Good
The guy who helped me in T-mobile told me he was thinking about getting one of these and then was amazed it was only about two hundred dollars. I had a previous model and love the camera upgrade on this one. It takes photos laser fast and it's always a joy to have a new fresh version of a much enjoyed tool. People are familiar with the Asus brand and the quality it supplies. I haven't been disappointed ever with this so have stayed constant with using this company's phones. Lots of style and versatility available in this one.,Very_Good
"I prefer using this phone over a touch screen. I don't have any problems with it. It has really good speakers. My only complaint is that I had to buy a new charger for the phone because the one that came with it didn't work. Overall, I thought it was a very good deal for a good phone.",Very_Good
Ordered from the Caribbean. no problems with the phone. it was exactly as pictured and I am very satisfied.,Very_Good
Very happy with this purchase ....however I need an extra charger and I am having trouble finding one on Amazon.,Very_Good

"I have had Samsungs and HTCs twice the price of this one, but it beats them all. It is very fast, has all the features you want, but none of the unnecessary battery-draining fluff the other manufacturers load their phones down with.",Very_Good
"Great phone. I took it overseas for a family member, it was unlocked and works great.",Very_Good
"I have always had very basic phones since I am not a big fan of electronics, however, I can now see the appeal. I have had my htc mytouch 3g for a couple of days and love it. It was brand new in the original box and I believe it came with everything but the extended battery, user manual and did not have a sd card. I had to go get the sd card and paid 30.00 for a 16gb. The screen is small but as a first time user and a person who does not use the internet very often or for work this is a very good starter phone and well worth the money I paid for it or better yet not paid for in a newer model. One other thing to mention my local T-Mobile shop guys were impressed with the packaging and overall value of the phone and what I paid for it but did mention it is an older model.",Very_Good
"Excellent phone, easy to use and very fast to open applications, the photos are expectaculares like the videos, the signal is very good and your operating system surprised me!!",Very_Good
"The phone came in exactly as described, if not better! It had no scratches, and if there was, I couldn't see it. I had it set up to T-mobile and it was super easy! She even gave me her old cases with no extra charge- which really helped! It's been about a month and I'm still content and happy with my purchase! Thank you!",Very_Good
"Great phone, still using it even though it isn't the newest model. Love the waterproof aspect. I'm able to mount it to my motorcycle, even in the rain",Very_Good
Its a relly nice phone I expected less for the price I just wish the battery was a little larger but for the price is good specially when the screen is not a big resolution I recomend this for first phone for a kid is really good,Very_Good
"Amazon had a great deal on this phone and after reading all the reviews, I had to have it. It replaced both my iPhone 6 and my Galaxy Note 4. Since it has two SIM Card Slots, I can use both my cell numbers and NOT have to carry around two phones. The feel of the phone is great. The speed is perfect.This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.",Very_Good
"Phone showed up on my door after 36 hours thanks to amazon. Phone is beautiful, huge screen, HD screen, fast processor, 13mp camera, call clarity is great, no problems with data or wifi. I would buy this for myself but I don't need one lol. My wife absolutely loves this phone!",Very_Good
"This was a really great phone for a few years, until the battery gave out.I intend on replacing the battery soon and continue using it. It is that good!Tech may be a little dated for some apps today.",Very_Good
"The phone is beautiful, super super fast, good screen, pure android and a good price. I definitely recommend it .",Very_Good
"The seller was very honest and up front about the phone. It was exactly as described. The package did not have earbuds, but the charging cord($19.99) needed replacement. However, that little issue is not enough to downgrade the seller's rating. The phone is awesome, and it has been verified by the Apple Store to be genuine, and I already have it up and it is teaching me the way to use ios 7. That auto update occurred the morning after I activated service. I have three different sim chips and all three work just fine in the unlocked phone. I had to use a chip cutter to make the chips fit, but that was very easy to accomplish. GREAT SELLER!!!",Very_Good
I really like the product. I've had it for more than a month now. It works great. I use TMobile services. I recommend.,Very_Good
I've just bought this phone and I wanna send it to Africa but the label is saying current AT&T customers.can it really work GSM?,Very_Good

This phone has been the perfect choice for me looked and looked and found this one got it on time had for a few months now and now it's starting to restart but I think it's just my phone case over heating it but other than that it's the best highly recommend this one has been great to me!,Very_Good
"I am absolutely in love with this phone!!! I was a little worried as other reviewers had talked about having trouble activating the phone. It was easy, I had to buy a sim activation kit for $10 and followed the instruction, NO PROBLEMS!!! YAY!!! I am so glad Tracfone finally got the BYOP program. <3",Very_Good
"What can I say, it is an Otter Case...they speak for themselves. Not my first one, and there is a reason for using them.",Very_Good
"Best phone I've ever had, still use it to this day without any issues so far!! Definitely recommend to those who want a phone with pen capabilities and overall awesomeness of Android! Have not even considered moving up to the Note 5 yet, 4 is perfect, and pink! _Ù÷",Very_Good
"When I first got the phone, everything seemed normal, but when I went to activate it, I couldn't because it was still registered to a prepaid account. I was very concerned because I thought I had been scammed. When I got home I sent an e-mail, and I received a response the same day. I was promptly mailed a new phone, and had it by the next week. I was extremely happy with the product, and the service. I would definitely buy from them again.",Very_Good
"This phone is amazing. It is fast, beautiful, and smart. It has all the bells and whistles. Well worth the money.*** If you are getting the international version in the US, please beware that this phone with not get 4G speeds. It will only get 2G. The branded US versions will get 4G speeds. ***I selected the unlocked international version for several reasons. First, I am not stuck with a single carrier for the life of the phone. Second, this version is not full of a bunch of silly, carrier-specific software. Third, it will work internationally if I travel with just the change of the SIM card. Lastly, it has an FM radio that is missing from the carrier-specific US models. This is my first smartphone, and I couldn't be more impressed. With the phone in easy mode, it is easy enough to learn, even for someone who is not especially skilled with technology. I love this phone and couldn't be happier with it!",Very_Good
I Love this phone! It is fast and reliable.a small SD Card and plenty of phone storage space are more than enough for me. The internet browser seems a little slow but really nothing terrible at all. I'm really enjoying it. Although even brand new it has a little over one days battery life. And that is after charging it and letting it die multiple times (that actually made a difference).. Great phone!,Very_Good

"If I woukd have stuck with Android this would have been my go to phone, but I went with the 6 Plus. Not because Apple is cooler or makes a better phone, but because of content. Better apps across the board. I create music and Apple has a much more music apps for iOS than android. If it weren't for that, I'd be with the Note 4.",Very_Good

"Let me first start with an apology to the e-seller: This phone is amazing! And I did not want you to think I was attempting to extort a sim card out of you, in exchange for a glowing review. ( I apologize for any misunderstanding, regarding your company's reputation or integrity).To anyone purchasing this device, A sim card is not included due to federal privacy laws.However If you purchase this device and you need a sim card, all you have to do is visit a corporate Verizon Wireless store. A sim card will be given to you and registered free of charge! The phone is AWESOME!! And the price was equally impressive! The only grievance I had was with the incompetent U.S. postal delivery confirmation system!!!! The dimwit U.S. postal employee who delivered this parcel, flagged it as delivered at 12pm?! Causing massive confusion and anguish!! The actual delivery time did not occur until 8pm that evening!! But I will definitely do business with this company going forward!",Very_Good

I have had mine for approximately a month and still having fun discovering new features. Blue Products has improved the quality so the complaints people had about prior phones has been resolved.

Hopefully Blu Products will start making accessories soon. Everybody's waiting Blue so get busy!!!!!",Very_Good
"When it came to my door you best believe I opened it faster than the rubiks cube wr. Great phone, quickcharge, earbuds, can play your ps4 on it without losing progress from the tv and loads more.

"This is solid little phone for someone who needs communications around the world but does not need full data functions. It sounds clear, has text messaging, does facebook and emails, albeit slowly. It also has an mp3 player and bluetooth. An unusual feature is the ability to receive analog TV service directly off the air, not via data service. In the USA, analog TV service no longer exists, but in other countries you'll be able to watch local television directly off the air, even if the cell phone service isn't active. It is also unlocked, so you can use it with any GSM serice like ATT, T-Mobile or H2O. It also works overseas with a second SIM card (it holds two at once). This is the perfect travel phone. If you lose it, it's under 20 bucks to replace it.",Very_Good

"My husband is a music freak and we text a lot to each other and we needed a basic phone for Verizon contract so we didn't have to be required to pay for an additional data plan( required if you buy ANY smart phone, and its $35 bucks). he has had the phone a couple weeks and he REALLY likes it. As far as the reviews on the battery, no problem there either. Reminder on what I stated earlier.....

"processing power has not gone up a lot from the original nexus 5 (my previous phone) but this new has a better build, battery life and the finger print security (which sounds useless but its actually nice to save you 3s per time you open your phone). 5 row apps in the main screen is also a improvement from the silly 4x4 previous.",Very_Good

"The product that you adquiricon, with specifications was what came to me.A thousand congratulations and keep well.Many Congratulations.",Very_Good
"This phone is awesome. Easy to hold - a nice weight & the back cover has a rubbery textured grip. My TMobile sim card & micro-SD card setup was seamless, as was the initial setup for the phone powering on & configuring. The battery is robust & lasts all day for me. Its speakers for music, notifications and ringtones are loud enough and easy to adjust. Intuitive settings & management of Android version 4.4.2 (which all my preferred mobile apps are compatible with). The only minor drawback would be the camera quality, but I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm so happy I got this phone; it's exactly what I was hoping for after going through all of this product's specs.",Very_Good
"Very happy with my otter case, would definitely tell friends and family to buy one.",Very_Good
"This phone is an absolute powerhouse in every single fathomable way... The screen is absolutely gorgeous, and produces some of the highest quality colors and depth I've seen in any device. The guts of the thing are insanely overpowered, and they are well utilized with a snappy interface. The camera takes ridiculously detailed pictures, and the flash (most often used as a flashlight) is super bright and seems to cover a wider area. The phone sticks to Samsung tradition and feels virtually indestructible.The only minor gripe I have with it is the fact that nobody can seem to make a good screen protector for it due to the edges being curved the way they are... A pity for some, but if you're careful you shouldn't ever need a screen protector anyway.If you're looking for a small form factor phone, get this one. The s6 edge plus would be my choice for a phablet.",Very_Good
Love my edge ! I have been using it since August 2015. Bought it for my self as an early birthday present. And yes I can use any carrier on this phone.,Very_Good
"At first I ordered the white one but with size of it it kinda felt and looked cheap, plus it was defective and had no problem returning the product, the black and silver one works great! and looks even better!",Very_Good
The case is doing a good job of protecting my phone in a machine shop environment.,Very_Good
"I bought a used Note 2 to replace my Lumia 1520 because I couldn't stand the fact that Microsoft was providing updates for the Android and iOS apps (Office, Skype, OneDrive) before supporting their own platform.It's a solid device, it runs pretty much everything I throw at it currently. I wound up installing Ditto Note 3 with the ANGI Kernel in order to help solve my only issue - battery life. it's abysmal and I was recharging before noon at my desk. The new kernel and a ZeroLemon 9300mah battery later, and I can go 20 hours and still be at 65%. Definitely worth dropping the extra $45 if you don't want to be tied to the wall all the time. DN3 is worth an install too - the Note 3 features like Air Command are great.I like touchwiz, it's come a loooong way from android 1.6 devices, and will be sticking with Galaxy Notes for the forseeable future.",Very_Good
The instructions from a previous buy to dial ##000000 to put your own # in the phone worked perfectly. The company was great in responding to and addressing my questions. Taking this phone to Trinidad and Tobago this week so hopefully all goes well.,Very_Good
"This is a very good phone, big memory, full keyboard, great camera, and a lot of little things extra, and low cost! what else do you want! The service is great, the phone is great, concerning the money paid for it, it's more than worth it!",Very_Good
I got my order on time without any issues and I love my phone. As of now it is working flawlessly and I am very pleased.,Very_Good
"I've had this phone for 5 months and have yet to have any problems with it. The battery is one of the best I've seen, lasting well throughout the day and night, and it's taken several drops and doesn't have a scratch. It's fast, the camera quality is nice, and the price is great for what you're getting. I've had a posh mobile before and no other phone can really compare, unless it's over 400 dollars.",Very_Good
"love it, Injoying it as much as i can i would recomen to any one",Very_Good
"Yeahhh, The Blackberry 9650 is another Blackberry i am not saying that is a bad phone. Well what can i say? I like blackberry and BBM to share all with my friends around the world, i updated the 9650 to OS6 without a problem and it works really fast and it has good aplications, camera 3.2mp flash etc, all new models has that. I really have this phone for work and bbm also with my work friends. Blackberry 9650 has all i need for work. I other ways the blackberry 9650 is a little heavy and need activation with a code Buy it on EBAY and it works is the only bad thin. Otherwise it is perfect",Very_Good
"That's exactly what I needed; a phone that works perfectly as a phone and does some extra functions as well, It's well made with very good material and durable construction. It's worth every dollar.The voice clarity is awesome, battery is fantastic I charge it every two or three days with average daily talk time of about 2 hours.perfect connection to my bluetooth headset, the exterior is well made and provide rugged look which I like very much",Very_Good
Amazing phone! Battery is truly amazing. I've bought 3 now and have been satisfied. Picture quality is amazing as well!,Very_Good
Product was as mentioned. I advise all to be sure to read the fine print. I skimmed over the portion stating this was not a Verizon phone and had to return it. Otherwise this product was exactly as described and works great.,Very_Good
Beautiful phone. Thought I could use micro sim but realized needed the whole sim card so fixed that and great phone,Very_Good
"We are most pleased with our purchase via Amazon. We obtained the phones at a nice discount from the price we had contemplated with a retailer. They arrived timely and in good shape. That's the Amazon review. Now as to the phones, I don't know how many stars to assign. We, especially (old guy) me are novices to smart phones, so we're starting the learning curve. But so far, so good. The phones seem to work every bit as well as advertised. That is to say, it'll do much more than we currently know how to do. A major plus has been that Samsung offers classes at a near-by Best Buy store with Samsung employees. That is 5-star service.",Very_Good
"Best phone ever. I have used iphone, Nexus, Blackberry and now Note 2.. This is a holy phone.PS: Not for small hands..",Very_Good
"Great functionality for the money. I use TracFone and had no troubles connecting to the service. Also, added the wireless charging back - very handy.",Very_Good
"This phone has ruined me in regards to battery life. I get up at 6am, play on it all day, and have 30%+ when I go to bed at 10.I have absolutely nothing to say bad, this is the best phone I've ever owned.",Very_Good
"This phone is fantastic. The one common criticism with which I cannot disagree, the case (back) is plastic and feels fragile and kinda cheap. Buy a decent wallet or case for $10 and you'll never notice that.",Very_Good
The phone is excellent. I have not been able to use most of the possibilities that this smart phone provides.,Very_Good
"I know everyone says that if they have an iphone but it's true. It's a great phone. I have my music, texting, and apps all in one place and i love it. the only problem is it dies too much",Very_Good
"I switched over from my blackberry which has a broken track pad, and this item is great for the price. It is fast and works without an issue, and for the lower price it does not disappoint. I have no other experience with an android phone, but I don't regret switching from blackberry to this phone in the slightest. If you want to spend less and still get a good product, I highly recommend this phone.",Very_Good
"Love the case, everything is perfect considering the price! The quality of the card holder flap is questionable, but I only intend to use it when I don't wish to use my purse, so I don't think the wear and tear will be too much. As for the mirror quality, it is not the best, but it is not faded and does not come with scratches all over it, that's a protective sheet that easily peels off. (I thought the same as the previous review, until I scratched it with my nail and it lifted up). Thanks for the product!",Very_Good
"I had this phone but ended up dropping it in a pool of water, so I had to get another one because it is so damn awesome! It's very fast and reliable, and the camera takes perfect pictures. You couldn't get a better cell phone in this price range in my opinion.",Very_Good
"The phone is great. It came unlocked, all I had to do was insert a sim. It is a little small, but I knew the specs before I purchased it. I am little disappointed that I am unable to block unwanted numbers and texts, but I will get over it or change the phone.",Very_Good
"I have no problems with mine, I got mines from brownbox bonanza and it seems legit; though it didn't come with any spare s pen nibs which i thought was weird. Other than that this phone is great. Im guessing this is a european model since the plug consists of two rods and the temperature is displayed in celcius instead of fahrenheit and i cannot seem to change it. I have a tmobile sim card in and it works just fine in murica.",Very_Good
This was a used phone however it seems to work very well haven't had any problems with it. I really like it.,Very_Good
"It's an iPhone, what can I say. though is a 3GS, it has the latest iOS installed. updates everything. Everything works perfect. Only thing is you have no siri or facetime or can't install some games.",Very_Good
Bought this for the better half. She had an LG phone that was at its end of life. She loves this phone. It is much faster than her old phone and the touch display is much more responsive than her old phone. This is a refurbished phone but looked brand new. So far she is very satisfied with this phone.,Very_Good
"Awesome phone it is. For 35 bucks, it is a killer. Super fast phone! Must buy as a gift!",Very_Good
"El celular me llego en perfectas condiciones. Soy de Argentina y me anda para cualquier empresa (movistar, claro y personal), anda bien, ninguna queja!!",Very_Good
Great Price!!!! I absolutely love this phone. It's much better than the blackberry's of old. I really think it's the best one yet (I haven't tried the priv). Blackberry still has work to do in terms of ease of use and compatibility but I love this phone.,Very_Good
Love the phone. Its is fast not too huge and has a really good camera.,Very_Good
Got this for my bestfriend's mom. She's not a phone fanatic. She just wanted a phone to make calls and text. She told me not to pass 50us in getting her a simple phone. So far so good.,Very_Good
"It's a fun phone, cost $101 to get a sim card (smart phone first-time user), and I was not aware it would be that much, but it is worth it.",Very_Good
Unfortunately I bought this off a third party seller. He never sent it. My review is on another galaxy note 4 that I purchased. The phone is awesome. No regrets. With that said. I love my samsung s5 better. But the screen on the note 4 is unbeatable.,Very_Good
Even though it's used it still works like I bought it new. Will probably buy used again,Very_Good
This is a great phone came looking brand new runs awesome I am in love with my note 3. 32GB of memory built in plus my 64GB memory card has crappy ton of apps and music space love it.,Very_Good
"Amazing phone, love that is is a mix of Android and iPhone. Best Android I have owned yet!!",Very_Good
Just like the phone that had died and which I liked so much. I am so happy to have a duplicate of that phone.,Very_Good

"Great battery life. Easy to use. This is a great phone and radio. Don't expect to take pics, videos, etc....I was away for two weeks with hardly any power. I was able to use the phone, make numerous calls, without charging.",Very_Good
"Best smartphone i ever had, period. I'm just waiting for the 2015 model without any regrets",Very_Good
Bought the phone for my husband. Came quicker than I expected and in great condition. Works great,Very_Good
"it is great, both the phone and Amazon's service, thank you! Very good experience with Amazon!",Very_Good
"I am very pleased with this smartphone. This will be my 3rd or 4th BB and it is great! My only complaint is that when text messaging, if I run my finger over the wrong spot it somehow switches to something else. It can be sensitive. Other than that, I love it. Also, I was very skeptical because it does not say which provider it is compatible with, but after doing research, I learned that it works with my provider....just slip in the sim card. Keep in mind, it takes a ""micro sim card,"" so make sure that you have one if ordering this phone. After I received the phone I realized this and AT&T sent me one and got it in just a couple of days.",Very_Good
This is An amazing phone for a good price get it hands down.I like the fingerprint id a lot.The screen is big and good features and snappy performance,Very_Good
"Although a fun of Samsung Galaxy, I initially did not want to buy this because I already had the S2. Hey that was wrong, Note 2 is simply amazing. Does all the stuff you need in a phone",Very_Good
"Phone works great, Seller reported slight wear, and there is, if you look closely. I'm very happy with my purchase.",Very_Good
"I have heard a lot about Iphones and have always wanted one but always found the current generation kinda pricey. I bought this as as my trial Iphone and after I charged it up and did some basic settings, I saw why Iphone adherents rave about them. I'm impressed and am already looking to buy a 4G..",Very_Good
I've been having a blast with this phone. there are tons of games and apps for it and it has PNP update software. the screen is crisp and bright. and touch sensitivity is great. just love this phone.,Very_Good
"Excellent buy. Of course the battery life is similar to those of other smartphones. But putting two sim chips in Lima was a breeze, the phone recognized them easily and was able to receive and make calls inmediately. This phone is unlocked, FYI.",Very_Good
"I purchased an iPhone 6 Plus,it came on time and was virtually spotless.I am very happy with this purchase",Very_Good
"Lightweight and fast with good features, excellent screen. Best cell phone I've owned so far.",Very_Good
"i love this phone so much, so i bought it again :). i originally bought one from Verizon when it was released, however after almost 2 years and many many drops i finally shattered the back screen. With knock off parts out there i opted to just buy a brand new one. I love this device, considering the PS4 mirror, water proofing, long battery, FM radio tuner and quick charge features its hard to beat. With a recent update from Verizon you now got dual band going, voice and data at same time. I hate iPhone so much especially when theirs way better devices like this around.",Very_Good
Some refurbished phones don't come with a new battery...this one obviously did cause it runs for 3 days without a charge. it has not malfunctioned since i got it 2 months ago and i did get a silicone/hard plastic combo case that saved it twice. great buyI don't need to fall for the phone of the month hype... and make iphone richer just give me one the works well..,Very_Good
I have always love this phone i would say to get this phone it has never failed me. i love it,Very_Good

"the phone is very responsive, and easy to setup to my preferences, good device. and recommended Seller",Very_Good
"I bought this phone for my mom who is 65 years Just needed a simple phone without all the bells and whistles. Just for text and calls but it has some other great features. It's also very cheap and it works more than all the crap at the same price. My mom loves the phone. One caveat, the call quality can be a little better but it works. Also, it arrived blazingly fast! Would buy again...",Very_Good
Very good phone very fast my wife loves the pink color ...The seller shipped the phone very fast with no problems the phone was perfect. I highly recommend this phone to anyone .......,Very_Good
The Otterbox clips last so much longer then the other brands. My husband has gone through at least 10 of the other ones. This clip has a better quality. Very pleased.,Very_Good
this phone was for my husband and he still uses it.he loved the fact it was kinda large but not too large that it was hard to get in and out his pockets.great phone,Very_Good
I purchased this phone for my mom. She is older and prefers a flip phone that is easy to use. The sound quality is wonderful and she has been able to use it right from the box with very little problem. I highly recommend.,Very_Good
"Phone works really well, didn't expect that since I had never had a blu phone before. But overall i'm very happy with the product",Very_Good
"It works great here in Chile. Updated tu ICS via OTA the same, international version works great.Recommended purchase at all time.",Very_Good
Upgraded from a Q10 and this is a huge improvement. The screen size makes a big difference and the phone feels good in your hands.,Very_Good
"This phone has a nice large screen, camera is good, speaker is phenomenal. The phone is pretty (not important but still worth mentioning). It comes with a protective case that is color coordinated to the phone. It comes with a screen protector. This phone is absolutely wonderful especially for the low price. I would definitely recommend this phone, and am considering buying another as I bought this for my daughter. If you are budget minded and want a nice phone for a pay as you go or no contract plan this is the ticket!!!",Very_Good

"I got this phone as a replacement for my iphone 5. I love apple products, but I decided to give samsung a chance. The phone has impressed me, and now I think apple is staying behind compared to the new samsung phones. The phone is fast, battery life can last all day if you're a medium user. Camera is good overall. I really don't have any complaints about this phone. I think apple (for me) is something of the past. I would highly recommend buying this phone.",Very_Good
"For those wondering, this does fit the gt-n8013ea, galaxy note 10.1 2013 version. I have always had an otterbox for my phone's and this one does not disappoint. It fits like a glove and well worth it to protect your investment",Very_Good
"I was able to lower my monthly subscription cost. Service in this area is not as good as Sprint. Lots of dead spots up north in Michigan. Combined, the wife and I, we save about $ 25.00 per month with a $650.00 investment. Not sure it is the correct way to go. Would be better if I could take advantage of the 4 more phones permitted on my contract. The Wife went onto the Daughters contract. She filled it up as number 5. I'm all alone on my account. I now get all the bells and whistles, but really all I wanted was a phone that Talked and Listened.",Very_Good
I love this phone for the price!! it took a long time to find a 32gb built in memory unlocked that wasn't an iphone or galaxy. The ear speaker is slightly quite sometimes but i think simetimes it has to do wth the other end of the call. maybe i'm just use to having my old phone up too loud lol,Very_Good
"Amazing product. Never knew how amazingly convenient having and extra battery is. It's pocket size and you can take with you. Now?mind you, you do obviously need a charger to charge the battery pack charger. It does not run on batterys. I have the Fast Charge Travel Adapter. (The original charger that comes with the phone) bought it here in Amazon for $9.99 it works amazingly. But, I don't even plug my phone into the charger anymore! It's so mind blowing to me how I've never had one of these before! I totally recommend it. This is the real product sold by LG. you can even go on there website and look for yourself. It even comes in the original retail box that it is sold in from stores or from LG. This product is amazing, very high quality. Put it this way, the battery case that it goes you ( you can store your battery in there it's a little plastic flip open case, pocket size) has the LG logo on it and so does the Battery pack charger! This is not an aftermarket brand product. This is LG's product.",Very_Good
"This Smartphone is a marvel! I have since September 2013 and so far no complaints, on the contrary, I am surprised and admired by all I can do with the ... hurts millions of people do not know about this new OS 10.

"This phone does everything Iphone's/Pre's/Storms offer and more (from a functional perspective). It probably requires a bit more tech savy than the other mentions, but once set up everything works smoothly. I got IMAP emails from the office, Exchange calendering, GMAIL, Internet radio, VOIP to work perfectly - over wi-fi when @ home, or GPRS when on the road.An excellent buy - highly recommended for the more technically inclined.",Very_Good

"great phone, but mine was defective- both screens had issues - the seller promptly offered a replacement but I had already ordered a refurbished phone figuring that having it checked out was important. This is my first qwerty keyboard phone, since we just switched plans to unlimited texting, I am now finally texting. I love using this phone, while it's heavier and bulkier than my last favorite phone - the Mororola KRZR, which I had to give up - not because it broke - it was a touhg little phone - but because when Verizon stopped supporting it, it would take 10-15 minutes to reboot. I replaced it with an Exalt, which is an ok phone, but the ENV3 is great for those of us who do not need to be on the net all the time. the Keys have a positive feel when pressed and I learned how to import free ringtones. Software is more user friendly than the Exalt. Super easy to activate.",Very_Good

"I really like this phone so far. This is my first smartphone, and I'm using in the Consumer Cellular network. The phone feels substantial, durable, and not cheap or flimsy at all. The screen resolution is great, and the colors are vibrant. It's intuitive and easy to use. I like that it came with a lot of useful things like screen protector, power USB cord, silicone case, etc. Overall I am happy with my purchase and will look at purchasing another BLU phone in the future if needed. For the money I'm happy.",Very_Good
Thank you so much. Fast and works perfect. If I didn't fid that I don't think I would have gotten another iPhone,Very_Good

LOVE this phone. Best phone experience I've had outside of the ease of the Appstore and OS from Apple. Camera literally blows me away. Love this phone. Brown leather back gives real premium look. Arrived on time. Works great. Cricket service is perfect on this.,Very_Good
"This was a replacement for my Nexus 5 that started having some issues. I loved my Nexus 5 and knew that if I had to replace it, this would be it! I have been so happy with this phone and love the improved features, faster processor, better camera, button design, and larger screen. The finger print sensor on the back I did not think would be that useful, however, it has been one of my favorite features of the phone! You can just touch the sensor to turn on the phone with no other input. Also useful for payment without putting in a password in the Google Play store. It is definitely faster than my old Nexus, and the 32 gigs compared to my old 16 makes a huge difference for music and apps. The Nexus has a pure Android OS, so you don't have all of the bloatware that comes on most other phones. Plus, they are the first devices to be updated for new Google apps or a new OS (ie. Nougat) I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone in the market for an awesome unlocked phone.",Very_Good

"I got this phone and was really pleased with the overall fit, finish, and feel. It was sleek and not overly flashy. The screen was bright and crystal clear. I did alot of research on T-mobile and coverage areas. On the map, I was covered, and 100% covered by 4G, so I was excited to try it out. I got the phone overnighted from amazon and got it all set up and nothing... No signal and the phone stayed in ""Edge"" data, but couldn't even get on the internet. I could make calls, but not recieve them. I called T-mobile and they said everything was fine, and made a test call, which came through. That was the only call that ever made it through... EVER! So, sadly, the phone went back, and I stayed with Sprint.",Very_Good
"I wrote the seller and they sent me an attachment that sent me to a YouTube video to watch. When I got the unit the closest instructions on it to English, was Italian. The power supply that came with one is an international one with a USA adaptor. It was perfect for me because it was going to a friend in another country. But if want it for the US, it would work but be a little cumbersome.",Very_Good

"So I recently purchased this phone from the seller Breed, and had it shipped by Amazon and I must say, I was pretty nervous about it because of all the bad reviews about getting the wrong phone and stuff. But I got my phone, it was brand new! and I'm really loving it! It's sleek, and the camera quality is unbelievably awesome! The quad-core makes this phone really easy to use and doesn't slow up. This phone was definitely a great purchase!",Very_Good
The product arrived sealed before the maximum due date*****. It worked instantly on my home wi-fi after typing in the code*****. Works great on wi-fi but just a bit slower compared to my Galaxy S3; I didn't expect the phone to be just as fast anyway. I was delighted it included a USA electrical plug in adaptor*****. I'll update my review as necessary when I insert a SIM card.,Very_Good
"I dropped my phone off a 3 story balcony and it wasn't scratched or damaged at all. It is also has an internal case protecting it from water damage but not 100% protection of course. You will notice, however, that the end product is much thicker than the iPhone. This is to be expected and is not a problem. It fits in my pocket and phone holder just fine.",Very_Good
"The product was beautiful, but the problem is that i live in Europe, and didn't know about the sprint restriction. so kinda failed there. The phone is sleek, sturdy and beautifully made. Its fast and one of the nicest phones i have seen out there. if your tired of your iphone and want something that works buy this one. Only in America ;)",Very_Good
"I ordered the Nokia 6350 flip phone refurbished from Amazon in October 2015. I hated damn phone cuz it overheated, it went dead fast, I could barely hear people when I was talkin on the phone which pissed me off. I also had bought another phone from Amazon on January 1 2014 and the phone was defective and didn't work. I will never order a phone from Amazon again cuz it pissed off dat the phones don't work and I had to mail my phones back which is a inconvenience.",Very_Good
"Every thing as expected. I Really like the phone's functions and the battery lasts for more than a day without needing a recharge. Great keyboard. Although it runs Android apps., it doesn't run all of them, but so far haven't missed any because up until now the equivalent BB apps.have outperformed the Android versions.",Very_Good
"My Children are always using my tablet and my computer, which I also use for work. I wanted to get them a small tablet for the car, but I needed it to be able to give them whatever shows they want at whatever time. When I saw the Posh Memo and knew I could put a prepaid sim card into it and the kids could have everything they wanted at the touch of a button, even in the car - I was sold. Posh; thank you - and my kids thank you. With the double earjack I bought, they can both watch and listen while I drive in peace and quiet.",Very_Good
"Only had this phone a few days now it arrived quick and the phone is fast hooked up to my wifi with no problem, we had an iphone five and we were able to activate this one by switching the two without going into the store. A piece of cake for my son, so far it's a great buy looks good no added contrac time,real nice phone.",Very_Good
"I just recieved my BRAND NEW Blackberry Torch. All buttons in tact, screen perfect, camera is AMAZING. Honestly I think it's a bit better than my Galaxy mini camera. The only thing I don't like about it is that it takes a standard SIM card, but I have no problem going to AT&T nd switching from a Micro to a Standard. :) all in all, this phone was an excellent buy.",Very_Good
I absolutely love the phone the product is exactly as was described. It is a very light and slim handset which suits me just fine and the picture quality is absolutely perfect. My only drawback was that the handbooks are all written in Spanish and I live on an English speaking island. But besides that I am pleased with the service I received.,Very_Good
So far the best phone I ever had. My previous phone was a Note 2.,Very_Good
"I am really happy with this phone. Great color, lots of great features and I had no issues switching it to my Cosmote number in Greece other than needing the micro sim card. Only CONS is bad quality taking selfies with the front screen camera, not great night pictures using the normal camera and the internal memory fills up fast.",Very_Good
"I love this phone!! Actually my SONY XPERIA broke and I thought that was such a beautiful phone, but this one I love just as much. I don't usually write reviews but I scoured reviews when my phone broke trying to find one with the best reviews. I know I have only had it for a few days so I can't comment on long term reliability but the screen is gorgeous, camera is great, it is fast and the colors are bright. White color reminds me of an iphone. Screen is big, not too big, and very comfortable to use. I just do facebook, snapchat, and email and social networking (instagram etc).I can't comment on its speed playing games or anything becuase I don't usually play games on my phone. Youtube videos look perfect, speaker us loud, camera is pretty. For the price this phone is amazing! My sony cost me 400 dollars USED!and its unlocked - awesome!",Very_Good
Thanks for your attention besides the satifaccion me with you when you purchase a good product and a very affordable price really lucky and am grateful that I continue the successes ....,Very_Good

"I bought this refurbished, and you could never tell that it wasn't brand new. Saved a couple bucks, and made the kid happy for his birthday! He had so much fun with the Apple Watch , that I went the next weekend and bought myself one...hence all the reviews about the watch bands I have posted. :)",Very_Good
i got the iphone 4s 32gb i was expecting some scratches or something but it looks like new. very pleased an a good price when i bought it.,Very_Good
"I got this phone for my daughter to replace her 2G phone because ATT is deactivating the 2G towers. So far it is working great. Reception and sound are good, and it holds a lot of phone #s. It takes decent pictures. It is sturdy. We are not a ""techy""family so this suits her needs. I resent being pushed into paying high monthly bills for a smart phone, as they keep making the ""dumb phones"" with less features. It's getting hard to find a non-touch, full qwerty ""dumb"" phone with a camera. Get this one while you still can.",Very_Good
"Buena compra de este telefono, este modelo es muy bueno, garn capacidad de procesamiento y memoria, muy fluodo en el manejo, sistema operativo robusto.",Very_Good
"I was amazed at how good of condition this phone was actually in, and it was a great price. I actually work for Target Mobile and sell phones, and I got more than I expected. I searched for almost a whole month for a good deal to make me push the confirm payment button. I definitely do not regret getting it.",Very_Good
This phone is a great value and works or as well as any more expensive phone that I have owned in the past.,Very_Good
"Came early in excellent condition. Even though the post office crushed in the box, the phone was packed well and was in perfect condition. You cannot tell the phone is used at all. It worked perfectly, though the charger is not as good as ones I already own. SIM from T-Mobile worked (you have to turn it off and on). Simple to put in (I used an earring wire) the SIM, and viola, it works. I like the Windows phone compared to my LG G3, though if you are heavy on apps, you may not. The resolution is good. The call quality is good with or without blue tooth (which it has, of course). The sound is excellent. I should have bought this first and saved a whole lot of money.",Very_Good
Phone works great and paid less then going through Verizon. I activated it on line with no problem,Very_Good
"I bought it for my personal use, has a good camera for photos and a good description, I like the size and design is perfect.",Very_Good

Fast windows with excellent camera. Looks beautiful. But windows is still to evolve. I hope they will come up with better app store soon and more customizable options soon.,Very_Good
"I bought this phone to replace another Motorola my dad had. He says he really likes this phone because of the simple design. His last phone was mp3 enabled and had a lot of side buttons that constantly were pushed when in his holster, but he does not have that problem with this phone. In a world of smartphones, it is getting more difficult to find simple flip phones like these. I also loved that it shipped quickly with Amazon prime. We needed this phone ASAP and it came just in time!",Very_Good
"Just recieved the phone 2 days ago, but so far its great. Exactly like a new phone. Even came with a SIM card for verizon. I was a little leary of ordering it but phone is from amazon/samsung and has 1 year warranty. Def glad i got it here and saved $200 over a new one from verizon.",Very_Good

i have been using milestone for almost 2 months in usa with t-mobile.i just get EDGE internet speed but it enough for me.i used to have nokia n900 but i returned it bacause of no portrait mode and hard to use like a cell phone.This phone is perfect slim and light.you can use all google features with this phone.phone calls easy and has a detail call log.after the new firmware update its better.gps reception is perfect.battery is enough for all day.it has nice accessories.and I really appreciate shopping with AMAZON never let me down i strongly reccommend this phone and AMAZON.,Very_Good

I bought this phone for my son because he wanted a touch screen but not a smart phone. I was amazed at how fast I received it and it was so easy to set up. My son just loves this phone. He can't put it down.,Very_Good
I ordered this phone in December and decided to wait 3 months before writing a review. I agree with other users that the manual does not give much information but the phone itself is pretty straight forward and easy to navigate. It takes quality pictures and the quality and clarity of the sound is good. The features are great and the battery lie any other smart phone will last based on your usage of the device. I am pleased with my purchase and will definitely look at this brand first for future purchase,Very_Good
"I love my new phone. previously I had the Evo 3d and this one is hands down sooo much better. and best pat it can make international calls, unlike the 3d,",Very_Good
"I have had a couple of these phones. I love the performance and value. The continued support of updates from google is really nice. Beats buying a phone that ends up with a outdated OS in 6 months. The phone will work on GSM and CDMA networks, however I have found out that only phones bought through google or sprint will work cdma with TING. So the Tmobile version of this phone activated on their GSM network no problem.",Very_Good
"I bought this phone to get me through the last few months of my current contract because my 18 month old IPhone won't hold a charge more than a couple of hrs. I am talking several hrs per day on this phone and battery life was 6 full days on the 1st charge and I'm going on 7 days on the 2nd. That being said, if u txt mess at all this is NOT the phone u want. I miss my smart phone so come August I will get one again but for an inexpensive ""dumb"" phone, I'll give it 2 thumbs up!",Very_Good
Amazing experience. This Samsung Galaxy S5 (for Tmobile) is virtually brand new. Absolutely no signs of previous use or even any refurbish activity. I would highly recommend this seller!,Very_Good
"Great phone and fast shipping. Its great cheaper iPhone alternative, works just like it but android.",Very_Good
"I still like the Env2 despite it being an ""old"" phone. I got a refurbished one after all and it seems to be working well.",Very_Good
I love my Pre2. Phone works great. I prefer the qwerty keyboard. I'll keep buying these and hold on to the last vestiges of Palm as long as I can. Guess I'll have to go android when my phone finally gives up the ghost because I loathe the overpriced apply products.,Very_Good
This is a very fast phone i love it alot and yes i did get the 4G lte model SM-G900F it is 100% original stuff from samsung so u guys can go ahead and order if you want. It came with a uk adapter but you get a converter to change the pins back to US standards.,Very_Good
Perfect for my tablet. The tablet is well protected. But made the tablet a bit bulky.,Very_Good
It is great. I love it. I will be ordering a 5.5 blu phone in a few days,Very_Good
My hubby is dangerous on cell phones. He drops then ask the time in water in dirt pretty probably even in the toilet....Lol this phone is durable and small enough fir his pocket he loves it.,Very_Good
"I was a little worry, but it arrived new and is working fine since I got it. Very nice phone especially the camera. You cannot get any better. I like the iphone better for business (mine) since it has the important apps needed for work i.e. logmein, and security camera (on certain brand). Now, I know why people complaint about not enough apps. There are a lot of them out there already but the important ones that Window phone need to pay attention to.",Very_Good
"Great phone. Nice display, nice sound quality, good camera. Thanks _Ù÷Û Only Downside Is That The Battery Life Isn't The Best But Other Than That It's Awesome",Very_Good

"Its Nokia - enough said! dropped it hundreds of times, hard as a brick! easy to use!",Very_Good
"This is a fine phone. But I had to return it to the vendor. It was used (which I knew before buying). However, the asking price was too great for the amount of wear and tear the previous owner(s) had done to the unit.The company was great shipping was fast and I had no problems with the returns and refund",Very_Good
"Does what it says and reliably so. I still use extra protection measures despite the advertised ""ruggedness"" because I am tough on anything I carry with me.",Very_Good
This phone is the beez neeze. Love it. Almost looks new. Price was good too,Very_Good
"It has an awesome display, excellent battery life and a nice performance.Pros:-Excellent build quality.-Clear, bright, with nice blacks screen.-Awesome software performance.-With apps like Camera360 the camera really stands out.-Front flash works nice.-The fingerprint reader is REALLY fast.-Dual-Sim-Expandable Storage-Quick charging, well, quickly charge the phone.Cons:-Because of the Full HD screen, 3d gaming is not good, I mean games like Asphalt 8 will run at around 25fps in low settings. But its fine for a 200$ smartphone :DOverall I'm pleased with the phone and I highly recommend it.Overall I really like it and I highly recommend it-",Very_Good
"I bought it for my 14 years old, great condition exactly as describedI'll always use the seller and recommend to all my friends, great price and fast shipperThank you",Very_Good
"This phone has everything I need and more. I truly appreciate the ASUS apps that keep it clean and fast.The camera is excellent and with features far better than i expected. This phone scores just a notch lower in some benchmark tests than those expensive monsters by iPhone and Samsung. Now look at the price, it is less than 1/3 of those, and it all makes sense.To me this phone is a CHAMPION; is is not just good, it is GREAT.Just add an optional memory card for your video , music and photo files and go !My advice to you is: give this one a good look before throwing your money at those overpriced phones in the SMART category.Kudos to the ASUS team that made a true winner.",Very_Good
"Excellent sending , and the product meets all my ofview , I recommend it 100%",Very_Good
"This phone work well, the second one I order. I gave one as a gift, can do more thing then I image. Glad I've upgraded to this model. Will recommend this phone to all my friends.",Very_Good
"Got this for connection to T-mobile's service using a T-Mobile Complete SIM starter kit (also from Amazon). My wife needed a small phone that wouldn't be obtrusive in the pocket. I love the fact that one can get at the ""guts"" of Samsung's phones so easily. No nonsense and no issues getting the phone registered.",Very_Good
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",Very_Good
Love it. Exynos processor is much faster than us versionAlso I travel a lot to Mexico so be able to switch SIM cards is awesome,Very_Good

"Purchased from Mango Wireless. The phone arrived just as described brand new and un-used.The actual phone is very solid if you are looking to purchase a phone that DOES NOT REQUIRE A DATA PACKAGE.Pros:Good battery LifeSurprising responsive ScreenSolid build quality (the keyboard mechanism feels great)Decent CameraPrice and ValueCons:AT&T Bloatwarelimited on board memory (purchase microSD card to fix this)no wifiOverall I recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a basic feature phone with some smartphone functionality, but does not want to pay for a data package although you certainly can. I currently also own an iPhone 5s and I could see myself using this phone for a good amount of time if anything should happen to my iPhone. It would be a great filler phone. Don't let AT&T sucker you into their NEXT program. Those are not real upgrades and you will pay a hefty price to get on those plans, but that's a different review for a different time.",Very_Good
"It's the best phone in market nowadays, I'm not yet using 4G, but I'll be ready, the best CPU, GPU, RAM size, screen size and definition. It is a so beautiful phone, that I would rather use it without a case, but the case is a must in my job.",Very_Good

There wasn't a scratch on it and it looks and works like new. And it even came with the free case as promised. The delivery was speedy. In fact the package arrived lot quicker than I expected.

"Bought this phone because I just couldn't get the speed I needed out of an otherwise really nice android phone.

"When a friend of mine asked why I didn't have a smartphone, I was embarrassed to tell her it was because I couldn't afford one. She realized my issue and suggested that I look on the internet. I saw some reviews of Posh phones and saw the all phone in my price range. I chose the Posh Mobile S580 Memo as it was my 1st choice. I was skeptical about the brand, but it had some good reviews; so I entered my order with my credit card and 3 days later my new Posh Phone arrived. I now can Skype with my family overseas in the military as well as email my friends and family all my photos and videos.

"PSA: the thing that comes in the SIM card slot IS NOT DISPOSABLE.The build quality is superb. I really like the waterproof feature. I have sweaty hands, which was problematic on my last smartphone (and is problematic on touch screens, in general). However, this phone's touch screen seems to work just as well when my hands are wet, as it does when they are dry. This is my favorite feature, so far.In my excitement, I skipped out on reading the included materials, and put a bunch of stuff in the trash. Try not to do this. I almost threw away the SIM card holder, thinking it was some kind of ""placeholder"". Again, the thing in the SIM card slot IS NOT DISPOSABLE.I'm using this phone with Ting, on their GSM network. Getting it set up was easy.",Very_Good

"I received the phone in perfect condition and I have been using it for over a month now. I absolutely love the phone. The look and feel of the phone is way above its class. People are always complimenting me and asking me about what kind of phone it is and how much I paid for it. The gold is mellow and not gaudy, it has a rose gold like color and looks very classy. The call quality and signal reception is very good. I consider myself as a moderate user and it handles most apps very well, in fact the performance is quite snappy so far. The battery is good too, lasts well over 24 hours. Overall very happy with my purchase. If there was was one complaint I had, it would be about the quality of the camera, the picture quality is average at best. I do realize this is a budget phone and I don't mind it, but in case the quality of the camera is important to someone, this might be something to consider before buying the phone.",Very_Good

Arrived faster than expected!

Unfortunately, I had it stolen from me on the bus near downtown San Diego. I later upgraded to the international Pearl White s7 Edge and I love it just as much as I loved this phone. I would recommend either or if you were interested in the Edge style phones!",Very_Good
The best phone on the market. Totaly worth it! I just love it! Good job HTC!,Very_Good

It looks just like a new phone. i am very pleased with my purchase I will definitely deal with them again.,Very_Good
"Excellent phone; it's really unlocked; you can use whatever sim card on itWhen I turn it on for the first time I had few issues (can't download apps, can't copy and paste text ...), but all problems disappeared once I upgraded the Windows OS from 7 to 7.5 (this required installing Zune 4.8 on my computer, then checking for updates). The upgrade took around 1 hour (for 3 downloads).",Very_Good

"One of the best mobiles i have used so far.The phone looks pretty good in your hand ,touch screen is very good and impressive.It is very pleasant feeling to hold the phone in your hand and its design is very good.The only problem i see is the way power button is kept.Bit difficult to use it without changing your grips.And also it comes with lot of pre-installed apps of which 2/3 rd of them will be of no use for most people.Overall i would say this is a good phone worth buying.",Very_Good

"It's a camera with a smartphone on the back, it's that simple. There's no way you can be mislead about this device. I've owned it for a few months now and I'm still really surprised at the negative feedback. ""It's bulky"" boasts the note3 enthusiasts. What a joke. This is really the best device I've bought in years. It's straight forward and that's what I like about it. The size and weight make it much easier to use than most phones I see today. A case is essential and in that aspect there aren't many choices but as far as the device goes don't let any tech-head steer you away. If you like photography this is the phone for you!",Very_Good
"It's a very good, well-rounded phone. It's Google VR compatible, you can use AR in Pokemon GO, and the durability is great. But I would advise you not to upgrade to the latest firmware update. It REALLY messes up the display. If you did, and the screen is glitching, I would recommend that you buy a new LCD. Overall, the phone is great, and nothing beats it.",Very_Good
"The phone itself, great condition, price, and quality. There was a lengthy process of contacting Verizion to have the phone operating correctly; however, I am pleased with the overall purchase.",Very_Good

"For a buck and change this is a very nice phone. It's done everything I want it to; make calls, text, retrieve emails, check the web and weather, take voice/video notes, wake me up in the morning and play my beats.

Great phone. Went from a Windows 6.9 phone to a Widows 7 and now this Windows 8. It is a RM-821 International Version. Some are AT&T Versions. I heard rumors that the AT&T Versions don't work well on T-Mobile. I didn't want to chance it so I got the RM-821. I received it and setup most of my stuff on Wifi. I also updated the system on Wifi. The next day I went to my local T-Mobile and picked up a micro-sim for the phone since my old phone had a full sized sim. Works very well. I get 4G and H+ in my area. So far so good. Love my Windows Phone!Tidbit: ZDNet had an article the other day about 150 of the fastest downloading phones. This phone came in 4th which is very good.,Very_Good

"This phone is the best. Now that I am using this, the thought of going back to iPhone is not a good one. It is big and houses so many apps. I have dropped and destroyed 4 iPhones in the past four years. I have dropped this phone several times and not a scratch on it!!",Very_Good

"I love this phone. I ordered it from The OEM Shop. Why do they have bad reviews? The phone came new, it came with the USB Cord, Headphones and the charger. :D It's so cute! It's rose pink. :DThe only problem I have is that the headset only has one earphone on it, not two. That's kind of weird but I have a headphone from the Gravity 2 so I could use that one.I love this phone! :D----Update 3/17/2012I've dropped it a lot but it works great still. I haven't had problems with it. This phone is just a replacement of my Gravity 2 that broke in late August. But at the end of this month I'm buying an HTC Sensation so this phone will be a back up for that phone.",Very_Good

"The phone came in exactly as described (it is shipped from CA). International stock (so no instruction manual in English) and with a European plug (seller included a converter to US - thanks for being thoughtful!). The phone is perfect and was easy to set up - really not much difference to a US bought one. My old Z2 had a regular SIM card slot, so I actually had to make a trip to ATT store to get a Micro one for this phone (it's free), but everything was smooth and quick and the phone works just fine. Thanks!",Very_Good

Although it does not take as quick pictures as an Samsung phone, they are of great quality. The HTC boomsound Audio is pretty loud and clear. Has a lot of features and currently has the Marshmallow update (does not c o m e with Marshmallow OS). I",Very_Good
We bought two of these around a month ago and they are great. Very easy to use and convenient. Well worth the price.,Very_Good
"I am very pleased with this phone. Exactly as advertised, it was in the original factory-sealed box and was not only unlocked, but it had never been locked or customized to any carrier so I will receive all upgrades straight from Microsoft. A few limitations such as no front-facing camera, but a terrific phone for the price I am a happy camper!",Very_Good

"PROS:- WiFi Connectivity- Usable with personal headphones, BlueTooth- LightweightCONS:- Mediocre battery life (can be attributed to usage)I bought this phone for its WiFi capabilities. I needed a phone which was compatible with Skype as I do long distance calls with this program. I am very pleased with my purchase. My only gripe is the mediocre battery life, which I think is due to the WiFi and BlueTooth modules being constantly on, plus the fact that I occasionally use it for 4 hours straight playing MP3s at the office. I should experience better battery life if I use those 2 modules only as needed.",Very_Good
This is a beautiful device. I had the Verizon branded Note 5 before trading it for a Note 7 (rip). The silver on this device isn't obnoxious. Both sim slots work with AT&T and T-mobile LTE bands in the US.This device takes beautiful photos. It actually works better than the US version sold by Verizon. Battery life is awesome. This device doesn't get hot when shooting video unlike other dual sim devices cough cough Sony. Xperia.The best dual sim device available right now and you truly get what you pay for.This device was shipped from Taiwan and I received it way sooner than expected.Device is brand new and the box wasn't opened. A+ seller will definitely buy again.,Very_Good
"I really like the 2D look of this case. I also recieved it really fast, 2 days after i ordered it, wow! It s a well made case, seems very sturdy, doesn t come off easy. all in all a great buy, for such a low price. I also got everything as promised, the screen protecter, that fit fine, but has a bubble or two, which it promised not to have, i can live with it and the wrist band as well, which i really didn't care if it was included or not, but i guess some people do, whatever.",Very_Good
I have had this phone in the past the only issue I had before is that it was overheating. Seems like that issue is fixed & works great! :),Very_Good
"I bought this phone for my mother to aid her in joining us in the 21st century. It was a perfect transition for her. The large screen was immediately attractive to her as it made everything easy for her to see. After inserting the SIM card the phone automatically programmed and was working in a matter of minutes. We did have a small issue with the data connection, but one call to the carrier revealed that we were the first customers to use this brand on their system! They walked us through manual setup and after a restart everything was fine. The phone is extremely easy for her to navigate, and she was comfortable with it in no time. She's now checking email and texting like a pro. This phone would easily cost double elsewhere. I highly recommend Blu and will be looking into the other products offered by them to find a new phone for myself.",Very_Good
"I am extremely please with my phone ,I haven't had anyproblems so far and the charge lasts a long time.I didn't find the phone expensive either.",Very_Good

Every thing works great I have bought many similar phones and this phone holds its own, nice loud speaker, nice call quality, nice Bluetooth and WiFi all works perfect also we're using with T-Mobile and it works great.",Very_Good
"This phone is a little TOO good...Ever since I gave it to my wife for her birthday she doesn't get off it. It's extremely fast, the battery life is absurd even though she uses it all day for her job (self employed) with bluetooth and gps all day long and when she comes home it's still at like 40%",Very_Good
"This phone is great. I got it for my daughter and she loves it. It does everything and more. It came in a sealed box and had the sim card in the box. Buy new, not used. The price is great. At the price you get more than what you paid for.",Very_Good

"I'm upgrading from a Motorola Atrix 4G (2011) to this phone. It has similar specs being a dual core cpu, 1GB ram, 540 x 960 resolution.This phone feels snappy, very fast. I'm not missing the auto-focus feature in the camera or the flash. The low light sensibility of the camera is very good, much better than the Atrix 4G. The lower screen resolution looks fine because of the 4.3"" screen size.Lower cpu specs and smaller screen help to increase battery longevity: I'm getting almost two full days with moderate operation. This phone is the best choice to upgrade if you don't like big screens or paying big $$$.",Very_Good
Great phone for price! Takes good pics. Easy to understand if you are familiar with Android.Love the larger size of the phone.,Very_Good
"I received my watch about four days ago and am thrilled with it! It arrived in an Apple box sealed and in like new condition. I've had to watch a couple of tutorials on You Tube on how to operate it, as the quick guide that arrived with the watch and the pairing instructions on my watch and phone don't even scratch the surface of the functions available with this watch. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller, it's been a fabulous experience!",Very_Good
"I love this phone! The camera is great, the display is beautiful, very fast phone. The batter lasts one day which I think is very good considering this is a dual sim phone. I have a t-mobile sim and a movistar sim on it and it runs very smoothly. Sony did a great job with the software that manages the SIMs. The only thing I didn't like was the earplugs that it came with, but I use some noise cancelling headphones that I have instead.",Very_Good
"I ordered mine from the seller ""WorldWide Distributors"" and had no problem at all. The product box was sealed, and the phone was definitely brand new. When I turned it on, the default language was French, but I was easily able to change it to English. Some reviewers said that their order came with an extra 110v-220v adapter, but mine didn't. I have a few of those lying around the house, so it wasn't a problem for me, but you should be aware that this international version likely comes from Europe and therefore the charger plug has 220v round prongs.The phone is still going strong a few months in, and I love it very much. Just be aware that you might not get the warranty service in the US. The warranty card it came with only listed European regions.",Very_Good
"It is a gift for my wife. She already has a Blackberry, so I thought I'd just stick with another one. She loves it and was able to use it the day she got it.",Very_Good
"Thank you for your HONEST service (TD) it was great....the iPhone 3Gs 16GB works great with my b Mobile SIM card (in Trinidad) it is factory unlocked not jail broken just as they said because i don't see a CEDIA icon, the box came sealed, the word iPhone etc at the back of the iPhone itself (is not in gray like the 3G) its written in silver to the back so you know its a 3Gs. I was scared at first since it was an online purchase but things turnout to be just as they said it will be.",Very_Good
