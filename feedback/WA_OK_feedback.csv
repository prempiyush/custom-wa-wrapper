"So my husband and I purchased this phone for use with WalMart Family Mobile which is through TMobile. Received the item VERY quickly, which was nice.The phone was in brand new packaging, and in GREAT condition. However, we purchased the SIM card, put it in and started the phone- it asked for the SIM network unlock code. This phone should NOT have been listed under the unlocked phones section.",OK
"I bought this phone from Amazon few months ago. It is a very good phone, however after three months, I have problems to charge it with the magnetic port, it would go up to 30 - 40 % and just stop there. I saw in many forums that this has become a common problems among the Sony Z family, do not know why. The magnetic port is a very convenient way to re-charge it and not having this feature working well is a big CON for me. I have already tried other cables and chargers, and the problem persists. The rest, as I said, a very good phone.",OK
About 2 weeks after purchase camera quit working screen is black camera says failed when you take picture bad camera,OK
I will give this review a 3 star.. Samsung note 3 is amazing awesome just wonderful so Samsung gets 5 stars but I bought this phone thinking that it would work with my Sims card but i was wrong even though it stated it would so I have to send it back.which is the second time i had to send a note 3 back cause of false descriptions. But the seller was nice about giving me a full refund.,OK
Great deal for the price. Negative aspects of this model are:+ battery duration (aprox 1-1.5 days with light use)+ has windows phone 7 (not 8) which requires syncronization through zune software (not possible with windows file explorer)+ not possible to choose size of fonts (windows phone 7 lacks this feature) and size might be small for people with eye difficulties,OK
Phone keeps giving a pop-up message that unauthorised threats have been detected on the phone.,OK
"I love the size of the phone and it was the reason I ordered this international phone rather than going with a standard S4. I really think it is the perfect size, not too big or too small. I use it on the straight talk and it was very hard to get the internet working. I had to call from another phone and several times until I got someone who gave me the right codes to put in. The speaker quality for phone calls is also pretty poor...I get a lot of echo and feedback. The smart stay does not work, it doesn't sense my eyes at all. I honestly don't think it's much different from my much cheaper samsung proclaim, except that it is much faster and has better screen quality if you are streaming a video.",OK
"The phone doesn't slide completely like shown in the photo. I was highly dissapointed.But if you don't mind that, its a lovely phone.",OK
"When we received the phone you could just barely read the packaging addresses. So I was glad to see it made it to me. The phone was listed as "" used condition with scratch and dent "". The picture did not match the phone that was sent to me. The dent was bad enough that a screen protecter could not be applied with out a bubble in its place. Overall the phone works great. If I would have know the dent was so bad on the screen I would not have paid for this one.",OK
"Great value. Certainly has ample processing power and great to have dual sim slots and SD slot.One thing I missed from my old phone was that the NUU X1 has no LED indicator. With my old phone, I could always tell if I had a text or missed call by the flashing colored LED. I miss that.I also have a strange problem playing audio on this phone that I haven't solved yet. No matter what app I'm using, every few minutes the audio will stop for up to ~30 seconds and then start from it left off. This happens when streaming from Pandora, or using Amazon MP3, Poweramp, or the android music player to play music from the SD card.",OK
"This is a horrible phone, I would like to return it and get a real phone, no Capacitive screen it barely qualifies as a touch screen. It did not come with the promised screen saver and repeated requests have failed to elicit the information on where to buy one. It won't respond to screen touch, you have to push the on/off button every time, they call it a security measure, I call it a serious design flaw. The verykool download does not work at all and it won't even assign ringtones to contacts. I hate that I am stuck with it for years to come because I am crippled and on a very limited income so buying another phone is not an option. I have never been so disappointed in a product in my life. The battery time is almost non-existent along with everything else, the pictures that were supposed to be so great are lousy. Nothing about this phone is as advertised.",OK
Bought this as a travel phone and served its purpose. Good for taking voice calls and listening to fm radio. Not ideal for texting. No instructions with the phone. I wasn't able to find the mechanism to lock the keys from accidental dialing.,OK
"I loved this phone except for one thing, NO GOOGLE APPS Microsoft apps is not working for me and they didn't have any. Not a huge selection of apps at all maybe like 100 altogether but other than that the phone was good nice big screen beautiful w8 layout I ended up selling it",OK
"A phone with great specifications for the money that was well supported by third-party software. Has an FM radio (not supported by third-party firmware.) The micro USB port is reverse from standard orientation, which limits using some peripherals. Does have NFC and hardware capacitive buttons, which I liked.Died after 13 months with a hardware error.",OK
"My husband is having a difficult time with this case. It does not always lock to hold the phone. You have to make sure it clicks in every time. Sometimes, it appears to be locked in only to fall out. He is going to buy a different case as soon as one becomes available.",OK
"This is an excellent phone but it does have an issue. I have purchased two 4 months ago with no issues. Purchased another recently and returned it due to an issue with the snowy white screen(static) which requires a soft reset. After a few weeks decided to return for refund thinking it might be defective and ordered a replacement. Received the replacement and carried out all updates and white (static) screen happened again during first day of use. I believe it may be software related rather than the phone itself. If it weren't for this issue, I would have given the Lumia 920 a perfect 10. If anyone knows how to resolve this issue, I would definitely be interested in learning the resolution.",OK
Took it to Europe on a recent trip and it worked great when we left and for 2days after we got there. The phone would not hold the sims card we receivedfor overseas calls (it accepts the larger sims cards not the smaller ones).I might as well not have take it with...,OK
"This was bought for a friend, and it was stated that the battery isnt holding charge for any length of time.",OK
"I can download some things and I can take picture messages, but the phone likes to shut itself off whenever I'm doing any of those things for too long (ie more than 7 minutes).",OK
"Outstanding functions, takes fantastic pictures with great Macro and high-speed capture.But the keyboard- yikes! No sensory feedback at all; it's actually tiring to use the keyboard. I had this phone for two weeks- the first week I toyed with it until I got an inexpensive case to protect it. The second week it was my full-time carry phone.I just couldn't live with the keyboard which is a crying shame considering the functionality of the device. I'm not a huge guy, but I just couldn't keep from hitting the wrong keys and it was painful after a while even trying.Pros-~ Outstanding photos~ macro, high-speed modes work great~ Fast focus, multiple shot modes~ Typical great Nokia reception, holds 3G really well~ Big, crisp screen~ Snappy OSCons-~ Unusable keyboard~ Navi-wheel is nifty gadget, but is only implemented in a handful of places in the OS and not at all in 3rd party apps. Too sensitive.",OK
Some of the bottons don't work and it doesn't vibrate when texts come through. It's hard to hear people when they call and it's not the service. Otherwise good phone for the amount of money,OK
It is confusing for saying sold by onePlus. It said it has 4G LTE but it does not have LTE!,OK
"It's Techbrutha back with a no-nonsense review. Long story short, I have an iPhone but don't want an Apple Watch. I want a smartwatch that's more of a standalone watch. I'm jealous of Samsung phone pwners who can get a watch that accepts SIM cards and can be used as a standalone device. After seeing YouTube videos that a Samsung Gear or Gear 2 can be paired with an iPhone, I bought both of them to try them out with my iPhone. I'm wearing the Gear 1 right now. The Gear 1 is Android based and I can sideload Play Store apps on it without the aid of a Samsung phone.I bought this, among other smart watches, to be able to pair with my iPhone and use as a stand alone phone watch. Samsung watches provide limited usage with an iPhone so I decided to try smartwatches straight from China. I decided to try this watch and it didn't work out. It didn't pair with my iPhone even though the specs stated that it would. Had to return it.",OK
The iPhone worked ok until a week ago when the headset stopped working. So I couldn't hear anyone unless on speaker phone. But it didn't have any scratches or dents on it.,OK
Not to bad phone good service on that company the I purchased the phone I got it in three days very good,OK
"It makes calls fine, but when you're using google maps it always loses the signal. It didn't play music files well either.",OK
Can't hold the phone without hitting some app or something. Has buttons on side and all over the face. Try to put the phone away and I'm texting someone. Too complicated for a 75 year old starter.,OK
At first everything worked fine but when I started turning it off and on it will never turn on. It's like It would start over wen I try to turn it on,OK
"Decent phone, but has a terrible problem with lagging and freezing that will eventually drive you crazy. Also, you will never have enough memory",OK
The phone is not bad but the screen and resolution it is too small and low for me plus the icons and other stuff looks no that good in this phone but at least works ok as a phone for calls.,OK
Just got my s5 mini. Not to ecstatic about this purchase. I bought phone as new but as soon as I got my package it was obvious this was a used phone. Had already been set in another language with some newly installed apps. Phone also lags. I've reset the phone and now will be adjusting to it,OK
"50 cents a call about...you have to buy a prepaid card, butthe phone works fine. For the price it was a deal.",OK
"One of the phones didn't work. I want to thank you to Amazon, because they've been helping me a lot with this.",OK
"I just got a Alcatel Idol 3 It didn't bring the sd card remover call Amazon they overnighted me new phone..Great job on Amazon's behalf..Now the phone doesn't play all kinds of music files as other cell phones in its catagory you would have to find or buy some program to change files to play your music. I found it to be slow,on ATT and the tap to wake doesn't work all the time sometime when you make a long distance call and try to hit speaker phone the phone goes black or you loss the call. I will try to keep several more days to see if an update is going to solve some of the issues if not Iam going back to the LG G4. I realize that you get what you pay for but not at the risk of losing calls from fam. I have tried the sam s5,Htc M one 9, Micro's 618 windows and and so far the LG G4 is the best even though speaker is not that great everthing else is..",OK
"Excellent mobile, good price, nice packging.The headphones havent levelNokiaovi have few programs for downloadQwerty is ergonomic but a littleNo case and usb conector for pc",OK
"The watch is decent but its still missing a lot. I paired it with my iPhone 6s and I liked that I was able to get notification alerts. However, the alerts pushed any notification that came through my phone and the maximum amount that it shows on the watch is 5. Every time I got any sort of alert it would say I have 5 new messages even when I only had one new one and the rest were old. You can't reply back to anything and the UI is laggy. The watch interfaces had a small selection and none of them were to my liking. The phone option is probably the best working part about this and the option I would use the least. You can actually call directly from the smartwatch, there is a dial pad, speaker, and mic. When using the Siri‰ÛÜ option, it works ok but it acts as if you are calling yourself. Overall, it's a nice smartwatch for the price but I would rather have more compatibility.",OK
"The wood looks finished in the pictures, but the unit I got was unfinished. I returned it.",OK
"Not the best phone I have ever had, but I wanted a phone with a full key board and no Data plan. I got that. Phone just doesn't work well, but it works.",OK
"Amazon advertises this phone as a 4G, but it is not... It is only a 3G capable device. So, if you are looking for a faster internet device, go with the C5503. I have not received mine yet, as I just ordered it yesterday. I had done research on the phone, and missed the facts about the 5502 being 3G and the 5503 being 4G until after I ordered it. As soon as I realized the diffference, I immediatly tried to cancel my order with Amazon, but of course it was too late.",OK
"It was fine for a little child but for an adult the phone was to small, otherwise the phone was great. The only reason I returned it was because of the size.",OK
"I was quite impressed when I opened up the package and saw the phone for the price I paid. It was amazing, doing way more than I really needed.It was bigger than I really wanted but as I said for the price I was ok.The problem was I couldn't get phone messages (voice mail) it had an error that I couldn't get fixed..They were Super about me returning it and was very prompt about refunding my money... I would do business with them again!",OK
"It wasn't unlocked and I had to pay to get it unlocked, and don't have wifi , but the phone is good",OK
The back came in cracked but it seems to help absorb the force when I drop it 2 plus times a day. The phone is durable alright.,OK
I'm keeping this as a backup. Loses signal in places where my Motorola phone keeps working.,OK
"excelent phone with winphone 7.5 upgrade to 7.8. good performance but not have flash,pross ,, SO, internal memory ,contra : flash camara, not have sd",OK
If you think your going to get a clean almost new phone forget it. What I received was a phone with a lot of wear on the case and a missing cover for the smart chip. Now don't get me wrong it did work and it is still working and solved my problem as an inexpensive replacement for my old phone. So it served it's purpose but I would have liked something that didn't look like it was rode hard and put way wet.,OK
I thought I was getting a new phone. One that did not have any scratches on it. But its okay. I have a phone that works but it freeze occasionally.,OK
The phone has some pros and consBaterry it's good enoughScreen amazingConsThe infrared led doesn't work I don't know if it's damaged it seem it is nothing connectedI can't update the phone doesn't give me the option in options and I was thinking if the phone is generic,OK
Love the protection on this case the only downfall is that the hot pink part on the case got dirty fast,OK
"The only drawback is that the Alcatel phone that claims to have 16 GB of internal storage, when I check the drive settings - storage, I find myself having only 10.95 GB of internal storage , in other words it was not 100% described the product sales , I get discouraged a little.",OK
"I have been using it for 6 months now and is great, but when i tried to change carriers i was told that my phone is locked. It is supposed to be factory unlocked!!?? now i'm at a loss on how to unlock my phone to be able to change carriers.",OK
"My main problem with this phone is that many apps close or get stuck suddenly, the same problem I had with my previous phone.",OK
"I love the size of the phone, but it's very dim. Also you can't download some apps. I tried going to the website and downloading apps. That didn't work so I try downloading the apk version's of the apps I wanted. That didn't work either. If anyone can help me figure out why I can't download apps I would give this phone 5 stars.",OK
Purchased this new unlocked phone to be sent to Jamaica. But phone was not unlocked fully and was not new. Phone is re-manufactured. So buyers beware don't get stiffed like i did..,OK
"Voice quality is bad on speaker and non-speaker phone modes. Feel like my ear hurts talking longer on phone. Other than that phone looks pretty good, good processing power as my other expensive phones.",OK
For the price you can't beat it. However the international phones do not support wifi calling nor does it support android pay. So it's up to you if those are deal breakers to you,OK
"The phone was advertised as new. The description even indicated that the phone was still wrapped in the original manufactures plastic wrap. Although this is true, the phone clearly is not new. When I took it to AT&T to get it activated I was told that the phone had already been activated and that somebody had already applied a screen saver to it as well. There are no visual defects, however, I feel mislead.",OK
"I ordered a refurbished model to replace the one I had. The touchpad for the middle of the keypad quit working on my old phone. The new phone has an entire strip near the top of the screen that will not respond. This blows. I like the phone, with the exception of having to dig two layers to get the the switch to turn on/off for mobile data.",OK
The case quality great. It's what you'd expect from Otterbox. The case color was not quite what I expected. It said the case was blue and gray. Turns out it's more purple and gray.,OK
It is a low end smart phone. It does a lot but it is slow. The most annoying thing about the phone is the number of times you have to touch the screen to get the keyboard to come up to send a text message. It can drive you crazy!,OK
"The phone works great all around. The only issue I have is the mini USB port on the two phones I purchsed are non functional after two months and the parts are almost impossible to find. I am still searching for a repair shop to find them! If K find one, I'd gladly give it 4 stars. Finding a case has been a bit of an issue too.",OK
It's is just Okay...It's getting full heat very quickly...and it is also hanging frequently...finally the mobile is not to my expectations as i enjoyed in videos...,OK
"Nice phone worth the money. Comes with free phone case, earphone and screen protector.I don't know if it's just my particular phone or this is a general issue, battery dies pretty fast. I actually think it dies faster than my roommate's 4 years old phone.Besides the battery, this phone can be VERY laggy sometimes (or should I say MOST of the time). I understand that this is a very cheap phone and there needs to be some sacrifices to make the price. To me I'm just using this phone as a back up while waiting for my new phone so I'm okay with all the problems.",OK
"I bought this phone for my partner, whose old RAZR had just died. On the surface, it's a very similar phone, but it has some notable quirks that make it frustrating to use. The language settings, which are very easy to select, don't seem to fully apply to the predictive text dictionary. Certain common words have to be typed in every time, and the phone usually suggests a non-English substitute. Additionally, the clock doesn't seem to automatically update when you cross timezones, which is a bummer. That might be a setting issue, but if it is, she couldn't find the menu.Overall, I think we'll be back in the cell-phone market within months of this purchase. It'll get you through, but this phone is pretty irritating.",OK
"the phone works great except it won't allow it to be used as a wifi hotspot on any network other than AT&T, i'm using it on Cricket's network that is owned by AT&T so i assumed that it would work like my old S3 did that was also on Crickets network but that was a UK unlocked phone that only had 3G not 4G LTE so i wanted a faster internet but i guess this wasn't the best way of doing it",OK
"Great phone, everything you have heard about it is true ALMOST.Build quality is first class, camera is great, sound is STUNNING, speed is everything you need, fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate.So what is WRONG, in a word BATTERY.The battery life is to say the least VERY DISAPPOINTING. If you watch the battery level for a few moments you can see it go down, even with NOTHING ELSE RUNNING.There is a plethora (great word) of settings to reduce battery life but what do they do? what are the consequences of using them, BEATS ME.I estimate that the battery life when the phone is in standby mode, NO calls, NO videos, NO music, NO browsing, NOTHING, IS BARELY 12 hours.If you ACTUALLY USE IT, then the battery life drops rapidly.I am going to RELUCTANTLY return the phone and go back to my MOTO X gen 1 which gives 24 hrs of moderate use.I will watch ZTE to see if they can improve this, the Axon 7 is truly a great phone but as of now they should include a hand cart to carry the necessary batteries.",OK
phone is norm. but is has too low sound i can hardly hear sound when someone is talking with me,OK
"I bought this phone and I need it unlocked, but I get locked one... It's really good phone, but if I can't use it on my (serbian) network, i don't need it any more...",OK
"The phone was purchased through an 'Alpha Wireless' supposedly in Texas but shipped from a 'Go Green Wireless' out of Florida. While I understand that several companies may cooperate to fulfill orders it does make it difficult regarding recourse when, in this case, a phone was represented as 'New' and simply was not. The price paid should have more closely reflected the condition. Buyer beware as usual when using Amazon or Ebay.",OK
"Great phone, but the translation to Portuguese it's not so good, some words on the phone didn't has an translation.",OK
could not get it to receive pictures or send them either-i took it to an ATT center to no avail- i had to buy another phone,OK
"Product arrived in estimated delivery time , a week.i ordered two refurbished.one came in the official my touch case with headphones,wall charger,and a cloth.the phone looked good as new besides a mnor scrape on the back case.everything functions properly,the internet connect is fast it came with a screen protector and a black silcon case.very nice. although im having issues with my sim card , it says unlocked but i continue to have no service so im going to tmobile today to see what i can do.my second phone didnt come in any case or with anything else.works properly , everything functions normally.everything appears new but the back of the phone has some pretty heavy scratches , nothing else asides that.and this phone is actually unlocked and works with my sim card so thats a plus.overall : for the price,the quality is acceptable. good as new but few minor setbacks.",OK
"The phone works fine, however the television does not. Also the ringtones that comes on the phone are unappealing. I will need to download another ringtone.",OK
"i like the phone so i give it three star, but the screen don't last long. it is quit to break and there is no spare battery that come with it. where can i get a spare battery please.",OK
The item I saw on the picture bought and after delivered very different. When I ordered I didn't read (SK) where it made it. the manual is a Korean language for set up very complicated so I am not happy about it.,OK
"Purchased this to see if this kind of smart bracelet would work for me. I didn't want/ need an athletic based bracelet (but this does have a pedometer function). Took a couple of days for me to figure out how to set up the dang thing (directions worth the purchase price alone for entertainment value...not being in IT, I'm not used to the Chinese translations done by Chinese, so syntax and phrasing pretty funny). But I finally figured it all out, synced to my iPhone 5S--it does do what I needed: allows me to be aware of calls, messages when my phone is buried deep in pocketbook, and, it lets me know if I leave my phone behind. Wish Apple would consider this kind of thing....",OK
Good phone but it lags a lot. I don't know how to fix it and it gets frustrating when trying to use it. Good for calling and texting but not for any internet or app usage.,OK
Although I have not used the phone yet because it was delivered without a memory card. The phone does turn on and key up really fast. The is a nice size and can support a 32GB memory card.Once I receive a memory card I'll be able to give a better review.,OK
"Basic cell operation is cumbersome, battery is very weak, losing info all the time, have had to replace twice since original purchase!:-(",OK
"I used it for 2 months before I write this.the phone is light, but the screen is kinda torturing to me cause I switched from SAMSUNG Galaxy 2.also, when i put the phone in pockets in jeans, it ALWAYS squeezed the buttons at the back.other than these, it is a good phone for this price.",OK
It was a used phone so there was some problems with it. Other than that it was fine.,OK
i have a few comments on this for example it's an excellent product for data purpose or wi fi connection because it's very fast but bluetooth doesn't working properly and the camara should be a lot of better because doesn't fit in the 5 mp description at the end for 90$ it's a good choice but i was expecting an upgrde product from nokia-microsoft,OK
"It's and ok phone but can't find a good case for it. And after 3 weeks of owning it, I dropped it on the ground and that is the end of this phone. =(",OK
I was taken aback by the reviews which led to buying the phone. According to the price of this phone you really cannot ask for much but huawei should have taken care for some things at least from the software point of view. The phone says it has great performance but it is lags a lot many times. The cons on software side are:1. Slow response to many apps2. Not the perfect fingerprint scanner.3. Music UI is only defaulted to default player. Some apps have control on screen lock but does not work on this though.4. Camera hardware is great but needs a lot of software touch.5. Contacts app crashes at its will.Cons for the phone build and HW1. Its slippery2. Buttons are clicky but lack a good feel.3. No replaceable battery.Pros for HW and general phone.1. Spectacular sharp display.2. Amazing sound.3. Good camera.4. long battery life.5. Decent optimization options for battery life and accessibility.6. Aluminium body looks great.,OK
"I couldn't download any apps when I first got it, So I reset it and that corrected that issue. I also have issues w/wifi connections (but that could be self inflicted. But I will say that it seems like a great OS and I'd definitely recommend it .... :-)",OK
"This is a good phone, but it is a little bit slow for me, but for my mom is excellent. other issue is its RAM memory it is so small",OK
"Word to the wise: Check with the seller for the type of service this phone does NOT work with if you are technically challenged like I am. I learned something new - ""unlocked"" is not ""unlocked"" for all mobile service carriers, like Sprint. It would have been helpful to read that in the product description before purchasing. It seems like a perfect phone for seniors. Apparently I was having a senior moment when I ordered it.",OK
"this phone looks good but does not ring as loud as my old razor phone. it has caused me to miss many important phone calls, as I use it for work and personal purposes.I am definitely NOT SATISFIED with this product.benny dupre",OK
"This phone looked great however, it would not stay on unless it was plugged in. But Amazon has great customer service and reimbursed me and we shipped it back for free. Another phone was purchased and it works great!",OK
"pros- micro size but acceptable performance and battery.- feel like portable mp3.cons- music stuttering when screen off.(very annoying) <- fixed by firmware update- need more UI customization. ( notification ui, keyboard... )- really bad usb connector.- too tiny for input.",OK
Great phone except my GPS doesn't work. Don't want to hassle with a return. Next phone would probably be screwed up too.,OK
I received my phone today! It's very nice except missing features. I was expecting 8 mp front camera as advertised by seller but camera in front is 5 mp! A little false advertisement,OK
"I'm researching how to trade this unit for a different phone. Here are the issues I'm having:1. Screen is HYPER-sensitive to moisture. If my face gets moist (summer) (a) the phone begins to make selections at random; (b) I cannot swipe until the screen is COMPLETELY dry. A single raindrop will cause the screen to go haywire randomly typing, selecting items and opening programs.2. Camera only has 4 settings, will not allow zooming, and is a VERY poor quality photo. (My previous S4 did not have this problem.3. An error in the unit which will not allow me access.I believe that this is a bit of a gamble with refurbished phones. I bought an S3 as a backup (using it now) and it works great. My previous S4 was wonderful until it lost a fight with a set of stairs and a concrete floor.So right now I'm giving it a 3. I'll update after I get my replacement.",OK
"Bought this for my elderly mother. It is pretty nice. It is fairly easy to use. Most importantly, it has large buttons and a fairly large display. It was also easy to add to my AT&T account.A couple of negatives. The SOS button is a nice feature, but is fairly easy to set off. So be prepared for false alarms. Another issue, the phone only displays the time in a 24 hours system. For example, 2:00pm is 14:00. This is extremely confusing for my mother. I bought this phone last Nov. I called Jethro sometime in Dec regarding this and was advised there was a firmware update coming out late Dec / early Jan. I waited until Feb & emailed. Told an update to fix this is time display issue was expected in March and to continue checking back with their support section of their website. I've called & emailed several times regarding this issue and I am told the same thing everytime; a fireware update is coming. It has now been 6 months. Just be advised, the phone only displays time in a 24 hour system.",OK
"This is my first smartphone, and although I know their battery life is much shorter than other cell phones, the battery went down 20% after watching one five-minute video. I contacted the seller if this was an issue with the phone itself, but they sent me an extra battery instead of actually telling me what was wrong, which I thought was OK at the time. But the newer battery depletes even faster than the one before, and I have to charge it every few hours so it won't die. I've also noticed that the phone (probably mine in particular) won't allow me to use the finger scan to unlock it (saying ""an error has occurred. If this continues to occur, turn off and on the phone and try again,"" or something like that).Overall, for the refurbished version, it works alright and is cosmetically fine.",OK
It's a shame that Sony did not pay enough attention to this product. It lacked memory and processor power.,OK
"Very nice device, but I got the refurbished one. Also I found hair line scratches on the screen.",OK
I bought this as a gift for a 12 year old and it definitely served its purpose. No complaints,OK
"I have so many problems with memory, in spite of installing an sd card and trying to transfer over what it will take. There's so many glitches, from memory issues to simple commands not working. I don't mind the phone, but I don't think I'll recommend it.",OK
"The phone came in, great exterior appearance. Now keep in mind, I am a technician, so the first thing I do is check hardware. I went ahead and started to test everything. This wasn't supposed to have any hardware issues, just scuffs and scratches, but the left bottom speaker was actually not working. I was kind of disappointed in that because it was a gift to my girlfriend, and she did notice it right away. Even though it did have a dent, and a blown speaker, everything else worked fine. I'm satisfied, but then again, I'm not.Recommend this seller, at caution.",OK
Slow!!!! I just strictly use my phone for calls and check my email for work..I'm not really a cellphone person...I've been using it for about 2 years now....I honestly don't care for it...,OK
"This is my second C3. My other one lasted about 4 years....and NEVER needed a new battery. I wish it had a more powerful camera, but that is my only real complaint. Be careful when you buy it...my other one had a more standard QWERTY. This one is basically fine, but it's a French version or something. The question mark and exclamation are in a different place (which is surprisingly annoying). Also, you can find the remedy through kind people who have posted the solution in Amazon, but if you have AT&T (maybe others too), you will be unable to send/receive picture messages/texts until you do some manual configuration. Once you have the directions, it is super fast and easy, but there is no way I would have figured it out on my own!!! Lastly, I am sending my second one back today because it simply stopped working. I""m so disappointed.",OK
"I had doubts before purchasing this product, but my doubts failed me. The Phone came as described by the seller and was in perfect condition. it was working fine during the period i used it, but after 6 months it switched off and refused to turn on. and the warranty did not help because it was an international version.",OK
"After having a Google Nexus 5 for over 2 years (which only broke after a bad accident), I thought this would be a flawlessly comparable unit. In comparison to the original 5, it's a little wider in the screen, and slimmer overall. However, mine got EXTREMELY hot upon charging and crashed the first time I opened the camera. It is FAR more fragile feeling than the original. It doesn't have the dense heavy-duty rubberized casing, but more of a thin plastic casing. I returned this unit and bought a new original Nexus 5 D820 instead.(This is not meant to be a review of the seller, who was great on all fronts, from delivery to customer service to the return, or the interface Android OS Marshmallow, which I mostly enjoy on other devices, but only of the hardware I received.)",OK
"I had the phone for 3 days so far. The phone is terrific by every mean :The HD screenThe amazing front and back cameraThe size of the screen and how handy it is to do almost everything you readBut there is one major problem with this phone:= THE BATTERY =- charges very slow- gets dried out real quickand another problem with the phone is not actually the phone itself but the case that comes with it:1) it makes it nearly impossible to charge the phone.2) the audio port is kinda loose and delivers terrible audio quality.3) whenever I try to take the phone out of the case, it takes the back cover with it ( every single time)---------------------------Long story short:The battery and the case are killing me, but I like the phone so much that I am still going to give it time to try everything in it!",OK
"I have to say I miss my Inspire. This phone does not have the buttons above so texting for me is torture. They could have atleast added swipe. Oh well. I did not receive an unlock code3, and can't test it is, coz I haven't been able to get time to get a non-AT&T sim card to test with.",OK
"Don't know if I shall be able to use it. I have not been able to understand how to use it. The instructions with it were not so I could understand how to use it, they just told where everything on it was. I would give instructions an (F). I used ear buds and then when I took them off I was told to put them back on and did not know how to make it the other way. This is should to be a simple phone, it may just be me, but I hate to think what it would be like to get a much more expensive smart one, so I am glad for what I do have.",OK
The internet only work with wifi. I canceled my internet plan because once I left the house the internet would not work. Its slow!,OK
All I can say is that the phone does not bring the Spanish language to Venezuela other at all well!,OK
"This was purchased in 2009 with a contract renewal with T-Mobile for $250 (with rebate). This is the Samsung SGH-T919 or ""Behold"" as it's known. This is the American release of the Samsung F480 Tocco handset released in the European and Asian markets.I was very impressed with this handset. I had been a faithful Motorola and LG consumer in the past, but when my fiance (now wife) got this I was so impressed that I sold my LG KU990 ""Viewty"" and got a Samsung M8800 Pixon, similar to the Behold but with an 8-MP camera and 3.2"" screen. Handling is excellent. It feels weighty in the hand and makes it easy to hold on to. It's high quality and good-looking too. It's made of metal and plastic, but feels hefty. The battery cover is made out of aluminum with a brushed finish. You can get it in different colors: espresso and rose pink.",OK
"I ordered this phone and the seller sent me 2 earphones and no sync cable, dont buy from this seller",OK
"When I ordered it at the end of June, I was happy. It came fast and looked new. But In mid November IT QUIT WORKING. LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING. IT WAS NEVER DROPPED AND I HAD A CASE ON IT 24/7 AND IT JUST RANDOMLY QUIT WORKING. I am so mad . I spent a huge amount of money and its already broke? Thats bull crap.",OK
"The watch arrived on time. Looks great. Set up wasn't that hard. The only problems I'm have are, text message won't show up on the watch (message keeps saying please install BT Notifier app in remote device.) I've already installed the BT Notification app, even though my call logs show up, my contacts show up and everything. The other problem is no one can hear my voice thru the watch. Other than these 2 problems the watch is as advertised for the price.",OK
"I bought this phone a couple of months ago and so far its okay, the only complaint I have right now is that I can't find a case at all for it.",OK
"Product reached on time. Over all it is good. But, I have a GPS issue. It does not track the position when i use it for navigation. S Health does not track the miles while Biking. I have tried Factory reset and Flashing the device by Samsung support. It din't work either.",OK
iPhone 4s. Came charged. Had to update. Having phone for two months now it has some issues. It dies at 30% battery and crashes randomly. Would not recommend to a friend.,OK
"I was very happy with the phone, but could not activate my AT&T service and had to return the phone.",OK
ATT has settings in the phone that can't be removed. So it isn't totally unlocked. I have had some problems with battery life when Bluetooth is turned on. I have yet to get the web to work on it with my provider. Calendar doesn't have a birthday/anniversary event option.,OK
"Definitely not certified refurbished, the charging spot is really loose! They also didn't send me the right charger! this was a gift for my dad, and he seems to really like it. I don't have time to return it nor does he so he's going to see how long the phone lasts, hopefully long but that charger spot seems to be pretty loose. i also think there was water damage to the phone, where the battery pack is there is that little white sticker and when it gets wet it turns red, well this one has red X's so i think that might mean water damage. I will update my review if anything more seems to go wrong with the phone.",OK
The first one we got was broken. The replacement is meeting expectations and doing the job.,OK
"Was a bit more beat up than I was expecting, and did not work properly once received. I was able to fix it, and works fine now.",OK
I got my phone on time and I looks good but when I got mine the box was in Arabic so far I have 3g speed (I had 4g) also it over heats when I play games Idk if it's the game or the phone processing it but all in all I guess it is ok,OK
"Volume and Power Switches on the right side are cheap plastic design, built into rear battery cover. When I removed the battery cover to insert Sim Card and MicroSD Card, the Power Switch button was detached from the cover. I had to struggle to install it back. I am afraid that the next time when I remove the cover to replace Sim or MicroSD Card, the buttons might break off completely. Then, I will have to buy a new battery cover. Touch screen is not sensitive enough. Virtual key board is too slow to touch.",OK
"It is not soft, malleable, rubbery. It does not easily slide from your hand, so it may feel rubbery to some people.",OK
"Everything about this phone was okay except for the fact that i got a micro USB instead of a 3.0 which charges a lot slower. At first I thought that was normal and that it came with a micro USB but you could buy a 3.0 for faster charging, but then I found out S5s are supposed to come with 3.0 chargers which is very disappointing.",OK
"Pros: Wonderful phone. Good seller. I like the phoneCons: I can not register this phone to get technical help from Samsun since it is an International version. No one year warranty, simply you need to trust that this phone will work with out an major problem. The warranty card the seller sent is useless because to register this phone I have to go the [...] I believe Taiwan. Everything is written in Chinese, and I have to provide local address in Taiwan. Living in U.S how to give a local address in Taiwan? So the warranty form the seller sends with the product is useless.Samsung customer service could not help either saying that ""they can help only for the product designed for the use in U.S only, they can not help international version phone. You can get the help only from country of origin"".I am not sure If I will ever get Marshmallow update on my phone. That means I struck with the same version of Lollipop.",OK
I chose this product only as a switch from another brand. I really like the full screen & large font on the front screen. Ease of handling is a +. For these features I would recommend.,OK
"My experience with my BLU Studio 5.0C HD has been mediocre. The phone has a very short battery life, is prone to overheating, and not as easy to customize and/or use as other Android devices I have owned (Samsung and LG).",OK
i buy this phone and when i recice that is no accessories like ear plugs.,OK
The phone came with a broken exterior speaker and the ear speaker is not as loud as it should be.,OK
"I bought this phone according to THE REVIEWS. Not sure if the reviews are phonies! I did miss one or two important notes. My phone too did not work properly. I thought I could resolve the issue. I mean who would purposely sell a phone that would not work? So AT&T said, 'nope' it should work call the seller, Phone USA said, 'nope' call Amazon, Amazon said, 'nope' call Pantech. So I was unable to resolve the issue. I just wanted for the phone to work. It looks like a great buy. But what good is a great buy that doesn't work and no one will support the device, not even the sellers?! Oh, well, good luck to you all!",OK
I bought the phone it looks great no scratches nothing it was a used phone the only problem was the batterie dies in about an hour and sometimes doesn't even turn back on it takes about 30 minutes. I tried contacting amazon and they told me to check with apple but apple didn't do anything.,OK
Battery life is not that great. Comes with many good pre-installed apps. I disabled and uninstalled many of the apps but that didn't improve the battery life at all.,OK
Description did not match unit. New screen but bad back and dinged corners and damaged moto x badge. Description read slight screen image but good back. Was able to replace bad parts with my good parts but still not as described. Also came with AT&T bloatware that I can't get rid of even as I thought I was getting a T-Mobile phone.,OK
Great phone only complaint I didn't realize it was a VERIZON unlocked phone I needed unlocked without provider but was glad they were able to set it up,OK
"The biggest problem I find with this phone is a very aweful sound that the person on the other end of the line gets. When you call someone with it, the noise they here is unbearable at best and have heard it for myself having somone call my other phone with it. I read about that noise in someone else's review and thought that it was a one-off issue and that I would be fortunate to not have that problem. no such luck! Disappointed about that. Other than that it would be a fairly ok phone. But what good is a phone that has poor call clarity!?",OK
This was a very cool phone. It had a very quality feel and was very thin. Unfortunately I had trouble hearing during calls so I returned it and ordered a Vivo 5. I wouldn't hesitate to give the Vivo Air another try because I'm sure I just had bad luck with my phone.,OK
"its a nice phone but the battery life is bad, it has already spoiled. the phone comes on and goes off and i dont know where to order another battery",OK
"I want this phone, but doesn't have all frecuencies needed... some countries the 3G doesn't work becase the 850 MHz frecuency is not in que equipment. In market, other smartphones are fast tan this.",OK
I have this phone but bought this one for my girlfriend. She loves the screen size amd battary life. The back case was for the wrong phone but we bought a new one for really cheap so it wasnt a problem. Could be for someone else though so that is definitely worth noting. For that reason it only gets 3 stars nut great product other than that!,OK
"Everything is good and new, the box includes: 1 bb 9360, battery, earphones, 1 piece charger and a nice leather case with the blackberry logo on it BUT there is not USB cable!!! That's why i'm giving only 3 stars........

"I ordered a Razr phone. It's old bute it is what I want. It will not work with Verizon so I amreturning it. I have ordered another phone that says it will work with Verizon. Will it really? They are very particular about this. I need to know if it's going to work or not. If not, I'll have to return it also. May I please hear from someone on this matter. Verizon will only tell me yes or no.Thank you,David Shulldshull@comcast.net",OK
Bought this for my daughter and she really liked it....it did what she wanted and was a pretty neat phone.,OK
after some time of using i realize that the network signal was bad i had to go outside of buildings to get the signal to make or receive a call other than that phone is great and multifunctional for personal use,OK
Its an alright phone. Some minor scratches and buffs. and it runs slow and freezes other than that its an alright phone i guess,OK
"a great phonesometimes it shuts off and restarts by itselfi thought that i could just go to store and buy a phone case, but they have to be specially madenice hd screennice soundno 3gwifi is okayoverall for the price I paid its a great phone and woul buy another just because of the price",OK
I had ordered this phone and the overall service was good however i really wanted the leather carry case but was dissapointed to find out that it was not present inside the box.,OK
"The phone is okay. Keys are too small for my hands. The battery life is terrible, I have to keep switching back to my old phone to saty up & running. I wish I had b ought a slide-out keyboard type phone instead. For the money...disappointed!",OK
The screen started freezing and shutting off about 3 months later. The same thing happened with the last one I got.,OK
"The product is OK, but I had ordered the phone in white and it came in black.",OK
"Everything positive that has been said about this phone is true. But the face chat is not that great. I didn't have any complaints until I called my friend and we chatted over the video phone camera. And I don't know why but when I go to google images, the pixels on the images are pretty bad. I've never had issues with that on any phone, and I've had the Alcatel fierce 2. So I gave it 3 stars for that reason.",OK
I love blackberry but the is could be better. Phone is new but it's freezing and such. I don't like that but the phone looks nice. Video can kinda sucks. Don't like some of the multitasking options but I love my phone kinda lol,OK
"Returned phone due to very poor camera. I did not use it at all except testing the camera, so cannot comment on anything else",OK
"i AM AN OLD LADY WHO NEEDS A SIMPLE CELL PHONE MOSTLY TO PLACE AND RECEIVE CALLS. I ORDERED THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF ITS PRICE, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE OWNER'S MANUAL WAS IN polish! I have contacted Amazon and tried to follow their suggestions, but have not had any luck. One of the suggestions was to contact the manufacturer and they could not help me. I have also tried to download a manual on the internet, but it is very complicated and have been unsuccessful. Any ideas?Stumped in Kiev",OK
This phone was nice more advance than the Blu Life One L120 but you could not hear well and it was returned,OK
the phone i purchased said it was carrier branded and comes in the original t mobile box...but instead an at&t phone arrived in an at@t box...this is some bs because my internet wont work,OK
"Although we had many problems with this phone,they did refund my money in a quick amount of time and I just wouldn't recommend buying a used HTC evo 4g.",OK
"If my son wouldn't be completely out of a phone, I would return this phone. The battery keeps falling out.",OK
"It's the kind of android I was looking for, but it has a BAD battery! I do not use data (having opted for a 1 GB plan), yet after recharging all nigt, the battery was down to 37% by 11 a.m. I took it to the AT&T store, and they confirmed that I was sold a phone with a bad battery.",OK
No instructions came with phone screwy how the menu is screwy hard to use but better than what I had . Comes with navagition but requires subscription and is to fat. Works ok though,OK
"This is a good cheap phone, meaning it is good for what you pay for. Im not impressed, but its an OK piece of hardware. Software is another story. The custom GUI is just crap. Way to heavy for this phone which makes it lag at times. Full with bloatware which you cant delete. Far worse than the original android interface, and its translated by the engrish.com team... Camera is 13MP of noise and bluryness.For those researching, it will NOT WORK on 3g in MÌ©xico. I bought it and know for a fact. Two of the sellers said it would. Well, they are wrong. Keep in mind HSDPA 850 != UMTS 850.",OK
OK Phone not very user friendly. But ok if you ned a spare phone. Would be nice for a young college girl or a young female executive,OK
"Not nearly as nice as the pictures portray. Scuffed and scratched, although everything works well.",OK
"I pay $30 for unlimited data/text and have 100 minutes of talk, and if I need more I just use the Skype app I downloaded and buy minutes from there and talk for 2 cents a minute. Compared to the $90 with my contract phone this is great! Unfortunately, the phone is rubbish compared to my previous HTC HD7. I try and keep my patience and remind myself of the savings but popping my battery out to restart my phone because it freezes several times a day gets extremely old. I have downloaded just a few apps such as Words with Friends, Draw Something, Fruit Ninja, and a couple others. They all run fine but when I just want to put my password in to access my phone there is some serious lag. There is also a bunch of preloaded apps that I will never use that you cannot delete. For now I'll tough it out because I love dishing out at the most $40 a month compared to $90 just beware and be patient.",OK
Like the phone alot but I gave it a 3 star because the battery life is horrible.. It doesn't last long when I'm playing a game or watching a video or movie.,OK
good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible,OK
Phone has potential but it needs some improvements. I honestly think its a steal for the price I paid. The camera is pretty nice. The quality is pretty good as well but I've had issues with the software and the keyboard is annoying. The accuration is off on the keyboard and the calibration is weak at times but other than that it's a pretty good phone.,OK
Freezes up frequently. I bought a black and loved it so much I decided to buy the white one for my daughter but it didn't perform the same. It freezes frequently especially when you try to use multiple functions.,OK
"Pros: The phone is very fast and fluid. Nice screen and camera.Cons: No 4gLTE in the U.S.!! This phone doesn't have the correct bands to support 4gLTE on At&t or T-Mobile. Battery life is bad, it drains too fast playing games.Overall it's a good phone but if you want 4gLTE or even 4g in the U.S., don't buy the international version, get an At&t Unlocked or T-Mobile variant.",OK
Still using this phone and it is still fully operational. I only use it now to make and receive calls. In the earlies it use to freeze for some strange reason and the battery would run down. Now it takes 2 days before it dies. It takes long to boot up whenever the battery is pulled like with all other blackberry. For an older model blackberry this phone might not be an interesting buy since some apps (whatsapp) now no longer work with this model since the OS can't upgrade higher than 4.5,OK
"When I run 5 - 6 apps all at once, this gadget always freezed, and i had to restart many times.",OK
not worth preferably buy another model of blu but this blu studio selfie 2 is not recommend for example if you are going to put an application on the SD card gets slow and if you are in the application of whatsapp and you send a photo takes to upload images that you have on your SD card,OK
"phone works, delivered fast, service also good (came with bad charger and got replacement quickly), only downside is battery does not last long, need to charge ofter, but no complaint.",OK
"Just what I wanted and very attractive, but comes with a non-standard size charger which doesn't fit, and the standard size chargers that fit everything else do not fit either. Since the phone cannot be charged, it doesn't work, and I am trying to return it.UPDATE: took phone to Verizon store and discovered that the charging portal was not on the side but the bottom of the phone. Problem solved.",OK
"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 WEEKS AGO. THE ONLY OR BIG ISSUE IS THE BATTERY IS DEFECTIVE , IT DOESN'T EVEN LAST 6 HOURS EVEN THOUGH I DON'T TALK OR PLAY MUSIC. I DON'T KNOW IF THE SELLER CHANGE THE BATTERY AND GIVE ME AN OLD ONE. OTHER THAN THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD PHONE",OK
"I'm giving this a 3 because I got it some months ago and its absolutely a great phone I fell in love with it! But there's one problem. ghost touch , it seems to be a very big problem. At first it was just annoying it would send my messages early and type for me but its gotten to the point where its unusable I can't type in my password.",OK
It's a nice phone but the camera SUCKS & that's the main reason why I wanted a new phone :(,OK
"I bought this to replace my broken phone until I was eligible to get my upgrade from Verizon, it served its purpose.",OK
"The phone is nice good value. However, the earbuds I got were faulty. It has been over a month since I contacted Blu about replacing them.A month, after a phone call and two emails, I have not gotten a replacement. Their customer service is very poor. I guess they don't careabout supporting their products. I wonder what happens if you have a more serious phone issue?",OK
Its a great little phone--didn't work with my intended provider but that's more the fault of the provider-- good luck,OK
"sellers must be clear in thier discription.This phone do not work well with ohter providers, even though it is unlocked from Verizon.I will not recommend to any one to buy any Verizon unlocked phones.",OK
The phone overheated when I just use it with the screen down and battery saver on I returned it and got the Z5,OK
I have purchased this item as a gift for some one.. unfortunately when the person began to use this unit it was found that this unit has a number of physical and mechanical faults and/or problems.. the screen is loose or slack when it is depressed. also the battery get extremely hot after 10-15 minutes use.the phone discharges in about 1hr and needs to be constantly recharge some times 4 times in one day ( 8-12 hrs ). THE unit itself tends to lock up or seize up regularly .I AM DISSAPOINTED..,OK
"I bought this phone simply because it was cheap and I needed a phone ASAP when my other one was about to die. It is pretty simple to use and pretty basic all around, but it was too basic for me and I decided to spend a little more on another phone with more features.Note: This particular phone was released for the German market; (which I knew upon purchase) So, you must go in the controls to change it to English function and there is no American plug outlet.It's a good phone for someone looking for an entry-level ""smarter"" phone. It's easy to use and cheap.",OK
i do not recommend for use without case and screen protectorafter a month of use:- glass have scratches- plastic edge of the display is damagedandroid 6 do not available on current date (26.02.2016) - current version 5.0.2,OK
"The button at the bottom of the screen rotates constantly, probably from some DIY person taking it apart to change the battery and breaking it. With the battery supposedly being brand new it doesn't hold a charge very well, or very long. The motion detector chip is also broken (probably also a result of the DIY battery change), so the health app doesn't work because it doesn't detect movement. The earpiece is quieter and more muffled than my previous phone, which is another downside. Whether or not that is yet another result of the battery change or simply a factory defect, I don't know. I rate it as 3-stars (meaning ""it's okay"") because I did buy it used and suspect I can't expect high quality. It's ""okay"" simply because it does work, meaning it gets signal, it allows me to make phone calls, and my apps (with the exception of the health app) work.",OK
"My husband is happy, but you'll need to purchase a chip for it. I wouldn't want it. Reminds me of every other tablet. Nothing fancy about this one!",OK
This phone is so heavy!! My arms get tired holding it for periods of time. The battery life is good to last almost a day with consistent/ heavy use.,OK
but the charger doesn't fit into the port and doesn't charge the phone. unfortunately i returned it. but the phone itself was great.,OK
Phone came in with more scratches than stated on screen. Not to happy about that on the money i payed for the phone. Phones to seem to be on. Lags a lot but Verizon said it the phone or software,OK
"4G LTE is not working for the fact that the bandwidth of the 4G this phone uses is different from that of T-mobile which is 1700/2100...data will be just 3G/HSPA+...same as G800H. So i think Samsung G800H will be working in the same manner in USA. Otherwise, the phone is just working perfect till the moment.",OK
"Pretty good phone, but the Moto G now has a problem with disconnecting from you provider ever since the new KitKat 4.4 came out. I haven't heard of a definite fix and my phone is constantly losing connection to the ATT towers. Other than that it is great, but this issue, is of course, not acceptable and extremely annoying. Hey! my phone doesn't connect to the network. Yay!! Exactly what I always wanted. Or is it Google's fault? Supposedly this started after the Android update.",OK
Good phone. The only problem is windows block certain app I would have like to use,OK
Too heavy. And the Cyan model I got was not matte as reviewers stated. Rather the unit I got was glossy. Besides the heavy weight of it it is a decent phone. Only wish Windows would pull some teeth and hair to get popular apps on its store.,OK
"I've had this phone for about 7 months before I dropped it on its screen for the first time and it cracked.Usually with a cracked screen a phone is still functional.... that is not the case for the Idol 3.It was fine at first it has a really nice design and great display. The camera could be better, but I cant complain about that considering the price tag.The only thing other than the cracked screen problem was that the phone was oddly buggy?Certain apps I would use like Snapchat or Miitomo would just.... Stop Responding whenever I used them.",OK
"You get what you pay for right? This got me through way too long of a period after I broke my phone. Couldn't really stand it though, although it had its perks. Taught me to spend less time on my phone and enjoy life a bit more. Screen has an effect that kind of gave me a headache to look at it. Sort of a blur effect. Super slow. Texting is faster on an old T9 flip phone. I put this is 3 stars because it's ok based on the price. Not horrible, and probably compares well to your other options. Was nice to upgrade to the Galaxy S7 from this baby.",OK
"I received this phone and was really amazed at how pretty it was, I popped my sim card and battery in and it worked right away. the internet was ok, not as good when not connected to wifi, but it was decent.one thing I didn't like was that I never got 3g service much, it mainly said edge. the other issue I had was that I couldn't receive txt or calls from my daughter, that was a major issue for me. I was disappointed that there were no cases for this ph. the only ones were the flip open ones and only like 2 colors of hard back cases. I tried cases for the galaxy note and they didn't fit. one good thing is that this phone comes with a regular battery back and a flip battery back, and it comes with a screen protector installed. overall the phone functions ok and it will do the job, but I personally didn't feel like it was good enough. if you want a pretty looking phone with basic features than this will probly be ok for you.",OK
The phone is refurbished. While the phone looks in very good condition but the quality is really different than the original phone. My home button now really hard to press just after 1 month of use. The side body also feels like cheap plastic not rubbery like the original one. I can really say the quality is not the same as the original because I also have the original one that I've been using it for more that 1 year.,OK
"I like the size of the phone. Whatever happened to the days when we were supposed to make things smaller? I suppose those days are gone with most people ""needing"" to watch YouTube videos in 1080p.This phone has the right size to it, but the internal memory has much to be desired. It also doesn't use the micro SD card slot to move apps over to... I know it can probably be rooted to accomodate for this, but why must it be rooted to install more than one app on here? Isn't there an easier way, like an OTA update or something? I'm not that technically savvy... but I would like to install more than one app on here. After all, this is supposed to be a smart phone.Other than those quirks, I like the phone and use it when my daily driver would be intimidated by mother nature. The speaker can be soft at times, but it works for me.If there are any changes to my review, I'll update when I'm able to.",OK
"I thought that the phone was cool until i played with it for like 10-15 min and then it started to freeze up and you would have to take the battery out just to make the phone unfreeze, if i were looking for a phone, i might try looking for another, unless i knew why it kept freezing up.",OK
"The battery in this phone becomes loose very often and the phone has to be taken apart , then reinsert the battery. Very annoying. Apart from that it is a nice phone.",OK
"Like everyone else said, phone is T Mobile and with ny carrier i only have axcess to edge/2g network on this phone. Wouldve been nice to know, fairly clean phone. Only scratched on the battery cover.",OK
The phone came with NOTHING ..... It was fully charged though which gave me enough time too get a charger and headphones,OK
"i really liked this phone however, it was missing the small tool i needed to insert my sim card.",OK
"I bought this phone mid-February 2013. I paid for Saturday shipping and it arrived on schedule. I was surprised at how small the phone is, but it came in new condition (i don't yet know if it's unlocked although it SAYS it is.) I will agree with several people about the bad battery life. It takes about 6-7 hours to charge the phone and about 1 hour (or less) to drain. Good thing is I called the company who shipped the phone and the CSR offered to send me 2 new batteries. I should have been suspicious because both of the new ones are bad also. But on the flip side, at least I have 3 batteries. Everything works well, except youtube which doesn't always play the VIDEO but does play the audio. Overall the phone is nice, but the battery life sucks. This would be a good starter smart phone but not for a serious ""APPer""",OK
"The phone seemed like it would work, but my carrier would said it wouldn't work with them. When I told them I would like to return it because there is no use in keeping a phone that you won't do anything with the response I got seemed snippy as if they thought I was telling them the phone didn't work. I simply stated that ""it would not work with my current carrier""",OK
"I really WANT to like this phone. HUGE problem: it completely shuts itself off, especially overnight. You have to remove and reinsert battery to power it up again. This is my only means of communication and this is a huge issue. Did not know about this before I purchased, but after looking into it more, I find that this is a pretty common problem with this phone. If it weren't for that, it is a great phone. :(",OK
Iread and was anticipating a memory card and earphones which I did not receive. if entitled I eagerly look forward to getting them. At least a response.,OK
Be aware that this item does not include a power supply. The included micro USB will only provide 0.60 amps of power throughput when trying to charge an iPhone and an iPad at the same time with this setup. The iPhone and iPad will constantly chime as they start and stop charging. I returned mine.,OK
"After 2 months of use...I was very happy at first don't get me wrong. There are lots of positive things about this phone.I had an Xperia z3 before. Here are my gripes..No DLNANO MIRRORLINKNo wireless chargingDid not support 128 GB micro SD. Tried 3 types.No device encryptionThe last one...was a surprise.Within one month, I had the quick charge not working. It would only slow charge. Second replacement in the way.",OK
"At first, everything was okay. all apps ran smoothly. The camera was perfect to take a self file or an view picture.But after using 5 months, This phone sometimes shut down immediately although I do not restart or using any strange apps. I reset phone and erased everything, this fault have still repeated.I bought it when I was in usa. Now, I comeback to my hometown. What should I do now? I'm so worry.",OK
"These worked okay for about 6 months then the battery life started to dwindle. They say refurbished, but it was more like used. Although the finish and exterior were in excellent shape.",OK
Great phone is every aspect except for the phone itself. Talking reveals a defect in the phones design. The other party can annoyingly hear themselves when they are talking. I also tried to disable the noise cancellation microphone and it did not change anything. I returned this phone because the Phone in next to non functional.,OK
"This is a weird issue, First of all I wanna be clear that this cellphone is very good for it's price. However, I don't know if it's a chinese imitation or not, but if you make a little research about the Ascend Y300, you'll find out that this cellphone has some features that this product doesn't have. I'm talking about FRONT CAMERA and FLASH. Also, this model shouldn't have double sim supported, but it has!It comes in chinese so FORGET ABOUT GOOGLE APPS, you might wanna use the System chinese apps or download some non-google apks.I like this cellphone, but I think this publication is a little deceiving. And if you can find this same model but non-chinese, go and buy it there.PS: It works in Venezuela with DIGITEL very good, but haven't tried the Dual Sim in Vzla.",OK
"Great phone, but having problems with TMobile service. Can't txt people with Verizon and for an unlocked phone, should have come with directions, and explained what unlocked phone limitations were.",OK
"Needs more embedded language options. Samsung is generally very good, just needs to be able to use in other countries.",OK
"I received the phone in a tattered case, it looked used and torn up. When I pulled the phone out it looked new and had most of the parts. I had to buy a sim card before I could take pictures because the phone did not come with one. There is also not enough storage on the phone, I downloaded a few apps and shortly got a message that the memory was full even with the additional sim card that I purchased. Otherwise, all the features on the phone worked fine.",OK
"Love the size this phone - fits in pocket without the normal smartphone cinderblock feeling. 3G speeds are good in my market - 2MB up and 4MB down on avg. Could not get it to connect to TMobile H+ after multiple attempts with TMobile customer service. (not a deal breaker). Recommend getting another charger because the battery is only good for a 10-12 hours of use from the go - I expect it to get worse. The palm OS is by far the easiest I've ever used - to include andriod and iOS. Not going to get any real apps with palm but I knew that going in. Has everything I need for email, talk, text, and light web use. for someone who still wants a phone with buttons - I like this choice. No issue hitting the keys.",OK
"Bateria increible, solo eso... de resto un android cualquiera. a veces se pega, se reinicia solo...",OK
"I bought the phone for my husband who is in the early/moderate stage of Alzheimer's; he is able to make and receive calls. He does have some trouble using the phone book but that is probably the illness not the phone.My great disappointment is the GreatCall Link, the service does not work on my iPhone 6 at all and very sparingly on my computer. I have spent hours on the phone with tech support, they tell me they are working the problem with the iPhone and my location(a very rural area) is affecting the computer link. So disappointed as I had hoped this would be a means of finding my husband when he wanders.",OK
Everything would be alright if it wasn't for the battery charger. Doesn't belong to this phone. For real I CAN'T USE IT TO CHARGER MY PHONE. For the rest is ok!!,OK
"I can't really accurately give a star rating. I bought this phone as mine finally gave up the ghost and what I read on it said i would be perfect for my needs. We're moving to Europe soon, so the international was a must have. The price fit my budget, and the reviews (mostly) said the phone would do what I wanted it to. I researched and looked at all sorts of reviews. I should have gone to phonescoop.com. Nowhere in the listing does it state that this phone doesn't work on the Verizon network. Instead, there was a little note in the box, like an afterthought, that has instructions for putting wifi and MMS settings, and oh, did you know? This doesn't work on Verizon or Sprint networks. I have been without a phone for four days now, and cannot afford to be so with a husband doing military training elsewhere and two small children. This would have been nice to know BEFORE purchasing the device. On the plus side, it's very lightweight and fits perfectly in my hand.",OK
Smaller than I thought it would be. Works just fine for my Husband as he just wanted a simple phone to replace his broken LG,OK
"Shipped quick, great phone, only 3 starts because my microphone did not work unless its on speaker. Kinda stuck on weather to send it back and be without a phone for 2 weeks and go through reactivate or just get a blue tooth device and not even have to use it.",OK
"This is nice watch, if you are looking for receiving calls and few basic functions, its great. I thought its full android watch, so I can use apps like Golf GPS etc, but those doesn't work. If you are using phones app only, then this is great product for that price.",OK
I am not as happy with this phone as i thought i would be or as i should be considering what i had to pay for it....it is slow to respond when connecting to things it freezes a lot and you cant type a text message as fast as you should be able to because it freezes when trying to text the message. Not very happy with this phone.,OK
Overall it is a great phone..software and apps is as good as Windows phones get. ....BUT the battery life downright Sucks. ....it takes forever to charge and a a 5 min call would take away 10% battery life....and this was not jus a defect on the particular phone because I exchanged it n the new one was the same...,OK
"Stay away, this phone is laggy and slow more than any other nexus phones I've owned. Even my 2013 nexus 5 performs better. It would run well for a little while after factory reset.",OK
Just got it today dont have Google play install on it but I love what I see so fare value for the price but I will see how the battery keep up will update but a great buy love it,OK
"Normally I don't like to write bad reviews for products I buy, but this time I thought I would shine some light on this phone. First off I'd like to talk about the ""first impression."" When I ordered the phone, I ordered a 32gb phone, and received a 16gb phone instead. I emailed the company that send it, assuming they would replace it, and I have yet to hear back. I have Consumer Cellular, and I installed the SIM card as instructed. It would only let me text and call, but it would not let me use data at all. The third thing that made me decide to get a different phone was the microphone was broken. No matter who I called or what setting I chose, the person on the other end of the phone could not hear me.Overall;Pros:-Phone is fast-Awesome resolution and picture-Good cameraCons:-Home screen navigation takes getting used to-Original start up was in a foreign language-Microphone did not work-Data would not work-Sent wrong phoneHopefully this helps!",OK
The camera is not much and sometimes the device is somewhat slow. I've had better experiences with other Xperia models.,OK
cell equipment was not new it was pin contacts and other settings and other information I demand an explanation and compensation in any way that their product was new as published and is the opposite,OK
Works as it says. Used t-mobile SIM. Kinda flimsy as the silver piece came off while peeling off the plastic. Stuck back on tho.**UPDATE** stopped working completely (with no water contact). it started to tell me to insert sim so i restarted it and it never came back on.,OK
Choses this rating as it seems to be ok but not as satisfied with it as a previous phone of seemingly same model. The older one seemed to work better with a few more options. I chose this phone becasue of the color so it would not match my husband's of the same brand. The only reason I bought a new one is that the screen on the previous phone broke.,OK
"I really liked this phone. Until the screen cracked. I have no idea how it happened. Pulled it out of my shirt pocket to answer a call and there it was, LCD was black and glass was cracked. The case I had it in, that was supposed to protect the glass, was unharmed, no scratches or indications of impact. A replacement digitizer and LCD is $10 less than a replacement phone. I guess I don't need something quite so sensitive in my life.",OK
"I gave up my Iphone for something simpler (I have a number of lines so I still have smart phones). Small and light. It comes with a european two prong plug which then is paired to an adapter. Also you can't change the image on the home screen, so I hope you like flowers. I can't complain for what I paid.",OK
"Well in general terms, but the back cover is weak, there was a crack with a slight pressure, internet runs slow in enclosed spaces. The Xperia Z2 is far superior in all lines.",OK
"Listen this is a really cool phone. Don't get me wrong. However, you cannot use with enterprise services if they require encryption. That normal standard android function is completely missing from settings (under both security and storage). Needless to say my husband is quite happy as he has a new nifty phone to play with. Sigh. Lovely screen, on screen key board worked well, acts as a tethering/highspot. Off to find a new phone for me as husband does the ""I got your phone"" dance.",OK
Great phone! Love the size and battery life. However the phone constantly freezes up. I just returned one for the same reason thinking it was that particular phone. However once I got this one I realized it is the 4 series. I will be going with Apple for my next phone now that they come in larger sizes.,OK
"I received the Lg phone, which has included headphones, which is a very negative detail since it acquired for $ 300 at the time.truth disappointed with this detail must now acquire a headset or headphones. I'll be testing the equipment to give them information about the performance.",OK
"SPEAKER VOLUME IS TERRIBLE,WISH I COULD REMOVE THE MOST FREQUENT CALL NAMES FROM HOME SCREEN",OK
"I like this phone because it is compact and sleek and has the features I want. This phone has Windows Mobile 6.5 professional. I am Microsoft Outlook dependent I need all of Outlook features including the ability to sync the calendar, tasks, and notes with my desktop computer. The latest versions of Windows phones cannot do this. These days the newer versions of software are missing important features. The only thing I don't like is, like most Microsoft operating systems, it gets buggy after awhile and you have to reset the system.Update: Had this phone for about a year and I'm having problems with an unresponsive touch screen. I'm downgrading my rating.",OK
it great phone for its price and it has alot of space. slow at times and sometimes it loozes connection,OK
The phone turns off and on whenever it wants to even; if it has a charge to it. And sometimes it comes on in another language other than English so I have to take out the battery for awhile then replace it back into the phone. Other than those two tings the phone work okay!.,OK
I give it 3 stars because there's a off on the screen I don't what it is for.,OK
Nice phone but . . . the software in this phone is for the oriental market and will not access Google apps like Playstore. The seller says it should work but it doesn't. No easy solution. Buyer beware.,OK
"Got stucked on start up (Windows Logo screen). Had to reset the software to factory settings. Followed this guide: http://theinformr.com/answers/i-brought-a-nokia-lumis-530-today-and-when-i-turn-it-on-the-nokia-logo-comes-up-then-goes-then-a-blue-windows-logo-stays-on-my-screen-and-the-phone-wont-start-up/After that, the phone worked.",OK
"The phone came permanently locked. That means that it cannot be unlocked unless tmobile, which is the company linked to the phone, helps me out. So far i had to open an account with tmobile because i did not have any phone and it just was an emergency. On the other hand the phone works well.",OK
"The blackberry battery is with problem, its working only half day with full charge, its a problem, but now I'm in Brazil, where I can get other battery on warranty?",OK
"This is a great phone for the price, but the OS takes up half the storage space, so you are left with only 4GB of free space assuming you have removed all the bloatware. Since android does not let you change the default download path, this can be annoying if you like apps as an external SD card will not help. If you only have a few essential apps or dont mind manually moving every app to an SD card after install, than this phone could be for you.",OK
Too thick of cell phone and too small. I like the larger screen size cells.,OK
I loved this phone until it stopped charging less than 2 months after I bought it!!!! Worked fine when it was working. Wish I'd purchased the warranty.,OK
": ) LIKE : )* good size screen* peppy processor* stylus for handwriting tasks: ( NOT : (* poor antenna receptionPurchased the phone back in Nov. 2012; and creating this review in Jan. 2016. I had always thought the poor reception from the Galaxy Note-II cell signals was due to the area I am at. Until I recently switched to a different phone, I realized now my area isn't the cause -- My Samsung Note-II simply has a crappy antenna design which impacted the reception strength. My new phone is getting signals where the Note-II had failed; especially when attempting calls indoors.",OK
"This case isn't the same as the Skinu case. I ordered again from my history and noticed it had changed to Toru but thought maybe they were bought and have the same product with a different name. No, not the same. This left side is not snug enough to hold any cards. I had to put 2x sided tape on my license to keep it from falling out. The right side with the door is too snug now. My debit card is difficult to slide out, and I'm scared each time that I'll break the door doing so. The overall case fit my phone well and seems to be holding up. I usually go through about 2 a year and only bc eventually the door breaks off. Once the door breaks on this one I'm going back to the Skinu brand.",OK
"I'm a bit disappointed. The build quality is good unfortunately the display seems a bit dark and fuzzy as compared to my galaxy s5 and my older iphones 5 and 6. The picture quality is also not as good as my older smart phones. Battery life is ok but I only tested it for a short period of time and considering it is new,",OK
Short life batterySometimes freezesAlways Black screen when made a call or answer one.Showed up just at time.,OK
"I am traveling later this week and will write more on this phone. First thing though is that I got the phone without a manual. Disappointing, but not a deal breaker - yet",OK
This is just what the wife was looking for. Its like a tablet and a smart phone all in one.,OK
it's not as responsive or quick as it should be but it will do in a pinch,OK
It's okay has it's good and bad but I have year warranty so I will see what happens,OK
I have to sy that the phone is not that bad. The only thing that gets me mad some times is that the phone shuts down by it self. That's a detail you didn't put in the item descriptions!,OK
The touch screen is extremely faulty. The apps are outdated because it is an older phone and it has no storage space. If you want a cheap sturdy smart phone this is the way to go.,OK
"It worked ok for a used phone, volume down button loose on phone when got phone",OK
"I haven't been able to turn on the phone yet, because it said it comes with a wall charger and it didn't. Which really disappoints me. But the outside of the phone was like brand new! No scratches or anything noticeable. Hopefully when I get to turn on the phone it works well.ALSO! The phone said it comes in silver the phone I received came in red!!!! I do not like that either. I got a phone cover for it at the same time as well thinking the phone would be silver but the phone cover looks silly now because the phone color looks bad with it. Now I find a charger for the phone and its not turning on!!",OK
Was ok but did not last with my friend. I wish it lasted but never was this one. Very sad,OK
I got SM 900FD instead and I returned it!! I don't want this issue to happen again. Idk what to do,OK
Sometimes Says No Sim When The Sim Is In The Slot & Is Inserted In The Phone . Phone Also Works Slow But Other Then That In Good Condition,OK
"good phone, but lots of bloatware. also, you can't use mobile hotspot, which kind of sucks. screen is nice though and the phone is very responsive. but then again I'm writing this in 2016, so there are way better choices available.",OK
this a straight talk locked phone. it advertises being unlocked but when you buy the sim card starter kit it wil not recognize it because it is a straight talk phone. if you are buying it because its unlocked don't.,OK
"I have a outer box for my phone and sometimes it doesn't charge, I have to keep moving it around on the charger b4 the blue charge light comes on. It also take hours b4 it charges the phone. For the price it okay",OK
"Suppously it come in an original box and with handsfree, and it doesnt come with it. I will wait for your answer.",OK
It is okay but the phone (battery) cannot be charged with a USB car charger?! Could this be a defected unit?,OK
"This phone is 4G and runs off the Sprint network. Just go to your local Sprint store and have them activate it! I got this for my girlfriend as a replacement phone until her contract runs out. She likes it and it's great for texting, calling, facebook, and other basic stuff, but don't expect to be playing many games and resource-heavy applications.It runs an older version of Android, but you still get most of the stuff that modern Android has to offer. The UI leaves something to be desired and is a bit laggy. If you can, I suggest rooting and putting a custom rom on it.As for the keyboard, it took some getting used to since she has been so used to touchscreen keyboards, but it has worked great and is a nice fit.Docked two stars for the laggy and ugly UI, as well as weak system specs, but you can't complain much for what it's priced for!",OK
"I did love this iPhone however; I had to replace the battery twice, and ultimately I can nolonger use this iPhone because I let it update to iOS 9.2 and it froze my phone to recovery mode with the itunes logo. I chatted with 3 techs on apple.com to try to resolve the issue, and from 11pm to 4am, this iPhone would not recover back to normal, so I took it to an apple store later in the day, and to my sadness, the phone could not be restored, they offered to sell me another iPhone being that this phone was pass warrenty, the replacement phone would have cost way more than the price that I paid for this phone. I am very upset, because I just recieved a new battery for the phone last week, and I had just received an iHome that I purchased the same day that this happened, and here is the kicker... I had just put minutes on this phone 5 minutes before letting it update.... So dissapointed",OK
"I paid $80 something for it. For the price the phone is good. There are just minor things I dislike, Generally the use interface's, and the maps/navigation. I also cannot access google play. Other than that it gets the job done. If u need a cheap replacement phone, this one gets the job done.",OK
The phone displays 4.55 GB instead of 8 GB as advertised. A little disappointed with the produnt because I was purchasing with respect to the capacity.,OK
"Good slim phone, very stylish. The only problems I can address is the small storage capacity and the speakers when trying to play YouTube or music only utilizes the bottom speaker near where you talk.",OK
"Wife loved the phone, except that the software kept over-heating. Causing the phone to shut off for lengthy periods of time.",OK
The phone is in better condition than I hoped for but it has some slight mechanical issues. I had to put a case on it because the back was wobbly.,OK
"Probably not the best Blackberry for everyone, but it has good basic features, although somewhat slow to work. Let's say 3 star out of 5",OK
"Scratches on the screen, back, and sides. No accessories came with the phone, just the phone itself and the battery.",OK
"Pretty decent phone. Have had mine for a few years and still going strong. I never really needed anything fancy in my phone and this one is really great. Only problem is with the slide, after a few years it sticks a bit. But that's just with any phone.",OK
"I just switched from a Nokia 2710i Navigator to the Nokia C6 just because the 2710i Navigator, which I bought on a trip to Germany, does not support Wi-Fi access. I tried for hours loading some MP3 songs to the phone via Ovi Suite. In my last attempt I finally shut down the phone, connected again and suddenly it worked. I was loading also some Maps and was surprised, that after some 10 maps the 2GB memory card was almost full. When I checked the sizes of the maps I noticed, that the C6 maps consume almost ten times as much as the same maps for my 2710i. So keep in mind that you might need to buy a bigger memory card. With the 2GB card you are quickly running out of memory.After all I have the impression, that beside the wireless access, the C6 does not offer much more functions as my old 2710i.",OK
Didn't have a problem with the seller. Liked the phone. Did my research. Did everything possible to solve the problem but still was unable to receive mms over Consumer Cellular. Microsoft was no help. Very disappointed in Microsoft! SIM works perfectly in another android phone. Ran all updates. Factory reset three times. APN settings perfect. Got to the point where I could send MMS then Microsoft updated again and could no longer send/receive MMS.,OK
Overall the phone came very quickly.. Very user friendly. A couple of disappointments ring volume and speakerphone are not loud at all.. Pre installed apps are boring.. Definitely not a galaxy...,OK
Phone was in amazing condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it,OK
the sim I brought didn't fit the phone and I returned it on Wednesday the 14,OK
"Phone was in great condition, even came with a charger but the problem it had was that the battery life was horrible after a week and I wasnt to happy with that since I wound up buying a new battery for it.Overall it was fine, got me through being phoneless. All that matters.",OK
"Just thought it would be lighter, a bit too heavy. Screen not as big as I thought.Its not a bad phone, just the weight.",OK
I really liked the original Sparq cell phone because of the keypad that flips out. I hate texting so it works great for me. Although the keypad on this one looks nicer it is not as easy to use especially if you like to use punctuation. There's these annoying icons that keep appearing at the top of the screen when you use different things that I don't know how to remove. The battery life is not as good either although not terrible. The camera is terrible as well. It is an okay phone for a dumb phone but I think I will be looking for another one soon.,OK
Good product. Only problem was we needed to be able to connect with digicel and couldn't. I was under the impression that unlocked meant we could acess any of the providers. Not the case here. Our other smaller blu phone had no problems.,OK
"Great phone, just it freezes up alot, didnt have the time to send back for new one. Dont make otterbox case for this phone.",OK
Listed as no contract and ready to use but phone was retired by Verizon and could not activate.. Nothing wrong with the phone besides not being able to use it.,OK
"This phone is well made, and looks sharp, although it is a little bulky. I enjoyed the camera, and adjusted to the operating system (very easy to use), but a few software glitches as well as a lack of apps made me return mine.",OK
"Phone OK and a LOT cheaper than Galaxy 7, butBattery life is no better than Galaxy 5 - about 1/2 day at most if I do't use it.",OK
It's a very good phone. I like it and I already bought 2 more for my friends. The only problem is that it freeze all time,OK
It sucks how I can't return this.I kept calling the number to return it but they didn't pick up.It said 90 day warranty but it was only 30 days smh.,OK
"Its a good phone, has to problem, you cannot change the battery (closed) and cannot input an sd card.I bought 2 of them and one has an error when its update de OS, is reparing it now because the ROM fail. I dont know if it has solution....",OK
This item came in fairly good shape but all the cords that came with it did not work on the phone so we had to go buy the proper cords.,OK
phone works nicely however it does not charge due to the fact it will not get a connection to the charger. I have used different chargers non work in it. I settled for a separate battery charger to charge the battery.,OK
"This phone is weird. It works. That's good. The pictures are fuzzy. The screen is fuzzy. The buttons are always getting pressed during phone calls, making it annoying to both parties. The windows platform is pretty good.Once the phone called the number I was already on the phone with. Don't even know how to do that.My nice Galaxy s5 was stolen, and I'm still paying it off. That is the only reason I bought this. I should have just bought a better phone.",OK
I brought this for my wife because she wanted to start texting more. Problem with this phone is the keyboard was too small for her to use so I returned it. Return it was not a problem. The company gave a prompt refund without a hassle. I did like this aspect.,OK
"Since the iPhone 6 Plus is large, this OtterBox makes it huge and clunky. It can be difficult to put your earbuds into the output jack and the power connector in. The ""flaps"" that allow access to them are quite stiff even after a few months of use. The volume and on off buttons are more difficult to use too. They require a lot more pressure to activate. Really defeats the up volume button for use as a shutter button. Guaranteed movement. The clear screen protector cover doesn't fit tight to the screen so it becomes a hard tap or more than one tap to actuate your touch screen buttons.But...it does do a great job of protecting my iPhone.",OK
"The mediatek CPU is fast and the phone is mostly nice, my biggest two complaints are as follows:1.) The screen I received in mine was one of two variants they are shipping. I recieved the Innolux panel which has a gammut of 70, the colors look a bit washed out and the screen has backlight bleed in. Overall moving from a Galaxy S3 to this massive screen still feels like a downgrade in some ways because of the lack of poppy colors/deep blacks/backlight bleed in.2.) The mono speaker sounds like it's equipped to a tin can and has horrible audio quality, if you enjoy watching videos and wish to appreciate the sound at all you will likely want to have a pair of earbuds/headphones.All in all for the price I can't complain much, next time I think I'm going to do a little more research before purchasing. If SONY would have only shipped the Truly LCD Panels and actually equipped it with a speaker that didn't sound like rubbish this would deserve the full 5 stars.",OK
I am not satisfied with the trackpad. It feels like the ring is loose and it rings each time I press it. The back of the phone also don't fit tight. Apart from these obvious defects it is ok.,OK
"u sold me this phone and told me that charger is on the way and is been 3 month,when is the charger coming",OK
"just know that it is an AT&T phone that has been unlocked. I have this same unlocked phone from the Microsoft Store, and there is no branding on the splash startup screen with any carrier.it did work with my T-Mobile card, however. I just like to have all the details. It makes me nervous to open a package I have ordered and have AT&T written on it (seeming to indicate it is carrier-locked).",OK
Screen gave out after 6 months and I had to have it replaced other than that worked for 2 years and then gave out,OK
It's heavy and not quite as responsive as some of the Lumia phones my family has. The display doesn't seem quite as good either. The Lumia phones are a better value. It does have dual sim slots though if you need that.,OK
"Might be looked at as a previous generation phone, with the G4 out, but this is a great phone, and with the added bonus that this is now an ""old"" phone, it comes with a reasonable price.While a clean Google experience fan, the LG launcher and included utilities do not seem to hinder performance or usability as happens with some other OEM phone (Samsung are the worst in my experience).The migration tool is not very useful. None of the ones I saw is. I backed up to Google, and reinstalled the applications, which is fairly straight forward.== Update ==I dropped from 5 to 3.The device I got had a faulty display. As I was oversees, and did not have the time and facilities to return it, I want to local technician. Turns out this device had a non-original screen (on a device sold as new), which was faulty (the display layers were separated).Once fixed (at an extra cost), it's a great phone, but this should not have happened.",OK
It runs great most of the time and I've had it for almost a year now but the phone has started to open apps by itself and is having charging issues. The phone all so does not come in English so you have to go in the settings to change that.,OK
The phone was okay. But the charger was broken and it didn't work so I had to buy a new original one,OK
"This phone will not go to 4G in my island, Curacao. Because here we use LTE 800/900/1800/2600. Another bad thing is that the phone, don't have LED indicator",OK
"I got this phone for my mom and although it has been going strong since I bought it, I believe it was used since we have had some problems with utilizing it.",OK
I bought it because I have two lines from different providers and Wanted to get rid of carrying two different devices with me. I thought I could buy this Lenovo which has the possibility of two sim cards. But you have to turn off one line to use the other one. It does not work for me. The idea was to have them both available at the same time as it is possible with other smart phones which are very simple and unexpensive. It was disappointing.,OK
"This phone has a main feature I like. I love the fact that you can silence a call by flipping the phone. Which does not happen in one action, I need to attempt at least 3 times for this action to be effective. It does not have the water sound effect I love when dialing as the basic Samsung phone. It is constantly defaulting to vibrate without me even touching the phone. I have to go into settings at least 5 times a week to change the default to ring and also change the volume. Maybe I bought a defective phone.",OK
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,OK
"The phone works well but also has a terrible battery, the other day started dropping 1% each second after I watched a video. Sometimes some apps dont work, it takes like 5 second to get into the pictures you have already taken. The signal is normal but I think other phones are better. Its annoying for whatsapp because when you hold the phone it records a voice message and sends it without previous notice. when you have it blocked the phone with a password you cant have a quick access to the camera or other things like you do in the iphone. It takes good pictures, but it takes a couple seconds sometimes to just open the camera. Now is having trouble to play the videos in some web pages because it just slowed down the audio.",OK
The phone is good for the price. I would've given it a higher rating if there was an option to save everything to an SD card without marrying the card to the phone.,OK
Lasted a few months. It was good while it worked but then the phone turned off and never turned back on because the battery was bad.,OK
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",OK
"I bought this long ago and never reviewed it. Hard to remember but if I hadnt liked it I would have returned it I think it was fine. I ""upgraded"" since then",OK
"Hola amigos, compre este telefono con la plena confianza de que recibiria un buen producto mi mayor sorpresa fue que recibi un telefono usado con una bateria china usada y maltratada, el track ball defectuoso la tapa no calza, sin audifonos, un cable de datos motorola y por la caja se ve a leguas que este es un producto reconstruido afortunadamente le funciona el teclado, el pin, pero no es la idea no recomiendo comprar telefonos desbloqueados por esta via.",OK
"The back of the watch has a very fragile material. It broke down after a couple of uses. Other than that, it works fine.",OK
Does not seem to be a brand new phone but it works well. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase,OK
Not a bad phone but way too outdated for today. Speaker stopped working after a year and I fixed it by taking it apart and pushing the ribbon back into the slot. Happened again after 2 more months and I replaced the phone.,OK
"Does not come with the USB-adapter as other reviewers have mentioned. Comes in a plain box with the power cord and fast charger. The phone is flawless on the outside. The back of the phone says ""REFURBISHED BY ASURION"" etched into the metal, underneath the IMEI number.",OK
This phone works good. I would let everyone know that this phone says it is a smartphone but it is not. Had I known this I would have not bought it. Otherwise it works pretty good for it being a regular cell phone.,OK
Fingerprint sensor was not working out of the box. I had to return it due to being defective.,OK
"Many apps aren't available, the phone is durable, great battery life and doesn't take up much space.However don't expect it to work as efficiently as regular android systems as it's only able to perform half of the expected android features.Great Camera but no instagram.",OK
I thought the seller would send a new phone.....but it was used....after all...it worked good!,OK
"the chargers did not work in the us. seller sent me 2 adapters that also did not work . had a hard time finding charger for these phones, and had to purchase them myself, phones are good but value went down with charger purchase requirement.",OK
"The phone is OK. Not bad for the price. A bit plasticy compared to my KRZR but seems solid enough. The Nokia UI isn't as customizable as I would hope for (no ability to add applications to the home screen etc.) but this isn't a smart phone so it is acceptable. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that I got it after being assured by a Nokia sales person that it will support SIP out of the box. It doesn't. I then tried 3rd party applications. It only runs mini-fring (no SIP) and Nimbuzz didn't manage to connect to the network (this may have been T-mobile's fault, who knows). I was forced to return it - I guess if I want SIP I'll have to shell out for a real smart phone.",OK
"I needed a phone for my business, and it works well. The battery sucks, so I bought a back-up (dirt cheap). This is the second time I purchased this phone. The best feature on this phone is the nav. It rocks! Better than my iPhone nav. Good back-up phone.",OK
"the only reason I said it's okay is because ,when I received this phone it had an crack in the left top corner and I wanted it to be a Christmas gift hope she doesn't mind it .",OK
"The phone works well, but is not the phone I ordered. The phone I received is a Motorola. It was also very dirty when it arrived.",OK
The phone works with the new battery but has to be restarted every couple of days because it says it can't read the Sim card. But it's fine other than that. .,OK
This worked well for what I needed it for. Can't beat the price. Used it in Cuba and it worked just fine. Very long battery life. Giving it 3 stars because to access the battery is next to impossible. Took several tries with a knife to pry the back off. It is not very user friendly in that respect.,OK
"COME ON! With a camera like that- like THAT Nokia, what the hell is the deal with a measly 32GB??? This phone rocks, rocks like a boss - OR WOULD rock like a boss if it had the storage capacity of the modern century. It's ridiculous, if you're an audiophile - like me! And a serious pro photographer - again like me! 32GB will go like yesterdays hot wings.Bottom line if you are like me and make a lot of pics and listen to a ton of photos, this phone can't handle it, not at 32GB. But if you don't have music and wouldn't bother making a lot of great photos with the amazing camera on this phone, then by all means buy it. It is a fantastic device.",OK
"The phone had a little scratch on the back and the box looked like someone already had opened it. However, the phone is working fine and we really like it, takes good pictures and the screen is crisp and clear.",OK
"The phone is keeping charge, but whenever my phone rings it is difficult to answer. I cannot answer the phone",OK
I purchased an unlocked phone and got a locked phone and had to spend another $60 to unlock it. Very disappointed considering I do not live in the country to return it.,OK
"Bought this for my mother, thinking it would be easier for her than an Android or iPhone. She hated every moment.",OK
Needed a phone to use since I washed mine. This one served to fill in the gap until I could buy what I wanted.,OK
"This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet.",OK
"UPDATE Dec. 28, 2015 - This phone was returned. Nine days after receiving it and using it, the battery stopped charging and the phone went dead. I returned it and purchased another smartphone with a different OS at a local retail store. So I cannot support the previous review any longer.No issues with the phone itself and its quality. That its a 5 star. My issue and the reason for the three stars is that, the description should have said ""Unlocked AT&T Galaxy S4"", not just ""unlocked Galaxy S4"". The phone has AT&T starting music, symbol, web browser, and all the apps that come with an ATT Galaxy and ATT contract! It took me 3 hours on the phone with MY phone provider to set the phone with THEIR network, it also took me a whole day and a whole battery to delete all that ATT stuff!",OK
Wifi didn't work on this phone. It wasn't from a lack of trying. I liked other features of this phone and that's why I gave it a 3.,OK
"This phone does not have gorilla glass. After six months the screen cracked for no reason. I used a case and did not drop it. A little pressure flexed the phone and cracked the screen. My boyfriend had the Idol 3 5.5 in, and his screen cracked without being dropped also. I should have read more reviews. The phone is too flexible, and the screen is not strong. I googled it, and it is a common problem.UPDATE: The phone screen did crack, and it was a design flaw. However, Alcatel honored their warranty and repaired the screen. I was not happy that the phone was damaged that easily, but it is one of the best phones that I have ever had. I gave it three stars because it is fragile, but I would give customer service a five star. The repair and customer service is the only reason why this review is not a one star.",OK
I like but i insert my sim card and i get a sim card error,OK
It was a gift. But it doest really look like a galaxy its just weird,OK
"When I read the reviews before buying this phone, I did not mind what they all said aobut the short life of the battery, but now that I have it I can tell that they all told the truth. The phone is ok, in fact very good, it does all that is supposed to do, but the battery is a problem, you need to charge it every night, it starts draining as soon as you turn it on, all those apps to save battery don't really work or do very little, sorry SONY this is the truth!!!",OK
"I really liked this phone for my purposes when it arrived. I want to give it more stars, but it's not a regular Verizon network phone. It is apparently a prepaid phone incapable of normal activation on Verizon, unless it's especially set up to be used on the regular network [clearing the ESN and unlocking it for regular network use]. The seller didn't advise me it was a ""prepaid"" Verizon phone. So my experience is not really the fault of the phone as much as it's a dysfunctional seller. But I give this warning that a lot of these models are incapable of being used normally on Verizon unless unblocked and cleared first.",OK
I recieved my order in a timely manner. Although I received the wrong GB..I decided to keep it. overall I'm pleased,OK
"the only problem i have is that it freezes alot, but everything else works great especially my bbm messenger that's the reason i got it in the first place.",OK
"It's iPhone! So not much to say since it's always the same thing over and over. However, design like it's very attractive. If I could get rid of it I will and return to my 5s.Update 27.9.2016: So I finally got rid of this phone, the size wasn't working for me. It is just too big and feels un-natural for an iPhone‰ÛÜ, I'll pass. I went with the 6s instead",OK
"Nokia X3-02 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone, you've requested was not received in full compliance because i miss the charger, I can not say is that he was in the store buying because you might have missed where they brought because was open to receive it and the charger was missing .... so I agree with other cell and filled my expectations and I loved the product .....",OK
"Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated.",OK
"I have a problem with a phone, I'd like to write by mail. I received two phones, one is OK but the other has a problem, when I answer",OK
If I could find a case for this phone it would get all five stars.HHopefully soon they'll start making cases and wallets for Posh.,OK
For the price you can't beat. Processor slow at times. Battery drains fast. Otherwise excellent phone.,OK
The phone got to my home at the best time thank youBut I thought it was a good for as a gift but my wife did not no how to use itSo she will stay with her Samsung but you yuys are best,OK
"The cell phone was not unlocked, need to make an additional payment to a technician to unlock it without taking into account that the equipment is in very good condition",OK
"It's very nice, is good, but did not come unlocked or with other language options, only English, Mandarin and German. The camera is great. It's a bit expensive, is light.",OK
"Although this Verizon iPhone 4s is in great shape for a used one, I have not been able to use its international GSM capabilities abroad because has been blocked by Verizon with the complicity of Apple. The later does not unblock the iPhone without previous approval from Verizon; and Verizon does not unblock the international GSM capabilities of this units unless the owner (me or anyone) is a Verizon customer in good standing for at least two months. Sound like a monopoly? Seems unfair? Sure it is! I call Verizon Global Services and they told me that story and said that I should try that Amazon Warehouse (the seller) unblock it on my behalf. I tried to make it work with Kolbi 3.5G Costa Rican network, using its SIM card, buy the cellphone keep on asking Verizon unlocking code...",OK
I have discovered they do not make Apple products like they used to...the top button locked up on the third day of having it.,OK
"I was looking for a phone with a real keyboard that I could use in both Israel and the United States and that was not very expensive. I read reviews before buying the phone several months ago, and they were overall fairly positive. My comments about the phone: It works, but it's amazingly slow to respond. Half the time I tap an icon and nothing happens, so I keep tapping, and eventually there is a response. Other times I try to do something and I get an indication that the phone is working on processing my request, but it can't quite do it. For phone purposes I mainly use a ""dumbphone"" that I have had for probably over five years, and it works fine. I use the smartphone mainly to check my e-mail when I'm out of the house. Since low cost was one of my main considerations, I guess you could say that it's good enough. I wonder, though, whether if I'd spent another 30 dollars, I could have gotten a phone that is not pretty much a bad joke.",OK
"I really liked this phone, especially for the price point. The one major downer is that the camera on it is extremely horrible in low and bright light conditions. Images contained high contrast and dark shadows. It is pretty much unusable.I ended up returning it because of the camera :( - I really hope they improve the lens and sensor for future products. If they did that, i would buy again from them.",OK
"This phone is nice the only problem it said it was unlocked, but its not please make sure its unlocked before you get itåÊNokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS Navigation, Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--with Warranty (Gray)",OK
But i have problem because the item is not unlock I put my Sim card and this no work an the pen is no good because no go in said,OK
I purchased the phone because it was supposedly unlocked and to my dismay it wasn't. I had to spend an additional amount to unlock the phone. I am disappointed.,OK
The phone turned on and worked but kept wanting to reboot. When it rebooted we lost all contacts. This happened several times so we called Tmobile. Tmobile informed us that this phone will not work properly anymore on their current system. Check first with your carrier!,OK
"It's a good cell phone overall but the description says that it has a PowerVR G6430 for graphics, and it has adreno 405. And the processor, being an Snap Dragon 615 only goes up to 1.5 Ghz instead of the announced 1.7. I guess you get what you paid for.",OK
Had to return this refurbished phone and learned my lesson. Better to pay the few dollars extra and buy a new one. Nothing worked right so I can't really review it. I didn't buy a new one I got a different one.,OK
"So first off I'd like to start by saying I am a long time android fan I have owned the following phoneGalaxy s4,s5,s6Galaxy Note 4Galaxy Note 5LG g2LG get flex 2Motor x pure 2015HTC one m7HTC desire 816HTC desire 601One plus oneMoto gNexus 6pI picked up the grey titanium note 5 as a replacement to my nexus 6p and so far so good 4g lte DOES work in us on t-mobile which was a concern of mine but one of the big features I was looking forward to using on my note 5 was samsung pay unfortunately it doesn't work on international models don't know why but it doesn't. It won't even let you download the app also the charger that came with the phone is not usa standard which makes it useless for me luckily I contacted the seller and she shipped a us version to me the phone is overall a great phone besides those 2 problems I may return it tho I'm gonna use it for a few weeks to see if holds up if not I'll just spend the extra 150 and get a s7 edge",OK
"As far as protecting your phone, Otterbox definitely delivers. It's sturdy, and the case offers screen protection too. Unfortunately, the piece of plastic that goes over the screen doesn't lay flat against the screen, so I have to press really hard any time I'm typing or using Swype, which makes it a lot more difficult. Also, dust and dirt get behind the screen protector pretty easily, so I have to remove it fairly often for cleaning.The case shows dirt and sweat pretty easily also, and the almost sticky texture makes it difficult to slide in and out of pockets.",OK
"I really, really wanted to like this phone. It was the perfect balance of specs without being a phablet like every phone is now. If I had written this review earlier, it would've gotten 5 stars, but, that was before....the phone slid off a chair seat 2' from the floor and completely bricked. Normally, I'd do some quick repairs, but Sony phones are a bit unforgiving in this department (have to heat the glue, etc).Moved to the OnePlus 3 and I'm not looking back. I admit, I was a Sony fanboy, but the water-resistance isn't enough to warrant the price or the apparent frailty of the device.",OK
the phone is fine but the screen has already cracked and don't know how to contact anyone to take advantage of 60day warranty-typical,OK
"Ever since I have had the Note 4, I experience random crashes and rebooting. It does not matter what time of day or what application I am using. It crashes and automatically reboots. Since I am in IT I have waited patiently for a firmware fix. I figured there had to be one. After more than 6 months I have not been able to find a fix!.Has anyone else had this problem? If so, were you able to fix?",OK
"The article is what I expected okay, I agree with the purchase and I'm still looking good phone since I just got",OK
its a cool phone like a little mini computer on the go not bad definitly underated though just give it a chance,OK
"The case works great, but it is not the color it was supposed to be. I was expecting a blue and green case, but what I got was teal and grey. Had I know this was not going to be the color listed, I would not have purchased.",OK
"Though I think it is a nice easy to navigate phone and has good features, like voicemail preview, and large easy to see phone numbers it has an annoying habit of redialing numbers unless you are very careful and remember to hit the ""home"" button immediately after ""ending"" a call. The volume on calls could also be better for those in loud environments.",OK
"Phone is ok, battery may need to change because it shuts down sometimes after it falls below 20%",OK
I purchased a few of these phones before I finally went to a smart phone. The nokia 301.2 is a great basic phone. Easy to use and very durable.,OK
"It is good, but the problem is this phone dose not support arabic language in SMS messages.",OK
"Pros:Note has great screen, really nice colors, Super Amoled really shows off the difference. Phone is great for those people who want something between the regular smartphone and a small tablet. Battery can last one day of moderate usage.Cons:Software that came pre-installed is awful. Note is lagging, constantly running out of memory, applications randomly closing or taking MINUTES to start up (yes, minutes). I would try some custom roms.",OK
there is something is not working and it has to be when i need refund or some like that. thank you,OK
"What did you expect for $30? Yes it's slow, it has minimal storage, barely enough for on board apps.But hey, it's damn CHEAP.The only unexpected thing is that it is listed as having GPS, both in the title and in the specs. Mine does not seem to have GPS, or the GPS is not activated.Would have been 4 or even 5 stars if the GPS was working. (And no, position augmented only by network and WiFi is NOT GPS!)",OK
"The camera is not as good as advertised, it overheats during call. It has rebooted itself with no reason. I'm disappointed about this phone.",OK
"For the price, you cant beat this phone. Release date of 1 july and was able to purchase the phone for 79.00 and you cant really beat that for the price of a 5.5 inch phone. The BIG disappointment is on its release date (1 July 2015) it was promised to be upgradeable to Lollipop. Well, a month an a half later .. still no upgrade, even though article published indicated the update was supposed to be around the 29 of July.. Still waiting, but not holding my breathe.",OK
"I just received my brand new phone Posh Mobile L700 White, I received it on time on Aug 6,'2016, the phone looked very nice like I wanted a tablet 7.0 inches had a few minor problems such problems were downloading the play Store applications, interfering with Google play services, the volume is kind of low and the speaker I added from the play store a Volume Booster Application and a Speaker Booster, now I am more confident with my phone and working hopefully without a problem",OK
"Very cute, however, one of the hands popped off, but for the price I'm not upset.",OK
"Enjoyed it is a very good handset with amazing features, but could improve by incorporating metal parts like the iphone.",OK
Bought it for my girlfriend and no matter what we do we can't get the bubbles off the screen? I've tried everything and look up different methods and nothing seems to get them out..,OK
"Get this phone if you care about the quality of your photos. The camera is absolutely ON POINT. The pictures it takes looks better than it actually does in real life..no joke. The detail is crazy, even in low light environments...and also the speaker is loud, it rivals the iphone6 as far volume goes. Other than that, it's just another Galaxy. It has a fingerprint scanner..",OK
Phone is fine. Has a glitch in that there is a red strip across the top with number and letter codes. No one can figure out what it is (including phone personnel).,OK
"The phone itself was ok. I give only two stars because I had a difficult time getting it activated, it still isn't recognizing my sim. I don't like that Windows phone is not compatible with like any apps! But the phones were pretty and we we're excited to receive them and they weren't damaged",OK
"I got this phone just for temporary use and it's not that bad. Samsung phones however, are low quality phones in general but I was hoping that this one wouldn't be as bad, but it is. The call reception is horrible, whenever if call someone they can never understand what I'm saying. The camera quality is horrible. All my pictures looks extremely blurry and the seller states that this phones has a front facing camera which is completely bogus. And it also doesn't have flash. Another major downfall to this phone was that it didn't come with an SD card so I have to spend more money which was really annoying. Aside from the phone not being as good as I hoped, the seller was able to make my phone arrive in 3 days which was 4 days sooner than when I thought it was going to arrive.",OK
I wish I can give five stars in the beginning but after few months to use the battery doesn't keep long and the picture color doesn't showing good either. I don't know why that happened. I feel very disappointed.,OK
I feel like the charge I get off of this lasts like the charges you get off of a car or battery pack. My charging port is faulty so I can't use a regular charger any more. The best bet with this device is to drain your battery and charge completely while the device is off. Partial charges are next to useless.,OK
"Not bad. It was missing the cover to the USB port, and the port itself is in need of replacement.",OK
"It doesn't work with Movistar of Argentina, I had to change the line to claro and it works great. Very good mobile. No 5 stars though movistar issue.",OK
"This is a nice phone. The camera is simply the best available on any phone. And I love that it is logical and very easy to use The quality is on par with the iPhone and is better than any Android I have ever used in spite of its faults. It does get very hot around the camera, and the quality of the apps is far behind ios and Adriod, but slowing improving. I would also like to have a quick dock like ios and Andriod. Hoping Windows phone 10 will address that. Three stars due to the quality of apps.",OK
"Very disappointed! I ordered this phone for my Mom as a Christmas present. I decided a few days ago to actually charge it and make sure it was okay so it would be ready for use on Christmas Day and to my surprise the back panel that covers the battery compartment was not only a different shade of pink but it also does not fit flush with the rest of the phone, almost as though it were for a different model. So my question is Did I really get a new phone? Apart from that if I return it I can only get a refund as the item is out of stock. With Christmas a few weeks away I am really disappointed that this is the case and quite frankly don't know what to do now because ordering a different phone might be too risky in terms of the timeframe for delivery. I think, as a good customer the least Amazon should do is find the right part and send it to me free of charge so my Mom can have a great surprise this Christmas.",OK
I looked up the web site and had great difficulty locating this model. I have yet to locate instructions for use such as : Where is the keypad for the telephone? It show 3 choices: Language: English; accessories for the disabled; and an emergency dialing pad that will not accept any number.This is extremely frustrating.,OK
Not exactly what i expected had a lot of storage which is good but isn't so fast and the camera that i thought would be good isn't so great i think i will keep this phone because of the storage though will update the review if anymore issues occur,OK
Decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it 5 stars,OK
"It's a basic phone that does what I need it for although one of the SIM slots is not working properly which is not a problem given that I have only one number so I just use the other available one. So far, I have yet to fully explore it, but from what I have found, it does seem to lack certain features that I had in another phone that I previously owned, but that's a minor issue because i think this phone is still okay for what I paid.",OK
"Was well loved, but developed issues over time. The screen started to show some discoloration with the pixels, couldn't connect to bluetooth and had trouble with the battery staying charged. other than those issues, phone worked well.",OK
Well absolutely it's good for the price but i dont know why 3g conecction doesnt work... I try everything but nothing some people told me is because it's unlocked version but i really dont know.... another thing it's came with preinstaller aplications by telstra... I looked around and its a operators in australia so that makes me think that cellphone is from there.... so dissaponted... But everything it's ok for the price,OK
Phone works great one major drawback is you don't hear clearly unless you use the earpieces.,OK
"I do not feel the case is high enough and the phone seems it might slip out or, if dropped on the face, would crack because there is not a high enough ridge around the edge to protect it like other cases.",OK
It's OK for the price.... buttons have to be hit a couple of times to get things to come up.,OK
"The shipping was rather quick (though I did pay extra for expedited), it came in a padded envelope rather than a box and without the IPhone box itself (which i don't understand as the item is listed as brand new) in addition with a charger stuffed in there, both the cable and solid wall charger which could have ended up badly. A bit more caution should have been taken in my opinion. The listing also said ""accessories"" which was false as the headphone that come with the phone were not included costing me another $32 after tax. However, when I received the phone all things seem in working order and had no issue activating it with my Verizon carrier. So far it seems to be in flawless condition visually and operationally. I shall update if anything happens with in. All and all I am happy with my purchase and will consider buying from this seller again.",OK
"The product does not arrive on time, and it was locked in the description that said it was unlocked.For the rest everything was fine",OK
"I plan to return this item because, shortly after received, the navegation ball did not work well. I do not know what caused this nor do I know if the item was actually a refurbished instead of a new one as I had ordered.",OK
"I received a Used item instead of a New one. The nylon back had dust and dirt stains, which I had to remove with spirit. The plastic frame of the phone has scratches and scuffs particularly around headphones jack and USB port. The power button and volume rocker also have sign of wear.The screen looks like new with no even little scratches. Other than the problems described above, everything works fine, no problems with speaker or microphone. Still I expect a Certified Refurbished item to meet higher standards or at least the description provided on the page.",OK
"I agree with ""Andy"", the C1-01 is a good basic phone. I bought this phone in 2011 for $49.99, it is $10 more now (2012). The battery seems to last a very long time. The phone has a minimal camera, but do not expect to take detailed photos - the result is very ""grainy"". In sum, a reliable, compact, and dependable phone with a relatively long battery life.",OK
i prefer Blackberry's button keyboards than touch screen keyboards. This phone works as expected. The only complaint i have is the battery that comes with the phone is a cheap battery and does not hold a charge for very long.,OK
"Product was a lot larger than it appeared to be, the touch screen is not as sensitive nevertheless great product",OK
The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it.,OK
Phone has to be reset at least once a week to continue to connect to WiFi. Also tends to freeze at times. Definitely not new as advertised,OK
"When I ordered the phone, it said it was new. I expected to see the owners manual book inside the box, but it was not there. The volume on the phone is not loud enough, so when it rings from distance, it can't be heard. The part where it charges it's not sturdy enough, you have to be careful not to pull it too hard or it will break.",OK
"Purchased 2 phones to bring back with me to Nigeria for use there. One phone had numbers stored in it, soit was not new as advertised. The other phone had a used battery. Advertising fraud???? Will not purchasefrom this vendor again.",OK
Ordered this for overseas. Havn't tried it yet but will give it a review when I sim card it soon.,OK
"The phone is fine. However I am displeased with amazons marketing of this phone. The phone was not ""unlocked"" as the title states. When I brought this up with seller he stated that Amazon inserted this I to the title, not himself.I feel items in bold print in the title should be accurate. I had to spend additional time and money to unlock the phone for global use.",OK
"its a powerfull phone, but it heated too much and its battery life its not exceptional",OK
"Overall the phone is good, but there are some features that I do not like about it. There is no radio application on it, I tried to download the application but it needs internet connection all the time. I recommend this phone for those who don't care about listening to the radio .....",OK
"The phone works like it should. But Verizon, won't let me have E-Mail or Internet on the new phone. Also had a big problem getting all my contacts transferred into the new phone. Memory card didn't work. No sim card !!",OK
"I bought it I9505 from Hasscellfree a week ago, used in T-mobile. 3G (H+) network is pretty good.However, I just discovered the MicorSD cards won't be read in this phone, while same cards work pretty good in other Galaxy S4 I borrowed for testing.Amazon has excellent service and allows me to return it. Wish me good luck next round. I actually love this phone beyond the defect...",OK
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",OK
Texts are late getting to me . Ring tone not very loud. I now wish I went with the other phone I was looking at,OK
Water resistant and works pretty good! Just isn't as user friendly as other androids on the market. Good for the price.,OK
Well I return the phone because the phone wasn't working very well. Don't expect me to give 4 or 5 stars for a phone that had an Issue.,OK
"The phone is working as it is expected, except the camera. Whenever I open the phone camera. It's all black. I'm still trying to figure out how to use the camera of this phone. The rest it's ok.",OK
"I'm hoping this time it will last,it is my 2nd time purchasing lumia,the ist time opnly lasted 3 mos.",OK
"It's a AT&T phone. I use it on cricket. Once I removed most of the bloatware of apps it is a decent phone. You definitely need a case, otherwise it is like trying to hold a wet bar of soap. Two complaints phantom operations, and too quick to flip to portrait mode. I actually prefer my windows phone.",OK
"Good, but i have a problem.. the internet have problems, dont charge something pages!and somethings apps stop running from not where",OK
"I can't recommend this phone highly enough. The unverified purchases bother me, as the phone is so nice that it sells itself, without the paid reviews. If you want a high quality phone that is mind blowing easy to use, then you will pick up this phone. I couldn't be happier. The price is excellent and the shipping was fast as well. It is a 5 star item, but I give it 3 stars due to the staged reviews. It is so blatant it is ridiculous!",OK
The product appears as the actual item but it's like a shaving of the phone material on top the phone and I can't take it off!! Also it didn't come come with the piece to open the micro chip.,OK
"the item arrived on time, however, I am disappointed by the product quality, as the phone looks like a child's toy. Also, it does not have a lock screen option.",OK
It is a good phone for its price range. I think of getting similar phone few weeks from now.Good service overall.,OK
Battery won't stay charged. They sent a new battery and still won't stay charged. They've offered to replace the phone but I have to send the phone back first. Well I don't have an extra phone to use so I'm stuck with a phone that won't stay charged. At least they tried,OK
"Beautiful little phone, but ""little"" is the key word - my fault, I should have never tried the ""candybar"" type. The phone worked ok, but didn't meet my need, which was to link it via bluetooth to my homecordless (bluetooth) dect-6.0 housephone...the bluetooth wasn't even close to compatible.",OK
"I ordered this to replace a generic belt clip on which the catch holding the belt clip open failed; thus, it wouldn't stand up. About a month after I ordered this genuine Otterbox at about 5 times the cost, that same catch broke. I've no ordered a third.",OK
"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased.",OK
how come It didn't come with everything It showed It didn't come with a charger please respond back I need a asnwer because It should of came with everything it showed,OK
"This was a replacement from Amazon for the original order a month before this. The first unit started giving voice trouble due to fault in the ear-phone jack. Continous use of corded ear-phone confuses the hardware even when the ear-phone cable is removed and then you cannot hear anything or the party at the other end hear you. Once you have this problem, the handset will only work with the corded earphone. Did some research on the web of Treo users and found it as a common problem.Moved to a bluetooth headset with the new instrument. Working well so far. The phone overall is good; but this hardware problem on a new phone is not acceptable and worthy of a brand like Palm.Amazon Service was great; the replacement was smooth; and customer service and user experience was what I tell my friends ""Amazing Amazon"".",OK
The phone works perfectly fine and it's in good conditions but the charger and the headphones were not original apple products.,OK
"The product was as advertized. It was a gift I bought for someone. So far, the person did not report any problems about the phone. I think it is a good buy.",OK
"The phone works ok, but sound quality is not very good, it sounds rather like holding a tin can up to your ear. The Wi-Fi connectivity is nice and works well, I've used it both at home and in a hotel room. The internet browser is surprisingly fast but the memory fills up very fast too, due to the small RAM. Bluetooth works well with my MacBook Pro for file transfers, both sending music to the phone memory card and sending photos/videos from the phone to the MacBook. The bluetooth also works in our 2011 Toyota Sienna, at least as far as making and receiving calls, but the stereo music features do not work at all. The camera is adequate but unimpressive and photos look grainy. The full keyboard while small is nice, although I do no texting and only very little emailing. It's also nice to be able to customize (some) button functions and on-screen shortcuts.",OK
"It does protect the tablet... so much that I can't get to it. When I have my tablet in this casing, I can't turn on and off my tablet. The ""power"" button does not reach the power button on the tablet when it is in the casing, so I have to take it out everytime. TOO INCONVENIENT and too cumbersome to have to remove the case everytime. I have sent it back.",OK
It required some work and a ATT SIM card to get it to work. As yet not connected to the internet.,OK
this phone does not hold a good battery charge and charges real slow if charged by computer the positive thing about this phone is it is rugged,OK
"This is a great device, however I wasn't advised because its UNLOCKED it wouldn't have great service because of this... other then that I love the phone, but I did return to my old phone, because of the service issues.",OK
Well the watch did what it was designed to do but I only had it for a week and I dropped it while putting it on and the glass shattered. I did think that it fell that hard on the ground thst it was cause the screen to crack but it is what it is. I contacted the seller and they are supposed to be sending me a replacement watch in the mail. I'll know more soon.,OK
"Great value. Really good phone unless you drop it...which you will, and there is no where to go to get it fixed. I ordered a new screen and digitizer which didn't work. So now I have a worthless hunk of plastic and metal.",OK
really heavy phone.. compared to my Samsung tablet.. it was big it didn't bother me but people always asking if I had a tablet or a phone so got tired of it... front camera was crappy back camera was good.. it wouldn't catch up when I was texting or the home button was on the screen so it was kind of annoying while texting it would bring me right back to the home page... love the color and the screen was hard... battery lasted a very long time.. worth the price kind of yes and no but I returned it before it got the 30 month gerent so now I ordered the blu vivo 5 I cant wait to receive it its amazing and that is worth its price.,OK
"I would like to exchange my cell phone, because my wifi doesn't work, but I am going back to Brazil next week. What can you do?",OK
The earpiece volume is quite low. And the ability to use the contact backup software is not possible due to the software was not 'wiped' by the previous owner.,OK
"I can t connect with the data mobile network.... In my country.....I bought this phone recently and its a great phone but i am not able to get my mobile data to work on it, i mean no internet unless i use wifi.Haiti",OK
"I received the phone in the proper time period. It was wrapped like new, however, after using the phone for just a couple weeks already the touch screen is not working well. This could certainly be a product defect, but seems funny since my other phone, the exact same model, worked fine for years. The bottom line - probably could have gotten a better deal from Verizon, but HATE Verizon and don't want to give them any more business than I absolutely have to.",OK
OK. Biggest benefits of these phones are dual sim and long battery life. Software is a bit dated now.,OK
"Seems like an awesome phone and would probably work great with Verizon but I bought it for straight talk since all the reviews said it would work..it does not work with straight talk, I tried every angle to get it to work with the service but refused to read the straight talk sim card.",OK
"It says in the description that 2 batteries were included, however the package came with only one battery. The manual is horrible, it did not tell how to install the sim card. You will need to go to youtube to find out how to do it. Otherwise, the phone is a simple cheap phone, it does what it does. So for the price, I will give 3 stars.",OK
"Shipped very fast.I received a unit that was listed as ""like new"". It was cosmetically almost perfect. However, the charge port was wobbly and positional. The software would never load. It got stuck and I could never initialize the phone. Sent it back.",OK
"Looks ok. Haven't used it, found old phone. Don't know why you need more words in response. It's a phone, big deal.",OK
"hello, the phone is locked when you turn the phone tells me locked subcidio code, I could use it on any carrier here in Venezuela",OK
"The battery does not last long at all, but it is cheap so deal with it!",OK
phone does not work from front screen but worth it as a quick replacement for my grandson's other phone. acceptable.,OK
I was happy to receive the phone . I am not happy that it is not rooted,OK
"So far (3 weeks), the phone had been great.I thought at the time I ordered this Mussel was 32gb internal storage, but it was only 16.The phone this replaced was the galaxy nexus, which was more durable. The S3 seems to Come with Samsung & Verizon bloatware (or google bloatware, depending on how you look at it). It's unclear which apps are superior (without using them all) and many cannot be removed.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, but based on experience with the galaxy nexus, internet research, and the sellers description, I expected more from the device.",OK
"it was entire open, need another operation to get it to adjust to our system here in Jamaica. Otherwise it was ok",OK
"Bought for my wife, and it did an okay job, but screen still shattered in case. I've used other otterbox cases and they were great.",OK
"Watch out, the European version of this phone has newer software and a better updates support. US version has old software without ability of upgrade.I was disappointed because you can not use Google talk and other IM services in chat, as it was stated, except ovi chat...I am returning this product...From the other side it looks very nice, and it is a very elegant device...",OK
"I had one of these originally from Verizon and it last wonderfully for years before wearing out. Small and basic for my needs I decided to get another ""new"" old stock from amazon. The new one I received was crap and lasted barely 6 weeks. So I must have gotten a lemon or something from my seller because I know this phone does better than that.",OK
Is not unlocked. Works fine in the US not international. GSM GLOBAL UNLOCKED is supoosed to do so. Had to pay to unlock the phone since is going to be use as a travel phone,OK
"I loved this phone...for the brief time that I had it in my possession. Can't beat the price for what you get, the speed was great and the screen was very beautiful. Sadly, one week into ownership I was hit with the dreaded ""permanent restart"" bug that I've heard of other phone owners experiencing. It made the phone restart one time after another until the battery was dead. I hoped that that might reset it, but when I plugged it back in there was no fix. I had to return it and now I have a Moto G LTE, which works great. No bugs. I was using the T-Mobile LTE network in the Memphis, TN area and I always got reliable, fast downloads.This is a great phone if you want to be aware of the bugs you might experience. I will allow that I may have gotten the one faulty unit our of a production volume of several thousand, but it put a bad taste in my mouth, which is why I went with the Moto G LTE.",OK
"This phone allows the person to roam the internet but they cannot download anything from the internet. I had brought this phone to download from the internet, apps, in order to talk with my fiance outside of America. This phone doesn't allow anyone to do anything like that. The phone doesn't come unlocked as well. So, if anyone wants an unlocked phone, this is not the phone for you. The phone looks new, and it has a great battery life. Speaking about batteries, it doesn't come with one, nor does it come with a 'Sim' and 'memory card' for that matter. The person has to buy those things before even using the product. Other than that, it is a great phone.",OK
"works well but it is just for emergencies! Thought I could use withmy current contract but Verizon‰ÛÜ would not allow that,",OK
"Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store.",OK
"E'max is what I expected it to be, a no frills basic phone. I have had no problems with it.",OK
The Product is good but my battery isnt no good it charge 100% and then go dead when i take it off the charger,OK
Was a very good phone for aBout 3 months loved it but now the screen never wants to pick up touch its really a pain now . I guess that's what u End up with when u buy a refurbished Phone,OK
"Was not told it was an at&t phone, my sim card would not fit in it. Not compatiblecompatible with t-mobile or Wal-Mart's family service, just at&t.",OK
Battery connector is f**** up but I love the phone and will be having it fixed since its too late to return it. The company Noah's gave me every taip too fix battery draining problems but its the connector not cord or battery.,OK
"phone is slow make no mistake u will be dealing with a slow phone and buggy o brought this cause the screen size nice looking phone don't get me wrong but the fact is so slow, buggy,and something that bothers me no message light on phone when u get a message keyboard for texting buggy also and when watching a movie black levels on phone worst i ever seen black grays light grays washed together to get a picture that looks horrible battery forget about it if i run it on bare bones meaning turned everything off or brightness down internet turned off turn everything off that sucks juice ur lucky it last 8 hours but hey i like the screen size that's really about it",OK
Regretfully the phone was beautiful but I needed a Verizon carrier phone and when we opened up the Sim card we found out it was AT&T and we couldn't make it work it was returned as per instructions and Amazon refunded my money immediately.,OK
It had several deep scratches that I wish I had known about before purchasing phone was not happy about that but everything else okay,OK
"Bought used via Amazon vendor. Nice pocket phone for shop and outdoor work. Mine was soft-wired for AT&T so it worked on T-Mobile but most apps were useless but since there's no keyboard, it doesn't really matter.",OK
"About what I expected for the money. Doesn't shut off phone when it is placed inside like OEM, and a little flimsy on the clip, but it was cheap.",OK
I bought this Samsung i8910 Omnia HD and so far I like it but no too much because it has some few issue to deal with and I guess its because it was not made to work with the USA network,OK
I payed for an unlocked cellphone which was not. I was very disappointed that i had to spend extra money in my country to unlock the phone especially since i bought it as a birthday gift for myself.,OK
"smallest keys I have ever seen, basically impossible to type doesn't mention sim card type, takes a large sim card might need to buy a sim adapter",OK
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",OK
"Overall I would give this phone 3 stars. Unfortunately it would turn off by itself constantly even when the battery was fully charged. The only way that I could get it back on would be to remove and then reinsert the battery. The touchscreen would freeze several times daily which also could only be resolved by removing and then reinserting the battery. This phone has excellent features but crashes way too often and by that I mean DAILY! If it weren't for those issues, I would've been very pleased with this phone. Overall, most other functions worked well.",OK
"This phone overheats very rapidly when you have a case on it. I had to take the case off in order to use it. Also, I have had to remove the SIMM card several times to reset the phone. I contacted my carrier and it is not a carrier issue. I think it is do to the over-heating issue.",OK
"The overall functions and durability of the phone are fine. It has a loud ringer. At times it is hard to hear a caller when ear is up against phone. Big reason I'm giving this a lower rating is that the keys on the phone are to small and often when pressing one button, my fingers land on two. The button are hard to see. At night the buttons light up AFTER you touch one button. I have dropped the phone several times and it works just fine. This phone was not bought for internet use. Make sure to keep that in mind.",OK
"It is first gen, not series 1, which I kind of assumed before I purchased, but being the impulsive individual that I am, I decided to just do it anyway. It works fine, it is a little slow and the battery life kind of sucks. I am returning it and buying the apple watch series 1 directly from apple. It is literally $40 more.... Do yourself a favor and please just buy it from apple. This is absolutely not worth it... Literally a $40 difference from a brand new one with a better processor...",OK
I bought two and one did not work. The Airtell office in India said that the phone was defective. The other one worked well and i was able to use the sim card I had bought for the first one on the second one. I would like to return the defective one.,OK
"the sound from the speaker is horrible, as well as the sound from your voice trought the microphone, the strenght of the antenna is weak I don't have reception in my house, as I just to have with my samsung s4",OK
"its an okay phone, It just doesn't fit my style for a phone I would like. If you like the full touch screen and are a slower texter then I would recommend this phone. If all you do is text, this phone is not for you.",OK
"After lightly using it for a month, the screen started to bug out - the screen was flipped both horizontally and vertically (so that it was mirrored), there were colors everywhere (on the phone, I'm not talking about acid), and so the phone was not usable anymore. I'm assuming it was the digitizer, but I have no clue what caused it to break. If that hadn't happened, it would've been a great phone. Solid camera, speedy, it feels good to hold, and looks beautiful.",OK
This is probably a phone that was used very hard before. When we started it up it only worked for 1 day with out problems. It has only been used for 2 weeks and it is already time to get another phone.,OK
"This is a versatile basic phone. Although, it is not advanced in the ""IPhone"" tradition, it has it's own usefulness. I'm still investigating it......",OK
"Actually this product doesn't have camera of 3.2 MP, it is actually 3.0 Mp also it's touch system is very slow as compared to other touch phones. But it's camera operates well , also sound system and screen resolution is good but i will recommend you to spent your money on any other cell phone instead this.",OK
"I had to set the network a couple of times, it worked out well in the end. I like the phone; and the delivery time was great.",OK
"bought one for my mom, she's a basic user so i decided for an L7, anyway, at first sight feels heavy when you look at the animations and transitions, i had to install kitkat 4.4 custom ROM to give it back some free space and remove bloatware, even facebook put L7 slow so thats why i decided to do that",OK
"the phone is pretty neat. does not have some features i personally like and will keep it for a back up phone. so as always, ROCK ON :))",OK
The phone does not hold a charge for very long and shuts off when it at 50% charge.,OK
The power off button never worked. Needed the phone so we kept it but had to use the accessibility features to power off and cut the screen off,OK
The software is somewhat very hard to use by comparing to any other brands. It is cumbersome to use.,OK
Purchased 2 phones for 2 friends that live out of country. One phones camera didn't work at all....that's what ya get you buy on the Internet!!! Never again.,OK
Phone is great. And in was absolutely happy to have it for two months after the purchase. Because suddenly it stopped charging. Just stays plugged in all the time and barely half battery. No answers online for this specific model what is the reason and how to fix it.But after I read more apparently its a comment issue with this line. Previous models have the same issue.,OK
Phone works great except when I was texted a picture it locked up totÌÊlly. Finally shut it down and when it came back up it was operating correctly. Haven't taken a chance of opening anymore texts with photos.,OK
"Nice, looks like new...but after few months of used, it started turning off when battery was low 21%, so I went back to my old samsung galaxy J7 and so I put away in my dresser drawer.",OK
"battery lost connection frequently. (purchased for father, and he ended up smashing it, since it would shut off mid phone call.",OK
"It's been 8 months since I bought the Milestone. Recently it received it's Froyo(Android 2.2) upgrade. The phone is heavier than your average phone and is more solidly built. The screen has a nice resolution and is sufficiently responsive. The processor, though, is not quite fast enough. On many an occassion the milestone crashes when loading heavy apps like Maps or Latitude. The sluggishness in general usage is easily visible, especially when compared to the new and cheaper alternatives. The camera works fine - takes OK pics and decent videos. The bluetooth and wifi work as expected. GPS and AGPS works pretty well. Keyboard is useful, but takes some getting used to.To sum things up, you're better off now buying a different phone. You'll get phones which performs better at a lower price. Or maybe you could get the newer Milestones.",OK
"Phone has quite a few dings and scratches. I've never encountered a charger as cheap of quality as the one included. Not surprised it didn't work. Battery is junk, will only hold a charge for a few hours even when phone isn't being actively used. Full of Verison bloatware, and the first time when I inserted a new AT&T sim-card it wouldn't allow me to activate service, but oddly after restarting the phone it worked.",OK
"DID not work well with My T- Mobile service.. had spotty service if At all... and constantly locked up thinking about the next process...I returned within 30 Days of Reciept, after having tried to work with it and finally gave up...",OK
"like phone, but hard to text.keys are tiny.packed and shipped well.no scratches.adds are annoying a pain.otherwise like phone for use",OK
I had issues with Google Play which wasn't working out of the box but I got it fixed. other than that it's all good,OK
"The back piece did not fit the phone properly, nor did another brand new one I got from wireless toyz. The reason they're selling them is because the dimensions on the phone are off by a tiny bit. It must be some kind of defect. The phone did work all in all how it should, and it arrived cosmetically flawless. But compared to my Galaxy S2 Epic 4G touch, the processor was extremely slow. But that is probably just because it is an older phone.",OK
"At first I was very happy with this phone. Now, not as much. I find that it will periodically lose the signal and I will have to remove the battery to 'reboot' the system. This is really annoying when it happens in the middle of a call. I do believe that I will be replacing it soon and not with another HP product.",OK
"I don't like it much because the case doesn't cover the inside corners very much, the phone fell and a little bit of the corner chipped. I had to buy another case.",OK
"Overall it's a great phone, works well like any android phone. (All of the advantages which i agree with are already written in previous reviews)I did have a little trouble getting used to a few annoying stuff, for example: I rearranged my photos in new folders using my phone, and then later i attached my phone to my computer, and all of the folders I created were gone, only the ones i had originally put on my phone through my computer were there. In addition to that, every time i go into my photo library i see all of my photos on my phone unorganized, and i have to click on view in folders every time. One last thing is I highly recommend you apply a glass screen protector immediately as you receive your phone. I only applied the regular screen protector I had received with the phone, and 2 weeks after using it, the screen cracked at the top (no idea how it happened), and then I couldn't use the screen at all above the crack.",OK
this phone is annoying sometimes when it freezes. you need to wait 1 to 2 minutes to wait it wake up.,OK
I bought this phone specifically for travel out of the US. The camera quality sucks but it served its purpose for my trip to France.,OK
"The trackpad was slow to respond to my movements, but I suppose I get what I pay for. It served its purpose.",OK
So bought this iPhone 3GS the only thing that sucked was the home button it was had to push deeper glass had some scratches but it was still worked great glass it did not have any glass cracks before had iPod touch 4g do not see much slowness but my power button on iPod touch got stuck so this why i got a iPhone also needed a phone,OK
I was happy when i received my package from the mail. The box and its content came in an excellent condition. Though I was quite disappointed on how long it took to reach i'm still happy i got it.,OK
I can't enjoy 4g LTE... Not even 3g. Only 2g. I'm gonna try with another operator and see,OK
Be aware ti buying White color i recomend The black color because it is so hard to clean the white rubber and I tried to brush it with toothbrush every week,OK
My daughter ordered it and did not read that it was not compatible for Verizon. We had to go to AT&T. They said they had never seen this phone before but were able to connect with it. Theorize that this phone is more compatible for wireless down south?,OK
"Good phone. Works with tmobile but only gets 3g. Apparently, it does receive 4G but only with Verizon. I felt a little cheated on since i thought i would be able to get 4g with any carrier, but my dad likes the phone.",OK
"If you've owned an iPhone 4/4s, it's about the same size as that. Very slippery too. Battery life is amazing and I've been using my phone consistently since I purchased it in May 2015. No issues taking it underwater so far.But I would still recommend the full size over this. At this day and age, the full size just feels right in your hand and doesn't feel outdated. But for what it is meant for, I guess it's pretty awesome",OK
"This phone is pretty decent but as one other reviewer said, the screen dims after about 10 seconds automatically. It doesn't shut off, just dims. When you are reading or doing things it is really annoying. I find myself having to touch the screen somewhere to get the screen to come back up to full brightness, and then I sometimes hit an icon and it launches something that I did not want. As far as I can tell there is no way to change this, and so far no apps I have downloaded have been able to correct it. If this can't be fixed I will probably return it. I have an email in to Bluproducts to see if they have a fix for it.",OK
"There is no WIFI calling. I called Moto Support and they told me to use Hangouts. I then asked how I get calls in a building where i don't get service and have wifi, they said to tell people to call your hangout instead of your cellular number.",OK
"I brought it to Argentina, where I live. I was displeased to find out that in this country it is not a 4G LTE cell phone. Instead, I should have bought Sony Xperia Z3 D5803. I am disappointed.",OK
It's ok but not same quality as Otto. The clip stays on your belt but seems loose and phone turns.,OK
"I love how this cover protects my phone!! however the front ""clear"" part of the phone is not very clear I would have returned it except that I really do love the back side color of the phone and the overall protection it gives",OK
"This phone is ok, but I can not get apps, I can not play games, I can not get the weather reports for the day, I can not get my wifi hot spot in order to use my work IPAD which is a must. I had to give this phone away.I need to ask about my black berry bold 9930 that I ordered and have not received",OK
Screen color features are good for the price. But the phone lacks behind for the basic features. The mic quality is very poor. You have to speak real loud or use speaker to talk. Secondly the camera is slow and colors affect is different. It will always show glaze on face.,OK
Bought this to replace a broken Sony M2. This is an International Version. No a US version. Some of the Apps are different.,OK
I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas..I like it so much that I am thinking of getting the same one in pink..The phone works with t-mobile sim cards and is very easy to use..I like the touch screen and apps...It is a great phone..,OK
This phone was okay for awhile. It's nice if you like the actual keyboard instead of the virtual one.,OK
Not all of the Nexus 5 accessories were provided.It came only with a charger and USB cable.,OK
This wasn't the highest end phone of its time so not much to complain about. It came unlocked as stated and worked well out of the box without issues here in Ghana.,OK
"It's a nice phone, but had a hard time getting phone service. At&t,Verizon,Sprint, Cricket, PureTalk all said the phone is incompatible with their service. Finally got T-Mobile to accept it.",OK
"I purchased this phone and I received it in great condition. The plastic was on both screens, the keys, and the camera. The shipping was also fast. I am only giving this product 3 stars bc the slot for the sd card is not reading the card which is a major part of the phone. I am coming from a Droid Smartphone and would recommend this phone to anyone who wanted a basic phone",OK
"this is probably not an optimal choice in a ""fast phone which is still a phone size"" department, but it is still a good phone. I would rate it more stars if I were younger and the absence of sd slot and removable battery wouldn't matter. replaceable battery, by the way, would've really useful for a phone with such a poor battery life.",OK
"Everything is good , but 1 major problem is sound is very low. We can't hear. This very problem for everyone .",OK
"I use this an a media player without a sim card (so I do not have phone functions). The screen has a strange green tint to it noticeable on grays. I use four apps on it commonly: PocketCasts, Google Play Music, Audible, and YouTube Music. This device does not have the specs that the newest versions of these apps without problems.",OK
"The keyboard was much too small to be effective for someone with adult sized fingers. This was one of the main features I was looking for, and was a dissapointment.",OK
"I love the phone and the ads are not intrusive, but it comes with a boatload of Amazon bloatware - Amazon drive, Amazon Photos, Kindle, Amazon Music - these apps cannot be uninstalled or disabled - I don't want Amazon storing my photos in the cloud or showing up in their photo app. I love my Kindle reader, but I don't want the app on my phone.",OK
I ordered this phone on 24 February 2011 and have not recieved it yet! It is March 10th!!!!! *Officially P-d*,OK
"This phone was LOCKED although listed as ""Unlocked"" so because i needed a phone asap I had to pay a local place to unlocked it for me. Also it was advertised as new, when it wasn't. I found that you can check to see how much air time has been used prior to me purchasing it so nope, it was not new. Again, I did not wanna go through the hassle of being without a phone for another week or longer so i kept it. Works okay, just not cool with the false info in advertising. If I wanted a used one, I would've bought a used one.",OK
"it is quite normal. it gets stuck sometimes. One of the phones cannot be used because it came badly unlocked in chinese, and does not allow access to the playstore",OK
Good protection against drops however the plastic cover over the glass cause a delay in swiping on the screen and the power button and volume buttons are hard to press... An opening the case was very difficult.... Start of with the pieces that pull up like the headphones cover,OK
Face is pretty large and band is pretty small. All functions seem to work ok. Needs to be charged about every 12 hours with regular use.,OK
"This is a good phone for the money. That being said, the touch screen required me to press down fairly hard on it and doesn't always work right/sense my fingers. The onscreen keyboard is difficult to type on because of this. The screen is bright and vibrant and the camera works as expected. The vibrator doesn't vibrate like a normal phone and seems cheap and cheesy. Lollipop to me is a disaster. Very counterproductive. To anybody getting this phone, I would recommend you switch to KitKat or something else if you can.",OK
"The nokia applications are great as always but Windows phone doesn't allow me to link my work email to this phone, also every time you need to fix something you need to reset to original settings and ask for the place where the phone was first registered (which in this case was Germany). So I'm reselling it and going back to my old phone",OK
The only complaint I have is that it does NOT seem to hold a charge very well. It'll be fully charged in the morning but completely dead by 3 or 4 in the afternoon.,OK
The phone looked okay BUT i was grossly disappointed that it did not have a camera. I guess i will look harder at the features next time( i need a good one for ME),OK
"An excellent phone. Just be aware that it does not work on 4g LTE, like its USA counterpart, just on 3g. If you usr a lot of Wi-Fi, like me, you will enjoy the power and speed of this phone, at a price $100 lower.",OK
"My husband bought me this phone to replace my broken phone . The best part of thisphone for me, was there was no learning curve since it was just like the one I had previously. If you don't care about all the Iphone hype and just want a phone that will get the job done, this one fits the bill.",OK
Do not forget that any previous BIS/BES data account you may had with your previous BB device is not valid any more!! BB10 devices are not working under BIS/BES protocol anymore. Same Android data account may apply.,OK
Memmory card fills up and phone doesn't let you know; so when I took Pictures they never saved but said they did. Online doesn't work very well either.,OK
"Hi My name is M.W. I purchased a LG VS660 Vortex Cell Phone, Android Touch Screen.the battery does not hold a charge I charged the battery full did not speak nor email or text to much half way through day needed to be recharged. The battery does not look new. I'm also having a problem that the phone pairs with my parrot Bluetooth however when i make a phone call it shuts off.",OK
"I been using this phone in replacement of my issued phone, being an unlocked phone, I was able to use the sim from my regular phone and get to load a whole lot of music, with the memory card capacity that i can usefor this phone, its just awesome. great for loading short movies to my 8gig card. thanks...",OK
I love the handset. Very premium looking phone. Unfortunately I had to return it. The handset gets too hot from the bottom edge of right side.It also wont support 4g LTE signals in US. otherwise I love this phone.,OK
"I bought this phone as a stop gap between contract phones.I usually make it through a contract but my HTC Inspire just suddenly stopped working...13 months in...too late for warranty.Nice features, although only 3G I though I could handle a little slower speed for 6 months...WIRELESS CONNECTION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AT&T SYSTEM. Works as a phone and when wi-fi is available but that's it.I'm switching to T-Moble anyhow so we'll see...maybe it will work there.",OK
"No scratches on the glass and worked nearly as described, except the headphone jack is broken -- which is a real bummer. The apple store will only replace the phone for as much as I already paid for it or I have the option of fixing it myself, which really is not what I want to do. I'm too nervous about doing further damage inside. I guess this is what I get for buying a used phone. Other than that, it works perfectly and arrived quickly.",OK
The manual indicates product comes with 16GB internal memory. I can only find 1.6GB. Downloaded DiskUsage app which indicates the same. Product info on amazon site states 4GB internal memory and 512MB RAM.Customer service says to contact Samsung directly. Will update the review once I get time to contact Samsung.,OK
"As for the phone and seller it was great. Phone was new and no hassle. If I knew what jailbroke meant I would of looked for one that has been. I can't download any apps or do anything other then make calls, pictures and music. I can get online bit it won't hold any apps because Apple doesn't update the iPhone 3 anymore and it complete crap. I haven't been able to jailbreak it yet.",OK
it was hard to figure out had to have my daughter set up some functions on it,OK
"Beautiful phone but it is slow because the memory is unexpandable. Otherwise, it rivals the competitors in terms of how itnis made...",OK
I love this phone since I have had one for at least 4 years but the one I received was defective and sent it back,OK
"Worked fine for 1 month, after that, got stuck in the BLU logo and that's it. Sad :/",OK
dont use as a phone no apps no pics all it can do is look cool call and text and be a ipod THATS IT good i pod tho,OK
"I bought the phone because I was led to belive that it could handle WiFi calling. Not true, unless you have a carrier contract to that effect. I returned the phone, and Amazon gave me a full refund.",OK
"This phone is basically the same asåÊSony Xperia Z5 Compact. Only upside: 1GB more ram. Downsides: not waterproof, slower processor, USB-C instead of standard Micro-USB, more expensive.At this price point Z5 Compact international model (that has fingerprint scanner) feels like a much better purchase.",OK
"because twice i got a phone with a burn thru on the screen ,from the same company& it still has some other problems.",OK
Fast Delivery. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the phone has period static during conversation.,OK
Al colocarle la SIM card (tarjeta) se conecta a Digitel de inmediato (a EDGE) desde Chacao- Caracas pero entiendo que la otra conexion ofrecida (y no disponible) es mas rapida...,OK
It doesnt get as hot as many people would like you to believe but warm enough to cause app crashes,OK
"The Figo Atrium surpassed my expectations. It is as good, and in some cases better than popular brands. It has an amazing camera, is fast and more user friendly than the phone it replaced.",OK
"Charging cover broke within 2 weeks and my Wifi signal drops constantly, but overall a decent phone.",OK
"the screen size is a little too small therefore, the included stylus can be quite useful for writing text messages. the screen is super fragile so be sure to place the screen cover on it right away. the speaker phone is quite loud but the reception is not too great.",OK
"I misut say i was very impressed with the phone. When i received it, the phone was in as good of a condition as it could of been considering its status. I did have difficulty with the slide out speaker but i assume that after excessive wear it jsut gets loose. Sometiems the power/unlock button is too pressed down that i can sometime not feel the click when it is pressed. Overall the phone works great. software is performing great, hardware is not in bad shape considering everything. Shipping could of been cleaner but thats okay. I love the phone.",OK
"This is not a review for the phone, which is kind of nice.But this version won't work on AT&T. The device has non-standard 17-digit IMEI number instead of standard 15-digit. As the result, I couldn't get it to register on AT&T's network. Called service support and took to the store, they just couldn't make it work.Have to return.",OK
I love these phones just hate that the prices change every week and wish I could get a wholesale price,OK
"Nice phone overall, worth the money you pay but be aware latest firmware may ruin your battery life so do your research before you update your firmware. Would give 5 stars when Asus fixes battery drain problem via firmware update. OTG does not work the way it suppose to....not enough power in USB port.",OK
This phone seems to have a glitch within the clock it's always showing me a wrong time. Then when I lock and unlock the phone the right time comes up. There is also a problem when it comes to locking the apps it works for 5minutes then stays unlocked. It's an OK phone but I won't buy it again,OK
"My charging port broke after a month or so because of a manufacturer's defect. This is a common issue with these phones. I got a battery charger and spare battery from Amazon for like $10. It's a pretty nice phone though. Sometimes it'll be weird with certain apps (snapchat, for example), but it does what I need it to do. This has been my main phone for months and I like it.",OK
"The BBerry Classic is a 5 star product. The reason for the 3 star is that the price from this Seller is less than Shop Blackerry, because this product is no longer under warranty. Delivery was on time. Product looked and felt new, except for outside box. It worked perfectly before I had to return it, because I couldn't update the software to the same higher version as my existing Classic ( which means compatibility issues). So much energy was wasted with calls to Blackerry Support, hence taking time to provide this write up. The good news is the prompt refund from Amazon.",OK
"I purchased this at a reasonable discount and thought I was getting a deal. The Razr's I own from prior purchases had metal exteriors. This one is plastic and I was a little disappointed. But it works and for the price, it is an acceptable solution for the situation.",OK
All other aspects of the phone are ok except that the trackball is not working and it is a T-Mobile branded against my expectation.,OK
Not that good--passable for a first phone for the kids. Mine was locked to At&t.,OK
Good product. But it started over heating. Good thing it still has the apple warranty. Will be sending to apple to get a refurbished phone.,OK
I love LGs. But this phone is glitchy and its annoying. The description says 4G but its actually 3G.,OK
"Phone was not as expected, firstly it came out without its accessories, so u had this purchase separately. The phone seemed more like a used phone than a new one even though it said new! It's like weight and a big t sleek yes, but now front camera flash. Nothing really to write home about I'm a bit disappointed, I should have gotten the bku selfie.",OK
"Phone was not unlocked as said in the description. Also it does not perform like a new phone should, the battery does not seem to last and it sometimes shuts completely off at 15%,20%,25%.",OK
I havent activated it yet i use it for stuff in app store like the survey apps i made the money i spent on it back in a week so not relay affected my slow preform and mines running 2.2.,OK
"The phone worked perfectly, but I had to replace the battery it came with. It wouldn't hold a charge until I got the new battery.",OK
"This phone no signal in my house , my husband 's phone have signal which is very simply phone.Both of us are AT&T",OK
"for the price is what you get, I would like to have the old school designs, with some modern functions, but now every cellphone seems to be very generic product on that segment, the screen is not so responsive, and it feels very very slow. for that segment of price I recommend a windows phone with abetter touchscreen.",OK
"was not as good as the org., no cover on the charging inlet, is not made out of good quality materials",OK
"the battery life is low, no good wi fi , would like to send it back and upgrade or get my money back. Thanks",OK
"It was a good phone with good voice quality, but it has a bad charging and battery life. It quit taking a charge and I only had it a little over one month. I decided after I contacted the seller (Just Cellular, who were very good about return policy) that I would get a refund for this phone. You can't get apps for this phone. The battery, you might get three or four days even if it is sitting idle. Overall I would it (0-10) a 5 for charging and an 8 for quality.",OK
"The product works amazing. But there are some troubles when you update some software. I had used the burst model for 4 years. The discover edition is amazing. But, the user must keep away from the updated.",OK
"It didnt take my sim card, so I gave it to my grandparents. They love and enjoy the optimus phone.",OK
"I got this phone for my daughter because she wanted a flip screen with a key board that would be easier to text on. I didn't want a data phone. I didn't want internet access for her. I thought that this would be what I wanted, but when we activated the phone with Verizon, they have a required data charge for this phone, and they won't let me block the internet like I did with the old phone. This sucks because it costs and extra $120 per year for nothing, and that makes me mad, because I'm getting screwed by the phone company, Verizon.",OK
"This was meant to be a temporary phone to get me to my next upgrade. So I didn't have high hopes to begin with. This phone uses a lot of battery an overheats easily. It was supposed to come with an extended battery, but it did not. I did notice that it occasionally drops some of my contacts and then the contact will reappear elsewhere and then I won't be able to find it again.... Very odd. Phone is heavier than my last phone (Samsung Infuse, which I adored) . All in all this isn't too bad of a phone. However, I don't believe I would buy another one and I may not recommend it whole heartedly to some folks.",OK
"I have owned an iPhone for the last 3 years and like many of the customers of this phone switched in an attempt to reduce my cellular expenses.My expectations were really high and so was the disappointment. I'm still giving this phone 3 stars because its probably a good smartphone if not compared to the iPhone. I can get used to the Android interface and structure - that's not the issue. My quarrel with this phone is perhaps not even with the hardware, rather with it's Android OS deployment. The issue is that of stability. In less than one week of ownership I have had to reboot it numerous times, had multiple occasions of an applications responding VERY slowly and have seen some odd behavior such as text messages forwarded to multiple email boxes without solicitation.I'm hoping that all these issues will get resolved via firmware/OS updates. As much as I wanted this phone to be an equal replacement to my iPhone, unfortunately it is not.",OK
"Low signal with this phone, although for the price, I'm happy to say I bought as a back up phone!",OK
"The phone was in better than expected shape for a refurb. The accessories were not Samsung. Just some off-beaten, dollar store brand. I ended up returning it because of software and hardware issues that could not be fixed here and was covered under the warranty.",OK
The buttons are so small on this phone it's no joke. It's a lot smaller than the picture shows. I'm buying the phone for a family member so have not used it to review the working.,OK
"I hate sellers who trick people to buy their products. Can you set the title correctly? The phone is unlocked but is fabricated with AT&T. I just got this phone, and I have to change it because I didn't know it because you don't have this information visible. Other things, the phone's box was smashed and very scratched. After a long week waiting for this perfect phone, I received it in that bad condition and AT&T at all parts of the phones. YOU CAN'T UPDATE THE SOFTWARE, IT HAS 4.4.2 KITKAT. THEREFORE, YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD APPS AND GAMES SUCH AS MADDEN NFL.",OK
"The only problem I had with my phone was a major part of my phone. I have had my phone for 90 days and it won't charge at all anymore. Phone is dead, the charger just drops out the phone.",OK
"I never thought I'd miss emojis so much til I got this phone. It has very few old school emojis. There are apps to add them to the phone, but they mostly don't work or slow the phone down lots. The phone already isn't that fast. (3g)",OK
This cell phone provides the just the service I require in my life. I want just phone service and some text.,OK
"This was a decent phone while I had it. The phone is a comfortable size and weight, and the keyboard was pleasant to use. However it did have some glitches in the software which would cause it to freeze on occasion or would make the phone restart.",OK
"I bought the phone for it's compact size and nice camera. After playing with Android and disabling background servicing on most of my apps I did get the batter to last two days. The photos look great.However, the speaker you hold up to your ear to make a phone call failed after four months. I have not gotten it repaired even though it is under warranty because I read all the horror stories of people getting the phone back in pieces. Also, they do not make it easy to figure out how to return it.It seems like the second speaker might be starting to fail too, so at that point I will have to get it repaired.",OK
"is ok, but sometimes is hard because the touch is so sensitive.also the pictures are really bad quality.",OK
"was looking for a phone to pair up with Chrysler Uconnect radio. This was on there list of compatable phones, this phone kept dropping out had to pair up and still could not get text messages as it should have.",OK
"I recieved the N910T model, which is not what I ordered. However, it's what I wanted anyway, and I ordered knowing that other reviewers had reported getting the N910T model, and being that this listing was cheaper than other available listings, I went for it. The headphone jack does not work, but the phone itself is in great shape.",OK
Serves a purpose. Can't wait to go back to my smartphone that doesn't randomly shut off on me.,OK
The phone is good but it didn't come with good instructions for use. Have to really search online to find them and I don't have the time. Supposed to have a flashlight but we still haven't been able to figure out how to work it.,OK
"I got two of these phones to use overseas and it is definitely an international version and it was unlocked. The only thing is that one had ""Claro"" (which apparently is a telecommunications company) logo printed on the bottom quite large and noticeable. It doesn't really bother me, I am over it, but I am sure others would not care for it. I also find that the ""Y"" button tends to stick at times. Also the camera does not have a flash, so I was unhappy about that, it really doesn't take very good pictures. But it works in Indonesia where I am, so it suits the purpose. Also, the model is a few years old, so the accessories for it are limited and harder to find. Overall, an average phone.",OK
"The one I bought. 18 days past the return date it just stop working, started getting hot on my wrist so I took it off The screen was getting hotter by the minute. Then just black no lights or nothing.Couldn't tell if it was off or on so I took the batter out to cool it down. Then went to Amazon and found out it was to late. Aint that a bitch!!! It was ok for the period that it worked, but 30 days just don't cut it. Even at that price.",OK
I had to get a new battery for it he one that was with the phone didnt work. They sent me a new battery for free and it still wont stay charged.,OK
"I bought this for an older relative who specifically wanted a phone with a keyboard for texting, but did not want a smart phone. It does meet those specifications.",OK
"Nice phone, but volume is really low and the screen came with a crack to the lower left side :l",OK
"The bandwith doesn't go over 1900, so I can't use it for digitel in VenezuelaIn modus H+.",OK
"I absolutely love Posh smartphones but the experience does not translate to the tablet. It is fine looking and well built unit but the screen image makes it close to useless. The camera is so bad I have to assume there is something wrong with it because it is about equal to an old flip phone camera. The processor also seems slow and the experience is choppy,It's cheap but it works and seems sturdy. I think this is a perfect device for young children to play with and destroy. If you are on a very tight budget I would say it is a fair value at under $100 and will do basic task fairly welk.",OK
Received with no instructions. Had to go to a verizon store to have someone help with the layout of the phone.,OK
"es un telefono basico con pantalla tactil, tiene lo necesario para las redes sociales como facebook, el video y las fotos de calidad aceptablescomo todos los nokia tiene un excelente sonido, tiene wifi, trae incluida una tarjeta de memoria de 2 gigas para almacenar canciones foto y video.el telefono viene en espaÌ±ol y otros 10 idiomas para escojer, y se puede actualizar todo el software desde ovi.asi que lo de version usa es solo por la garantia porque si algo pasa hay que devolverlo a eeuu.",OK
"It was a great phone until I pulled it out my pocket and the screen was broke. I didn't sit on it, or dropped it just placed it there to grab a pen and pulled it back out and my screen was shattered. These are cheap phones so you get what you buy I guess :(",OK
"Description stated - 'brand New in original retail box, Phone has Original plastic screen with all accessories have original packaging'. The phone I received was not in retail package. It was a generic htc package and the phone did not even have the plastic wrap. There was a sticker in the back of the phone. NB 08/13. Research on the internet comes up as New Breed Refurbished Phone inspected on 08/13. There is no warranty information nor user manual. I opted to buy this phone as the order was fulfilled by Amazon. The phone did not have any visible damage and so far in the past 4 days I did not have issues and the windows update went well. This is why I'm keeping this phone. There is always a disappointment when you receive the product not per the description. So buyers keep this in mind while ordering. You can easily find factory refurb models else where for around 175 or less",OK
"The only major problem I've had with this phone is that it freezes and sometimes it can be a pain to restart it. Then it takes a while for it to load all your data once you turn it back on. Besides that it's good. Not the best phone ever. If you text and surf the web a lot like I do and don't have a big budget for a smart phone, it's a good phone.",OK
"Yes it was a very good phone and it works better then expected, considering they do not make a phone like this. For the wife and I do not text nor go on line using our phones.Thanks",OK
Odd feel. The basic reason for a phone is to talk right? This is the worst flaw in the phone. I had a hard time answering and placing phone calls. The phone seems to have a long pause at the oddest times. I am glad after one month this phone was ruined by water. I would hate to put up with this phone for 2 years.,OK
"The touchpad is a bit annoying. As I place the phone to my face while speaking, it drops my calls since my cheeks press against the hang up button. So now I have to use the speaker while talking but sometimes you want to keep the conversation private. Besides that, I like little things like the strength of the speakers and the size of the phone memory.",OK
"If you are looking to purchase an unlocked phone do not buy!! The phone it self is great but if you are looking to activate with any company other than at&t buying this phone serves no purpose. It cost me 100 bucks to activate the phone with another service (t-mobile) only to find out that this phone was not unlocked. I have been a week without a phone and it is really nerve racking.It will be at least another 50 bucks to get it unlocked in which I will be waiting 3-5 buisness days to get my phone back. Me personally, cannot wait that long. I will be asking for a refund!!",OK
"This phone reminds me of how PCs used to run when I was a kid - but back then I had the patience for it. The phone itself has a fairly smooth operation, not considering the processing speed. Sometimes it will just vibrate continuously for no reason and the only way to stop it is to turn it off! I bought it because it was not very costly and I could replace my other POS!Don't buy it if you want to run a lot of apps. It is a good phone for a person that just sends text messages and makes calls.",OK
"Although the unit was unlocked as noted in the description, I was unable to perform software updates. I kept receiving an error message that the phone was suspected as being rooted, meaning the operating system had been modified and therefore could not be updates with a later android version. I returned the phone within the time limit for a full refund.",OK
"creo que el producto segun los comentarios que lei antes de comprar decia que funcionaba bien para las bandas 3G de movistar y movilnet venezuela y por eso lo compre, pero el que me llego a mi trae las bandas 1, 4 , 8 que aqui en venezuela funciona para digitel",OK
"This phone is fine, but I have issues. It came with poor battery life. It doesn't hold even one full days' charge. Also, it does not synchronize with MS Outlook. I bought this because I was tired of people making fun of my old 2006 Blackberry, but my Blackberry battery lasted for two days, and when I plugged it in to the computer, without doing anything, it would synchronize with Outlook. Any new calendar items I added to my phone would be on my computer, and vice versa. Same with contacts. I am now back to double-entering everything like I did 10 years ago. Welcome forward to the Dark Ages! I am told that there is a 3rd party software that will do the Syncing, but it has had mixed reviews, and it will cost me $40 to find out if it's worth a hoot or not. The phone has some nice features, but it has defined itself to me by what it does NOT have.",OK
"Disappointing.If it was going to be this thick and heavy, it could have had a replaceable battery.There is nothing about it I can rate great or unique...actually sorry I bought it, butthat's my mistake and I pay the price.",OK
"When I received the iphone there was a crack on the back of the phone across the camera eye. It was mentioned in the description before I purchased the phone, it had no scratches or cracks. That statement is misleading. I would not use the vendor again. Thank you, pw",OK
Great case but dirt easily gets stuck under the screen if you take it off and it's pretty bulky,OK
"I ordered the Blackberry Bold 9000 without camera, it came with a camera. I received the wrong charger and cord and had to purchase another. There is no 1-800 number to relay this information",OK
"Absolute bottom-of-the-barrel budget phone. These days, I only use it so as a microSD card reader. I feel like this would be a good hand-me-down phone for a young kid -- it works fine, and it is ZERO frills.",OK
"This phone is a good phone for keeping up with emails, and making calls, and texting. After about a month of owning this phone, it would freeze up and take about three minutes to open a text, and if you were unlucky (like I was a lot) you would have to wait another few minutes before it let you input text in the message. This phone also has an awful GPS navigation system in it.. It is a great back-up phone, but you are better off with a newer smart phone that is on the market.",OK
"The phone work ok, we are unable to remove/uninstall most of the AT&T information that is on the phone I use T-Mobile. Also, no pen or charger included.",OK
All in all a great phone. Except for the fact that after only 3 months the charging port went out.,OK
A nice inexpensive phone (in its day) bought used BUT it will not run any of the new apps as its OS cannot be upgraded. It works well as a basic backup phone and as a music player. that's about it.,OK
wasnt what I expected Im unable to download any music but other than that everything else works just fine thanks,OK
The seller did everything as promised. Shipping was early and no hassle. The phone worked but not that great. Seemed it was one that slipped between the cracks. But I will give the seller 5 stars.The phone about 1 star.Customer service was awesome.,OK
"Got this phone over 2 weeks. I start having reception problems, disconneted in the middle of conversation (eventhough I was staying at the same spot), couldn't hear momentarily, no ring. This phone is a lot worse than Blackjack II.",OK
I bought this phone 3 weeks ago to replace a phone on my family plan. I activated it like instructions said with no problems. I originally was concerned from reading a previous review saying verizon will say its a prepaid but i took the chance and its worked out fine. My only small issue is i thought it would be new but it had to be a used phone because had little indentation and smudges and no manual but i'd purchase it again for the price.,OK
"I was not looking to spend lot on a cell phone as there is always a better one available in every month. Everything, be it Processor or RAM ..are increasing and so are the Applications size. So I narrowed down to the basic features of a smart phone: Calling, browsing, music, GPS, photos/videos, VOIP etc. BLUE Life pure was a good deal.Pros: Perfect shape and design, Decent voice quality, elegant looks, holds light.Cons: Screen could have been better. I doubt there isn't Stereo speaker as well. Camera is poor in low light.",OK
"Yeah, I still own an older iphone 4s, but it's a great deal for a quality product. Unfortunately, the camera cannot be silenced because this is an import model from Japan, but that info was not shared in the description. Also, the volume down button will not function; I have to use the CC menu.",OK
"I didn't have the product but it was sent to the Philippines, given as a gift but I understand its working very good,n happy.",OK
"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone.",OK
to flip open to qwerty it is not easy last phone i used my right thumb to open now i have to spin phone around to find where it opens i bought a refurbed phone and after 3 weeks battery needs constant recharging,OK
The phone is great. The battery life suck! When i'm playing games or watching video it dies in 3 hrs.,OK
Not what my son was expecting. It had a slow response time when accessing apps.,OK
Not as user friendly and easy to personalize as other smartphones like galaxy s4 or lg g3.,OK
Came quick . I did need to purchase a new battery because the one in the phone was drained .,OK
"cada vez que grabo un telÌ©fono, se tiene que empezar agregando una palabra nueva. DeberÌ_a tener el diccionario espaÌ±ol desde el inicio",OK
"My service with this phone is TERRIBLE! It drops calls constantly, sucks at sending pictures, sends/receives duplicate texts, doesn't have sound when it's supposed to ring, etc. The phone has nothing wrong with it cosmetically, it's just terrible on it's own. Thankfully I'll only need this phone for another month.",OK
"Do not buy this phone from the seller Joycells. I order three phone and according to the description the phone is white but they send me all black color phone. Also the accessories on the picture is missing as in picture showing (e.g headphone, battery, back cover) . The battery on the phone is not original from Samsung.",OK
Got it sooner than what it said in order. That was GREAT!!!! But downside was it came with no book and everything was in chinese.,OK
"It's ambidextrous gimmick sometimes screws up your phone call. People say I sound distant, which could mean that the mic and speaker don't switch as fast as the rest of the phone.The phone also shuts down at random or when charging in a car or mobile battery.Still pretty solid for the price though.",OK
I bought this phone in the summer and it keeps shutting down every time. Yesterday it shut down with out any sign of coming back on. I've had it charging for a few hours this morning and still nothing,OK
"needed to take it to a celular lab, spent some more money on it in order to reboot it's opearting system. still haven't actually use it since it's still in the lab.",OK
it's not water proof i search for iphone 5s water proof case but it does work not worth the amount of money i paid for it,OK
i had an issue with it overheating.most likely just a defective phone. just returned instead of exchanged. process was super easy.,OK
I bought this phone because of the price and I'm trying to just get out of my contract with tmobile. It doesn't do much but that's ok. I can talk on it and the alarm works that's my main concern. Texting is awful and it turns off for no reason. My reason for buying the phone are met but if you want to play games or text get something else.,OK
"The phone is pretty easy to use but at the end of the day it is a simple phone. I find the key pad hard to use. Also, you can not delete a bunch of texts at once. Have to do each one separately.Also I did not have an easy time with easy email set up.This phone is an upgrade from the very simple cell phone but not a match for the more expensive smart phone. It's about your budget.",OK
"I loved my Breeze 2, but the battery died. So I bought an unlocked Breeze 3. and was able to move my SIM card and connect easily to the same AT&T network (with the loss of at least one contact: beware!). Breeze 3 is a convenient, easy--to-understand little phone (I'm 67) . But the sound quality is full of echoing and dead seconds; the battery barely lasts 24 hours with moderate use. But I'll get used to both those difficulties, rather than face the ridiculousness of a ""smart"" phone. Takes good pictures, but not much memory to store them.",OK
"Recieved the product ok, but as I bought batteries for the phone, it never turned on, tried to charge it but nothing happened. This product deserves a 3 out of 5 because it arrived on-time, but sadly didn't turn on",OK
I think this phone just didn't like me. I got it used and see why they gave it up.,OK
"LTE would not work in USA on S5 mini. You'll see an H on your phone instead of 3G or 4G. And the LTE will not work no matter what. Believe me. I purchased one and there's no way you can make this phone to be LTE. Other than that, the phone works great.",OK
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,OK
"Phone worked great on Wi-Fi, but wouldn't accept my Consumer Cellular Sim card. Very Disappointed, So I returned it for full refund.",OK
For the price it seems to be working quite well. Had some trouble finding SIM cards for Trac done so went with at&t,OK
"I ultimately returned this, it didn't work correctly on my service provider and the camera was terrible.Performance was laggy and it was a fingerprint magnet. I'd skip this. - Try the Blu Studio Energy 2",OK
"It told me I was buying a 16GB phone and it only has 11GB, need to look closer to the product, but all in al it is amazing. Not a single issue.",OK
"Old system , can't install some apps, upgrade to ice cream no longer supported by Samsung. If just need basic phone, ok.!",OK
"A slight problem with charger, when my phone connected with charger a little bit shocking I got, please solve my problem",OK
"To it's credit, LG makes a reliable product which had good organizational screens. It's just a lower end model. As a result, I moved onto HTC for good unlocked service at a slightly higher price.",OK
"Works well, can't find a replacement battery, this one doesn't last a busy day. Manual not too informative. better than what I had.",OK
"I love the software platform, clarity of screen and ease of use. Unfortunately, I received a lemon, but the seller is handling it with no complaints.",OK
Nice for what it is and can do but as for features and stuff like that could be better but all in all when u need a gsm phone and you tired of payin the price for an actual phone then a phone watch is most of the time cheap dont kill ya pockets and the way to go if u dont care bout social media and other bs like that so,OK
Phone was easy to activate but the charger that was sent with it doesn't work.,OK
"all is ok with the device but i really hates the headphone that comes with it, after see some reviews on internet there are not the headphone that usually come in the box",OK
"was way older phone doesnt go online or take pictures ,but is perfect for and edlerly person it has large numbers and is very simple",OK
This very bulky and you have to press significantly harder on the screen for the buttons to work. After taking it off I noticed that my device was quite warm. I wish I would have explored other options.,OK
"Came on time gsm unlocked was able to use it right away not a bad phone. Just the 8.1 windows software, app store, and don't drop this phone the outer plastic breaks easy but the screen is great.",OK
I like the phone. Especially for the price. However it did not support 64GB Micro SD as it was advertised... It did not recognized the SD card. I had to use my old 16GB Micro SD card to make it work.,OK
"I had an iPhone 4, that I only replaced because I switched from AT&T to Verizon. This phone was great when it arrived, but about 6 months later, I now don't have reliable sound unless I have headphones plugged in or it is on a dock. My alarms still go off, and sometimes it rings, so it's not the speakers or anything, just a software issue I guess. I new I was taking a risk when buying a used phone from Amazon, so I can't be horribly upset, but I'm now thinking hard about whether I'll ever do that again.",OK
Worked for about a week and then the tower signal started fading and disconnecting completely. 2g networks are supposed to become retired and its causing network problems. I was never able to run data trough phone. The positive is a trial on smart watch usage.,OK
this phone have great features and lovely camera. but I have had this phone for a few months now and placed it to charge and now is refusing to come back on. This happened with a previous one I had and just thought that one was defective. I just rang the phone and although the phone calling it is saying it is on the phone itself isn't responding.Waiting for the battery to die again to see if it really has an issue :(,OK
This phone has no slide out keyboard. The wrong pic is being displayed with this phone. Other than than its not a bad phone has a lot of features for such a compact phone.,OK
I got the wring charger and the keyboard keeps doing double and triple letters. Also the screen is hard to swipe and push buttons.,OK
"For the most part this is a good phone but I do have a few issues with it. The battery has a tendency to wiggle and shut the phone off or restart it. I fixed the issue by shoving some paper in the battery space. The screen cracked when I dropped it... my fault but it is an overpriced part ($45) and very difficult to replace compared to most touch screen. I feel overall the phone is comparable to an early model galaxy, not really competitive with new generation flagship smart phones, partly because of the marshmallow o.s.",OK
phone was ok but the slide was not the best but ok for used phone. Daughter liked it ok till the plug in messed up.,OK
"Phone freezes up, very erratic, i.e. sometimes phone will not respond to you, by that I mean when texting or writing an email, you will have to push over and over the letter you are trying to type. I find myself erasing characters very often. Also when trying to scroll phone will not respond or it will respond to your first touch of the screen when in fact you are wanting to scroll up or down. I was told this phone was not a refurbished phone but I'm inclined to believe otherwise.",OK
I ordered two of these lg env3 (vx9200) cause I loved this phone and I wanted to change my plan to basic phones. They are great but one came with the wrong software and the other doesnt have the proper updated software it needs so I cant put music on it. So that is a big disappointment. Especially when you don't have transportation to a Verizon store to get it updated probably....,OK
"My husband likes this phone. Replaced lost one. Tried to unlock it, got code from ATT with no problem, but unlock screen where you enter code only popped up once. We could not get it to open again. Gave up trying.",OK
"Needed a phone without Internet access. Just a phone, period. This was the only one I could find. Saw a video where it was demonstrated how durable this phone is. It really has a nice feel-- won't slip from your hand or pocket. Good sound, long battery life. Bought it used so it didn't have a charger, and it was difficult to locate one. Tons of replacement batteries available though. Takes getting used to reading the screen, but it's a simple phone that works.",OK
"Terrible battery, horrible internal storage. Almost all my apps are on my microsd, but I have uninstall apps and then reinstall them to update them because the phone is perpetually full.",OK
"This phone has some very nice features, the down side is concerning the volume. You will have to use an earpiece, even the external speaker is hard to hear during moments with low to moderate background noise. Most times the earpiece will not stay paired and then you just have to shut off the blue tooth then turn it back on, but sometimes it won't allow you to shut the blue tooth off and back on Then you have to reboot the phone. The battery is not removable and you cannot add memory. The battery life should have been better, even after making sure nothing else is running, the battery seems to drain fast. The wireless display is awesome and works very well, I can stream movies and video to my television. you can set the alarm and shut the phone off and it will automatically start itself to activate the alarm. I'm not totally happy with it, but I am somewhat satisfied. As long as you're informed on what you're getting, the choice of buying makes the decision easier.",OK
Some of the buttons are not responsive and stick but phone makes calls and sends text no problem,OK
"I had written a review and I guess it wasn't submitted. Here's my review after having it for a week.Pros: Huge screen, great Android upgrade, two SIM slots. Decent front facing camera. Is fast when it comes to doing simple tasks.Cons: Poor to fair screen resolution, lots of pixels. Audio both speaker and with head phones is poor (with head phones you have to put it on the highest volume, and even then you could barely hear).Came quickly (about two business days), decent price, average budget Samsung phone. Wish it had better display and audio and then it would be 4 stars.Also I chose Gold and had to get use to it, but now I adore the color since it's sorta metallic yet subtle.Update: After three months of having this device I have noticed the following: Poor audio still, bad cell reception, developed a white dead pixel, is a standard samsung phone but doesn't have the highest resolution. Its worth the money due to it being unlocked.",OK
"It is as durable as advertised and has an incredible battery life. Yet, the phone feels cheap and plasticky. It even has poor call quality, which is almost literally its only job. I would not buy it again unless it was sold at a much lower price point.",OK
"The phone i like. I don't know if it was new like the ad said. Because it turns off own it's own, it freezes up, it was not unlocked like the ad said.all so I was told it couldn't be unlocked so i found a sight that for about 34.00 dollars got me the unlocking code. I guess I'm more diapointed with the seller than the phone.",OK
"This phone was adverised as new. It definitely was used prior to our obtaining it. the adress book was cleaned out, but the voicemail would go to a previously installed number. Anyone looking to obtain a new phone, I would look elseware.",OK
"Works great in Germany, Czech and France, but eats data, normal usage (for me) of roaming on my Iphone 6, I used 3 gb in 5 days with no video streaming just emails (a few) face book whats app and line, i did not consider this hi usage.Pros: Works GreatCons: More expensive then pre buying data from you carreir",OK
"this phone was ok, it was great while it lasted, had to replace with the Aquios Crystal.... so long mini ;) it was fun while it lasted",OK
"THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE. THE OTHER I KEEP FOR MY SPARE BACK UP, BUT I NEVER HAVE HAD TO USE IT . THE RECONITIONED ONE IS OK ,BUT THE EAR BUD PLUG DOESNT WORK.",OK
Phone worked perfectly but I think my battery is defected. My phone gets hot within 10 minutes in use and battery gets drained,OK
It's only when I received the phone I saw is a dual Sim phone. I didn't know that. When I read the details about the cellular they didn't talk about this.,OK
I Purchased This Phone for my teen daughter and she loves it .It's a Pretty Good Phone For The Price Sometimes She Cant Get A Good Signal To make Phone Calls And She Has Problems With The Calls Being Dropped But Other Than That She Loves Her Phone The Phone Has A Nice Sized Screen and The Camera Is Great On It The Front Flash For The Front Camera Is Great Also .I Would Recommend This For Parents Buying For They're Kids It A Great Start Off Phone,OK
"I received the i9506 instead of the i9505. Moreover, this version does not include Spanish, so i had to flash it with another rom.Regardin the device, it works fine, but is not compatible with my LTE network. Uruguayan users: please be careful with this model.",OK
"Way better if you have a Samsung, iPhone doesn't work to great all you can do is call on it. Also my camera was crooked.",OK
"The international version of the phone, I changed two phone cards, because the network can not",OK
"The phone would be better if the apps for it weren't horrible. Hardly has the apps that google play has. You can't download apps from other stores and the apps that are available, such as Facebook or map my run, do not work right.",OK
"Sold and shipped by Amazon. There is something wrong with the DAC chip, audio is full of noise. The slide is a little bit loose at the bottom left corner. Small scratch at the top. Other parts are perfect. Amazon sent me three products with many issues, horrible quality. Decide to keep it as warranty remains.",OK
A phone this inexpensive doesn't need all the stuff that's on it. It makes the user interface too complicated. Better to keep it simple. Signal / sound quality was OK but it was just a temporary phone while my real one was being serviced. I'll keep it in the drawer as an emergency backup since I've spent more on bad lunches than this thing cost. Did the job I needed it to do.,OK
"I just received my phone and I ordered an UNLOCK PHONE as it stated but received ""locked Phone , I believe if u specifically stated that the phone ""UNLOCK"" it should be .. now I have to pay extra money to unlock it...",OK
I have just purchased 2 of these phones and this is my second day of use. The phones seem comparable with top of the line phones if you don't want to spend that type of money. You are in control of the apps on your phone and it was easy to transfer my applications from my Samsung S4. However I have not given it 4 or more stars as I have found that I have to press a little too hard on the screen. I will give it at least 6 weeks before commenting again on its performance.,OK
I've been having problems with the phone since I bought it. I have a problem with my battery port and it will cost 60 to fix.,OK
"The phone is ok, but the worse part the letters are a little off and it makes typing difficult to to mention you need to press really hard on every letter to type. Not liking this part at all.",OK
I specifically asked if this was the H815 or the H815T as I wanted the H815 only but I got the H815T and didn't see that until after I started using it.,OK
Has some glitches....but hey what can I say....you get what you pay for. Maybe its just this style with the keyboard,OK
"Hello Mr or Mrs I want to let you know that I receive the item yesterday ,but this item on amazon spot said that include beats Audio( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078LXM40/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0) and I can't see it.",OK
"I had the galaxy s4 for over two years and loved it. I cracked the screen so I upgraded to the galaxy s5. I am not happy with the s5, it is difficult to charge, it's very sensitive and will not work with just any charger. Will not work with my portable battery chargers.",OK
"At the beginning I was very disappointed since I bought this as a gift to my son and after a little bit more than a week the screen went black and after that it was dead.Thanks to Amazon support I was able to get guidance to solve the problem. I did as the manufacturer recommended and it starts working again.It has frozen a couple of times since then, but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt since the phone system is running some updates I hope can solve the problem.I have used other phones like Blackberry, I Phone and Samsung and never had this kind of problems.",OK
Works just as good as the 100 dollar watches but with few features and a less camera quality.,OK
Really like the phone except its Wi-Fi MAC address changing. Have to return it this time. Might try to buy another one to see whether i got some luck.,OK
"The phone is as it stated, I have dropped it several times and its still good. Unfortunately the plug in to the wall charger is not working any more. it just stopped, but the plug in to the car still works so i can still charge the phone.",OK
it works for now but BB RIM need to offer better direct apps. thank you.,OK
"Delivery of phone was faster than expected. The description of the phone was like new and therefore paid $30 more than other ""refurbished"" phones available. Unfortunately the phones speaker does not work well. Persons receiving calls find it very difficult to hear. This is a problem with these phones and one that should have been checked before releasing it for resale. My son is reluctant to send it back despite my recommendation. The concern is it will get worse. Can you hear me now? Nope.",OK
"Response time is slow. Overall phone is ok, but haing had the 7 and down grading i notice all the little inconsistencies and notable changes",OK
"Bought the first one for my son about a year ago. Works fine, especially for the price which was about $57 and free shipping. Bought another for my daughter last month, but this one had a defective touch screen that would not power on. Amazon's no-hassle return policy is truly terrific and between them and/or the vendor, a UPS driver was soon at my door with a completed return label, all postage paid. Soon after, the purchase amount was fully refunded to my credit card. As long as such great customer-first policies are in place, I'd have no qualms about trying this phone yet again. After all, the first one is a real trooper, now in its second year of service for my son.",OK
"The delivery was prompt, but the back case of the phone was from a different phone entirely and didn't fit. Luckily, I still had my old phone that I had let my grandkids play with, and was able to use the back case of it. Also, the battery that came with the phone must have been used, because it won't hold a charge for more than a half a day. I have to carry a charger around with me at all times.",OK
"nice phone love it. problem is itss not whats described , it only has the phone and a charger , no mem card or other stuff,false advertising",OK
It looks cute but performance is so so due to os matter. Also we should be careful when we select the version. 100-1 2 3 4 5...,OK
i have only used it for just a few minutes so i can't say much about it. seems to work good. has all the features that i need. loudspeaker not much to rave about.,OK
"The phone came on time , but had reception as well as calling issues, despite two other phones working perfectly of different brand at the same location. Amazon was prompt enough to provide me refund.",OK
"good cellphone for the basic activities, like bbm. twitter or facebook, but don't expect it will be smooth all the time...",OK
Phone works good but the power cord was broke when I received it. I had to go out and buy one.,OK
"This one is my wife's. For overall use, loves it. But she really wanted an improved camera and video over our previous Lumia phones.Yes, camera has better resolution. BUT....audio recording gets blasted out in loud environments, which the Nokia did not. So...meets the needs for talk/text/apps...does not for her quality pictures and video under certain conditions. Probably better than average for it's price point.",OK
"Its ok, it scratches easly and it seems a bit cheap , i never really put my cards in it didnt really feel safe",OK
"Wasn't the phone I thought was, and also didn't know out had been used and not brand new..I was looking for a prepaid phone for my daughter and was very upset when I tried to set it up that it was a contact phone. When I called too find out about returning out the man Sayyid I had to pay a restock fee..so I'm out shipping and restock fee...wasn't happy at all!",OK
it came in the mail very quickly but its a mediocre phone i know it was going to be but its all i can afford,OK
Phone is alright. Biggest problem with BLU is they don't release new software load. I want KitKat and I doubt I'll ever get it unless I hack and install custom ROM.,OK
"It was an okay item for the money , i don't own it anymore , I believe I bought this item for my Brother a while back .",OK
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",OK
I really like the phone but beware of life buying a refurbished if you're planning on switching your number over to Google Project Fi. My # was in Verizon and the 5x had previously ported a T-MOBILE number. More than 7 days of trying to port my Verizon # and I just gave up and got a new #. Since then the service has been great and my 14yo daughter LOVES it. The phone itself if lightweight and heavy on features. We bought the tempered glass protector and a case as well. We'll worth the $$.,OK
"its a good phone. Depends on what you want but for its price, you wouldn't get anything better. i like .",OK
"Very nice phone. The only thing I didn't lily was that you can't get a lot of games such as Minecraft or Candy Crush Saga, but that is not the sellers fault. You also don't get earbuds with the phone. You get a headset adapter. Works great and came brand new.",OK
"Good starter smart phone.Out in the field kind of phone. No worries if you accidentally drop it, considering the price.",OK
its nice battery problem only 50 weeks then only one day to chargebut good for me..i like it gooood,OK
"Abyssmal battery life. It's an okay phone but I have to charge it twice a day. Waiting on new Nexus phones to come out later this year, and I'll probably be giving this thing away.",OK
the phone was ok but it started have trouble with it and it stop chager i should have sent the phone back,OK
"Phone was ok, but it came in an S3 box, battery didn't work and didn't come with headphones. Overall phone works OK.",OK
"The charger doesn't charge as fast as an ""actual"" iPhone charger and the phone did NOT come with headphones.",OK
Delivery was on time. In general liked the phone but for some reason we nor technical support personnel were unable to get phone to work on Straight Talk 4G.,OK
It DOES NOT fully support ATT 4G LTE in the US. Other than that it is a great phone. Camera is unbelievable.,OK
Lasted about 7 months before the battery port started to fail. Don't bother. Need to get a new phone again.,OK
"If you are looking to buy this phone at this point, I would say pass. There is no support or pushed updates at this point, and the last update made a few features not the best. I loved this phone at the time for the full keyboard feature.If you are a die hard droid 2 user and want a cheap phone... sure go ahead and grab it. the last update did not ""break"" anything but if you have used the phone a lot you may notice a quirk here and there.",OK
Really enjoying this item but my front facing camera is not working out. I don't know if I want to return this item or not. My front facing camera is extremely zoomed in and I can't find a way of zooming it out. Tried several things and it just doesn't work. Any help? If not returning.,OK
"not really brings 8GB of internal memory, and can not connect to data network h + , I am somewhat disappointed , plus much hindrance to use the camera, but for the price you can not expect much-",OK
"The Blu Win JR phone works great with the dual SIM card. This saves me from having to carry 2 phones around. I only have a few minor issues. First, they keyboard seems ""smaller"" than other devices. I find myself having to fix mis-spelled words more often. The only other issue was the screen protectors. It did not come already on the phone like one I purchased earlier for my wife. I have put screen protectors on several phones but on the Blu, the things just would not completely stick.",OK
Bad volume takes 9 hrs to fully charge speaker phone low big phone but slow and for straight talk carriers u have to buy $60 SIM kit to switch over,OK
"The phone looks great, all functions seem to be OK. However, the camera only looks good without zoom in. Compared with Nexus 5, which zooms up to 4 times and still sharp, this Z1 camera's zoom in function is simply cheating. It magnifies the image 4 times without re-focusing. Any image under zoom in is blurry. The price is too high for such a built-in camera.Other comments: the battery lasts 2 days, which is good. But it increased the size dramatically, so compared with Nexus 5, this phone it too big in hand. The external charging function is a good feature.If you want a good phone and never owned Nexus 5, you should change your focus from this point.",OK
"I like the phone but I got confused because I was thinking was the regular LG G3 and other wise I can't activated whit spring o boost mobil that company is that I want it, until moment I have the phone in it box ;(",OK
"i like the phone.. my phone arrive after 3 days which i thought it will take 5-10 days... really smooth transaction. but the thing is the original headset and charger is already change.. the headset is not the flatcord, this type is like a headset of older htc phones.. and the charger is just generic.... i will give 5 stars if the original headset and charger is included...",OK
Was intending to replace my unlocked iPhone with a mytouch 4g. I was not impressed. Android doesn't hold a candle to iOS. (my opinion),OK
Its a nice phone. Its an unlocked phone. But it does not work well on T-Mobile. Connection drops frequently. I configured the APN as required but never got above 3g though I have a 4g connection. It also doesn't let me use wi-fi hotspot. I think it tries to check with Verizon server when I try to activate it instead of T-Mobile. Have to return it ultimately.,OK
"Purchased two of these phones. Both worked fine until one of them stopped charging recently. Good midrange phone, unfortunately one was a dud",OK
"Okay, the phone came exactly on the estimated day and I was so excited to get home and break it open. At first glance I was very pleased, the phone feels lovely and the screen looks great, very clear and vibrant. The camera is honestly only good when it has good lighting. I can go a full day without charging the battery with regular usage. Everything ran smoothly and I was very happy with the money I spent until I received a call.I answered the phone and heard nothing. I hung up and called back and still heard nothing. Apparently, the earpiece doesn't work. I was only calls to talk when I put the phone on speaker. After updating and restarting the phone twice, the earpiece still didn't work. I was so disappointed because I everything else about the phone worked so perfectly and to my expectations. And then I find that one of the most crucial features of the phone doesn't work!I haven't seen this problem with anybody else yet, but this has been my experience since I received the phone two days ago.",OK
I bought this phone for my mother and it works great for her use but for some reason it keeps shutting off at times and sometimes between calls and that is what is getting on my nerve.,OK
"It's good but the only problem is that the phone is the chinese version, so if you are in the USA or any other country that It's not China do not buy it because Samsung won't fix it if it suffer any damage. So in consequence it would be better if you get your phone at Best Buy or any other store no matter its price because at least you'll know at least the version of the phone and where it comes frome.",OK
"Todo bien, sin problemas. Solo que el cargador no era compatible con las conexiones en Venezuela. Tuve que comprar un cargador. De resto todo bien.",OK
"A great Cellphone and unlocked, But Still a RM-820 AT&T and some functionalities, like 4G, doesn't work in roaming. Is a great cellphone, Windows Phone Work perfectly, only this and sometimes the call someone my voice sound with a echoes. But is a great device",OK
If your looking for a cheap waterproof phone! This is it It can handle wear and tear to a certain extent I have had 3 of these phones and been through the sea and ocean and heavy duty rock work.... I lost a phone due to screen cracks and my other phone is cracked now!,OK
"So, after having the Ascend mate 2 for about a month, I figured I should update my review. I'm sure this was a nice phone when it first came out, however, Huawei needs to come out with a new phone for the U.S. the phone comes with out of date software. Huawei has responded with an update available through download that takes up more than 1gb of space, and its quite a lengthy process... They do not do automatic updates like samsung, apple, lg, etc. It's a huge headache.I've also found that it is a little laggy in comparison to my note 4. I have also not had any luck turning off haptic feedback on the keyboard. For me, this is pretty annoying.The camera in my opinion is not as good as you would think either.I think the only upsides to this phone at this point is that you can use a micro SD card in this phone, and I will say the battery life is top notch. I use this phone alot, and only need to charge it after 1.5 days of usage.",OK
Was not able to get updates from Samsung due to phone being sent from another country to the U.S. But love the phone and had no major issues.,OK
Disappointing!would never buy this again.This phone was conceive to do almost anything but it isn't a computer in the sense we expect them to be.I am still wondering what this phone can really do well ... of course it has much more features than the average phone but still I would expect something really solid for that price range...sorry don't know where to start with I may have had unrealistic expectations? but that's what they sell...so rubbish!!! Don't buy my wife has the Galaxy s6 and it is far better...I have now the Lumia XL950 XL DS and no comparison never ever android...,OK
"Mine was one of the many (search ""Nexus 5x camera problems"") with major camera problems. After working for a few weeks -- long enough to outlast Amazon's return policy -- starting the camera would either cause a device restart or the app would show only a black screen. Poor design, poor QA - a black mark for Google and LG. Also, performance is often very laggy, and as many have reported, battery life is weak. If the camera works and when performance is not laggy, it is a good phone.",OK
"it is for my friend who living in Buthan, it would be very usuful for him and his carreer oo",OK
it is a good quality slide text phone but it is super sensitive screen. any slight touch to the screen causes the phone to react or change or call numbers.,OK
"I think it was mildly used, there were Chinese apps installed on it, a Chinese user logged on and the plastic on it was slightly pulled off.But it was in a good condition and nothing is wrong with it so far.",OK
"The sides of the case are so high and the screen protector is so thick that it is hard to type sometimes, especially when you need a key on the edge near the case.",OK
"Cost of cell phone was a steal! Like new. However, the cell phone charger doesn't work anymore. My battery died and I was unable to charge my phone. Thx to my BFF, she took it over to a Verizon store for a charge. Would give a 5-star rating if the charger could be replaced. That would make me very happy and extremely satisfied.",OK
"Overall a great phone but the magnetic charging system is difficult to use, there are tons of software bugs that get very annoying. When you are in a call you are alerted to an incoming call with a beep. If you pull the phone away from your head it will show the incoming call, pull it toward your ear again and it will sometimes automatically answer the incoming call. THIS is not a cheek press but a software bug. I have had problems consistently connecting with bluetooth audio and phone calls. On the plus side the waterproofing is excellent and the camera, including 4k video, is excellent compared to my old Moto X.",OK
"I got this phone as a replacement because I broke my old Blu Life One 2015. It's a clear downgrade but the full price is more expensive than my old phone. The screen size is great, the bezels are amazing, and I like how you can customize the screen color. Plus, It's easily rootable. However, there is some noticeable lag right out of the box which I suspect could be fixed with a software update. The PPI spec wise looked high but the actual quality is okay. The back camera is great but the front facing is grainy and has a red tint to it. I wish i could update to lollipop on it, but as of right now, nothing. If you really want a big screen, go with this phone. I only got this because the Blu Life One 2015 doesn't have any heavy duty cases. If you're okay risking cracking a screen, don't buy this phone, get the Blu Life One 2015 brand new for $149.",OK
"The Item did not meet my expectations. When I started using the phone, the maximum calls I could make was 3 and the battery will die. I emailed the supplier and he sent me a new battery for free yet the problem still exist. The Item is nothing good to talk about but the supplier is one of the best to deal with.",OK
"I would have gave it 5 stars, but I cannot get it to work with AT&T and the cd-rom it comes with doesnt even work. It keeps failing to load and then tries to reload after I removed the cd. I have a HP S5000 series and its only a few months old. I did make most of the phone work and it is exactly like my old Solctice. It actually is a Solctice but for girls. My wife love it and didnt want to return it. Oh well its time for an Iphone. Thanks anyways for the product.",OK
"Samsung galaxy s4 active 11537 far is ok, as advertised and described the phone looks quite new for a used phone, I am impressed so far, it's a month since I received it and no issues yet.",OK
"Cons: Cannot receive picture messages, cannot do screen capture, sometimes when talking on the phone mute button will press onscreen, if I am in a area where there is no signal and move to area with signal it takes a while for it to catch signal again sometimes have to restart the phonePros: Good battery life, easy to use, tiles on home screen easy to use, multiple windows open at same time",OK
"There are currently four non-embedded SIM formats. This phone uses the Micro-SIM (3FF) introduced in 2003 which measures 15mm long x 12mm wide x 0.76mm thick. For those who may have encountered the same oversight, there are articles available on how to trim down a larger format. If you are brave enough to seek out the guidance it is possible you have the manual dexterity and proper tools to safely accomplish the task.",OK
"pretty decent phone... Sometimes it freezes up and doesnt wanna dial but overall, i seem to think its a good phone.",OK
It was a refurbished phone only problems that I could not let go was tap response on screen and battery life and loose volume rockers,OK
phone works most of the time but isnt as reliable as one would hope considering the cost,OK
Touch screen is a little difficult to use. When you want to swipe down the list of contacts sometimes it clicks a contact instead of swiping down,OK
I liked the phone it came in silky condition however I was so dissapointed when I didn't find hand free with the mobile I only found the charger and USB cable along with cellphone inside the Box,OK
"There were problems with getting it delivered on time, which the company did not do well, but I guess that's more on fault of the delivery service being separate... I was too pampered by free same-day delivery in China, I suppose. But the machine had problems with heat that my previous S5 did not have, and it seemed to pause at times. I know people don't usually read manuals anymore, but mine was in Malay or something. That doesn't matter as much as the plug also being in the South East Asian style rather than any actual international style, and even the USB cord was for the older Samsung phones, not the current one, so I had to use one of my spares. All in all, a lot of problems, and not very good communication on the company's side either.",OK
"the external is pretty good. wish the internal system was more simple. keeps trying to get me to get on something to charge me data. internal sucks. and not just cause its an old phone, because its plain set up wrong and inefficient. What are ya gonna do! I wanted a downsize and its doing its job :)",OK
After 2 weeks the technical support of the store finally help me to solve my problem with the phone. Works perfectly but data does not work without wifi.,OK
"It freezes and lags a lot on non-blackberry apps. Specifically, spotify. Music streaming is essential for me, and thus a blackberry, no matter which model, is out of the question. I tried to give the classic a chance but it's just not the phone for me. However it still works pretty well and I love the keyboard so i'll give it a 3/5.",OK
"The top part of the phone is not tight enough. I can only hope that it will last. It was for my 64 years old mother and she ONLY talks on it,that is why we are not returning it.",OK
"This smartphone is very attractive , the LG adds features that are very useful especially KnockOn & KnockCode,also the guest account so you can pay your phone without worrying about what they can to see, the back buttons are an excellent idea, stunning photos and videos of very good quality, the battery lasts 18 hours aproximadamete subjecting it to all possible use. But I had an issue after upgrading to Android 4.4.2 fails to send and receive SMS with the original native application, is solved by installing other messaging application and other point is that the network settings option is not displayed to select 4G LTE. In Venezuela it will works with all operators.",OK
"This phone comes in a kit. The kit is incomplete as the SIM card has been removed. In addition, the phone itself is refurbished. Returned for a refund.",OK
I have no complaints except that it does not work with iOS (iPhone) even though it claims to. There is no app available for Apple and without it the watch is limited to about 15-20% functionality. It's also tricky to figure out. I am tech savvy and I can't figure out what it's doing half the time. There are virtually no instructions all they say is to use the QR scanner on your phone and it will download the app that apparently will explain everything. Trouble is the app is for android only. I had really high hopes for this thing but unfortunately I'm returning it and going another direction.,OK
"Be aware this is NOT a dual sim phone as stated in the questions and answers. It is an RM-1072 Lumia 640 LTE with a single sim. I'm not happy about this, but have decided to keep it. I don't believe this is the seller's fault, but is the either the result of incorrect answers, wrong questions linked to the wrong product, or a change in what the seller used to ship. I like the phone, but would have preferred a dual sim.",OK
This phone looked absolutely brand new. My shipping was very quick too. My only problem is the charging port on the phone is messed up so no matter what charger I use it won't charge after the first full charge.,OK
"I had one of these phones for a year and a half. On a road trip, I tried to sinc the phone with the leased portable Garmin that came with a rental car. I believe someone had a virus or something on the Garmin. It made my touch screen freeze up, rendering the phone pretty much inoperable. Since I am on a fixed budget...I decided to order another phone just like it. It came in great condition and within 5 days from placing my order. It works great. This is no smartphone, but for just phone calls and texting it is great. You can check your email with it, but the screen is small so it is hard to do much online. Could be used in a pinch. Dont buy this phone if you are using it to go online, you will be disappointed. However, if you just use it for calls and texting, it is a great little phone.",OK
"I bought the ""Unlocked"" Lumia 900, but when the product arrived it wasn't. I try to search for a un unlock code somwhere in the invoice or any paper that came with the Cellphone. Finally I had to buy a unlock code over the internet.",OK
"phone had scratches as stated, however it kept telling me I was using the wrong charger",OK
I got the AT&T version of the phone not the version of the S4 shown. Otherwise the phone is okay.,OK
"Shipping was on time, and item is in good shape, but volume control (up & down) quit working within one or two days. I don't know whether or not I can contribute this problem to the seller, but I did not do anything to the phone. Other than the volume, I am happy with the phone.",OK
"Keeps a charge very well, and it lasts a few charges! I just don't like that it is bulky.",OK
Most of the problems were related to the Telestial Europe SIM Card I purchased with it.(see my review for it).It small size was a problem for people of normal sized hands,OK
"Good emergency phone b/c of bomber battery and 2 SIM slots, but beware: no predictive texting (even some several websites say the contrary), which makes it unserviceable for everyday use. I thought the Tank II would be my luddite dream phone: great battery, texting, a little mp3 player. Nice and simple. But I need predictive texting. A better everyday luddite phone: the Nokia 220.",OK
"Phone does not hold a charge, have to charge it at least 2 or 3 times a day, other than that it's a good phone.",OK
The phones functions we're alittle more basic than I expected it to be but overall has great performance .,OK
"Amazing design. Looks and feels like a flagship phone. Speed is great. Screen is very good (too bad it's 720). Battery and charging times are fantastic. Call quality is great. Why three stars? It does not support T-Mobile 4G LTE and the 4G bands it does cover are unusability slow. I really, really, really wanted to love this phone, but lack of LTE bands killed it for me. If fast speeds are not a priority to you, and you want a beautiful, snappy, functional, power sipping phone, then consider this review five stars.",OK
This phone was great but my son had to revert back to 4.2 Kitkat. Cause he had less storage on 5.0 Lollipop then when he reverted back then Boom! more storage. phone was ok but with that bug that's a sad thing to have,OK
I purchased this S5mini phone in August from Shopebest and I have doubts that it was a brand new phone as advertised as it began to give trouble less than a month later - freezing up suddenly or blanking out - leading me to have to do the old time battery pull trick. My previous phone (a samsung young from the same seller) lasted me roughly two years without that kind of problem. I have since had to reboot the phone at least three times a month which is too often for a phone that i've had for less than 6months! 3 stars because outside of this problem the phone is a nice phone. Shopebest needs to do better than that.,OK
I'm giving this item 3 stars simply becaubecat did not work. The description stated that the phone had dual SIM.....the standard SIM was too small. The phone did not read my micro SIM. The phone looked good and simple but unfortunately it did not work.,OK
The phone has more problems then I thought. But came fast which I loved so a 7.5 out of 10,OK
"The phone works so far, but the condition of the phone is ""good"" at best, not ""very good"" as advertised. The outside and inside is scratched up , and has a strange spot on the outside. There was an insert inside the package asking to not write a bad review, but to contact them first, leaving an email address. Sorry, I don't have time for a bunch of emails, a phone number would have beennice. So take my review as you wish, positive or negative, but it is the truth",OK
I bought this case 6 months ago. This case has protected my phone from many drops . The only problem that I have is that the part in the bottom of the phone under the home button gets super loose and looks weird/ out of place.,OK
"Phone battery caught fire after removing from charger, acid all over my hands and clothing!",OK
Good phone but easy to break screen.This thing is also full of ads.Which Burns up your data plan.I wish there was a way to kill the ads.I think it is part of the interface.I had to reset it about every Two weeks.The ads eat up your memory on your phone to.Nice phone just to many flaws in it.,OK
I hate the color. I expected a lighter purple. Instead I got a Barney purple. Yuck,OK
"all round a great phone, but the speaker for music is JUNK. Tons of distortion. carry earbuds or bluetooth speaker if you want to enjoy listening to music.",OK
"El producto llego, en la fecha pautada, y en buen estado, lo malo es q el cable para la carga estaba daÌ±ado.",OK
The device is great BUT the seller and samsung did not mention if you use a sim card to manually put in the network such as tmobile . Luckily tmobile cares and posts the directions on the page: [...] . Great phone and user friendly recommend the phone and somewhat the seller it was on time and received undamaged and all parts where there and like new. I would just like to have had a heads up on the network(phone company) part the reference would have helped.,OK
"Be aware this is not the usual LTE version which many people think is the only one in this model, as I used to think. And yes, the seller states the right reference on Amazon but you must web research about it to get wise. I did it after order it and not too happy about it. I give it 3 stars because they should be clearer on that matter.On any other subject this product is what it says to be, one of the best and fastest in the market.The delivery time was better than expected.",OK
"OK so first off on the waterproof aspect, I've tested it and so far lives up to my expectations. I have fully submerged it while phone was on, I had someone jump into a pull with it and it worked just fine to record the back flip lol. So as far as that's concerned its a great phone! How ever for my complaints, It needs a better description of what the networks this phone will run 4g on and which ones it will not work on. Because as of right now they do not work on At&T's network for 4g...I'm currently running off of 2g. So I definitely feel with a better description I,or anyone else can base their decision to buy or not to buy, better if they added/fixed the description of the phone and it's capabilities.So to end this review if you don't mind not being on 4g networks, and want a cheap waterproof phone this is definitely the phone for you!",OK
There might be a problem in the battery. It charges very slow and go down very fast even I don't use it strongly.,OK
Awkward interfaces. Purchased for my father and its a little too complicated to use for him. Ie not intuitive. Screen completely scratched 2 days in. Ie not a durable screen.,OK
"My boyfriend was very pleased with the phone at first but less than 3 months later, he's havibg some issues. I never have these issues with Apple.",OK
"So far, I like this watch. However, I can't recommend it. First, the instructions were very obviously written by a person who is not literate in English. It was written by someone speaking Chinese using an English language dictionary. Here is a typical sentence: ""Browser need your phone have SIM card and can surf the internet...Please agree the phone book Sync otherwise there is no called phone book."" Further, the instructions as such, are totally incomplete.The FM radio won't function, always asking for non-existing ear phones, for a watch with no ear phone socket. I have no idea how to send a message and there is nothing in the so called instructions to give me a clue.For, the price, I like this watch because of its independent functions.The band broke and I have no idea how to replace it. I'm buying a replacement band for a similarly looking phone and hoping for the best.",OK
"This was an OK phone but I haven't even had it a month the and the speaker blew and it freezes with everything that I do it does it when I call,text and any games very disappointed in this phone but couldn't send it back now I have to order another phone and having trouble deciding which one....",OK
It's an ok phone for the price . Picture quality is low. Kind of awkward to hold. Hard to find any cases to fit at a reasonable price.,OK
The phone is nice physically but I have a problem with it. It freezes from time to time and when it does it prematurely ends the calls. Hence I am concerned about its longevity.,OK
"I had high hopes for this phone based on reviews, but unfortunately the one I got would not connect to my Consumer Cellular/AT&T network. It read the SIM card and contacts and connected on WIFI, but no calling or texts. On the plus side, shipping was right on time, and even though it said 2-4 days after receipt of item for a refund, they posted my refund within an hour of when I dropped it off at the UPS Store! Good customer service!",OK
I bought this phone for my 13 year old son. Other than the fact that it shows that I am connected to my WiFi but I cannot access the internet and the touch response is slow he said it is a kool phone.,OK
Worked great for a long time but then it wouldn't update and I reset it and it wouldn't download my apps or send pictures or screenshot. Pay the extra $40 for a Note II. It's worth it.,OK
"its a phone, it works.... I ordered the N9000, what I got was the upgraded (Jellybean) N9770Internet based apps and browsing like are slow, like dial up slow....UNLESS you are connected to wifi.I've had this for roughly 4 wks now.This phone is NOT 3G, and never picks up 3G signals. I have 3 phones (including this Star9770), all Different carriers. All pick up 3G on my patio EXCEPT this one.so if you don't really care about 2G and not being able to send/receive MMS or browse the internet while you are simultaneously on the phone, then go for it.Me, I'm not so picky, my other phone were on their last legs (but will be emergency back up phones going forward) and I needed something relatively cheap and marginally up-to-date technology wiseAnother thing I should mention, good luck finding a case other than the ugly included cases for this device! There is no using anything other than what comes with it, that I have found...... so far....",OK
It has a problem. Camera is not working properly. Camera is not taking pictures the way is supposed to be.,OK
"Good camera but there is a problem with the screen when I tap it, it doesn't unlock most of the time.",OK
"Item bought as a gift for parents, then returned because they wanted a bigger screen.",OK
It was good after i figure out it was locked an had to pay 25.00 more to get it unlocked rather than send it back,OK
"Let me repeat myself, do NOT update your iPhone 4S. It will cause it to become so incredibly slow with the latest version of iOS 9 that the phone is almost impossible to use without wanting to throw it at a wall or in the trash. It is possible to downgrade to iOS 7 or something, but you need some techie experience. Anyways, this is a good phone to use when you want something cheap. Mine came in like new condition with it being unlocked which I'm happy. Now it's time to get the iPhone 7 now that I got a job. :D",OK
Nice phone but camera stop work after 3 days and showing went wrong I can't figure what went wrong,OK
"The defender case doesn't fit worth a damn. The hole in the screen protector doesn't line up with the home button and looks odd and out of place. I've had three of these cases all with the same issue. Wouldn't recommend this case to anyone, not for this particular phone at least. 3 stars because amazon had great customer service and exchanged the cases.",OK
"I wanted to love this phone. I'd played with one at Micro Center and I thought it would be perfect.Thin. Vibrant. Speedy performance.From the very first time I tried to use it the screen glitched out, almost as if the digitizer and glass screen were making intermittent contact. I had to reboot. It worked for a while, then I had to reboot again. All in all, it was a frustrating, error prone experience.Using the on-screen keyboard was just as frustrating. Misspellings were common, making the phone all but unusable.Audio quality is also muddy and not up to par with some of the better performers on the market.I would steer clear of this model unless you can play with it first and ship it back if it underperforms. Even though the screen is gorgeous, until they fix the quality control it's not worth the risk.",OK
I purchased this just over a month ago so I could be added to a T-Mobile business plan through my job and it's worked wonderfully but it hasn't been able to read the SIM card for the past few days so now I have to do a trade-in with T-Mobile directly.,OK
"The phone is multi- functional and suits my busy life style, it is clean but has been used contrary to the information given as ""never used demo phone"".It functions well except for drop in volume when on a call sometimes. This is a comeback for blackberry.",OK
"I do have to say, it's a step up from the LG Vortex that I was using, however, the seller is very deceptive about this phone. the two things I was the most excited about was the front-facing camera and the rear-facing camera having flash. these are both lies. it does work on page plus, it is unlocked, and it does run pretty smoothly. just don't let everything the seller says fool you.",OK
"The phone was used as expected had many noticeable scratches. It does work and meets the basic needs for my grandson. However, the large enter button that allows access to the menu and other short cuts does not work at all. The phone is worth the price I paid however it was falsely advertised when said to be fully functional when it is not..",OK
"The phone is beautiful, however this review is specifically about this unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy S6. I had the hardest time trying to get a network connection on this phone. I took it to the corporate store of my service provider (Metro PCS) and even they couldn't tell me why I couldn't get a network connection. Luckily the people there could refered me to someone who worked in the vicinity and knew about unlocking cell phones. He told me that because this is an International phone he had to install extra things on it to get it working. I have a 4G connection, not LTE. My guy told me LTE isn't capable on an International phone. So beware the extra steps you will have to take to get this phone working like it's supposed to. Despite that, now that I have a connection I do love it. Besides, there's really no difference between 4G and LTE.",OK
"Went from having a iPhone for at least 10 years and had a couple droid phones in that time frame so it's really hard for me to say for sure. My main problem with these phones because this is my 2nd BLU phoneand Im going to exchange this one also, I love how BLU is so modern and amazing looking but the incoming and outgoing volume, speaker, none of it is good :( the photographey is horrible. Would not purchase again but love the design.",OK
"Just solved our first problem with this phone: after making a call, keypad entries were not sent. Thus, controlling voicemail or directing a call from an auto-answering system was not possible. Found a clue in these reviews that directed us to the Setting, Call, and DTMF Tone setting. This setting needs to be ON. Otherwise, the keypad entry is not sent after a call is connected! Now we can direct calls and control automated answering systems. (Spent time at LG support with 2 emails and 1 chat -- they did not have a clue.)Second problem is the Screen Lock. Even in the OFF setting it continues to lock the screen. Don't know if we can get past this annoyance.Otherwise, we like the phone. It is programmed for AT&T but we are using it on a T-mobile network. Seems OK.",OK
"similar to the first lucid which I liked, but the 2 does not have flash compatibility which is the main reason I go with droids",OK
"Phone works well, however the screen is now popping off the front, I was disappointed to notice this, hopefully just a little glue'll fix it up real nice!",OK
I liked the iphone but after one month I found that its one speaker is not working. I was thinking that everything would be fine because when I was shopping on Amazon there was written that we have tested this item and every thing is working fine. There was a scratch on the body also.,OK
Overall the phone is okay for the price range. This is my 5th BLU phone purchase in the past several years. The battery does not last as long as my BLU Windows Phone so I was a little disappointed. Google Chrome does not work and I have updated it several times and still does not work. The Opera browser is an okay alternative but it is very slow. Every few days the phone will freeze up and will have to be rebooted.,OK
"The LG G2 mini whereby pay was d620r and selling is the d620, in addition to turn them on or off the Vodafone logo appears, however it is a good team in relation price - quality. I'm not 100% as the advertising model deceit why only 3 stars",OK
"My son words, I wish it wasn't activated!! so Mom had to return it.. Very good condition and for the price of phone was reasonable He was very Disappointed...",OK
I turn on my computer I get error says invalid SIM card and occasionally says insert SIM card once you have it inside.,OK
I bought this phone for my mom who is in her 50's. I thought it would be easy for her to manage texting because of the actual keyboard and simple other phone uses.....she liked it. However the phone screen went completely dead after less than 3 months of use. She could not access anything from the phone via the touch screen and some menu options were not accessible via the keys on the keyboard. I ended up buying her a new phone.,OK
"I know it was refurbished, but it came with a big scratch on the screen. It works fine though.",OK
"I like the phone but there is better out there. It won't let me send videos in a text message or post videos to instagram, so I was a little disappointed in that. All in all its pretty good though.",OK
"Came with battery, headphones and charger. Fast shipping. I've had it for about a week and zero issues so far. I'm extremely satisfied. If anything changes, I'll update my post......Update.After about a month this phone keeps freezing up and lagging out. Will contact to replace.",OK
"I bought this phone ""refurbished' for about $200 to replace my 4S that randomly died and never turned back on. After the first few days, I noticed a problem and decided to be proactive and do some research. Turns out it had that notorious battery issue.I went ahead and contacted Apple and within a day they had fixed my phone and I had a new battery. All was good on the western front.Fast forward some time, now my lock button does not work and I cannot lock it. I have to use the assisted touch feature to lock it. Annoying, but of well.Fast forward a few more months, the locking switch on the side has a problem and is constantly locking and unlocking itself. It's always vibrating and drives me crazy!Anyway, those are my annoyance but other than that the phone is fine. Apple really know how to build a shelf life into these things. I think it has been almost a year and my phone battery is barely holding a charge again.Time for the 6? Maybe.",OK
"I enjoyed the phone in the beginning. I hated that it had bloatware, and it keeps trying to push these ASUS apps onto me. Eventually my phone had issues. It turns out this model had a recall. You could call them and they would give you a replacement for like $25 I think.",OK
"I am a S3 owner. I decided to switch to Moto G given performace issues with my current phone, It is almost unusuable (do not take me wrong, S3 is an excellent phone, just that I had high expectations of this high end phone that they weren't totally achieved). I hope to have a better performance with Moto G as a result of the pure Android OS.I haven't received the phone yet so I can give a proper review (I am pretty sure it will be a great phone). However, my complaint is that it is stated that the PHONE IS 4G UNIVERSAL..... why it doesn't work with Band 3 (used in Venezuela)?. I realized this after the pre-order.You can't say ""UNIVERSAL"" when it is actually far from that. Aware overseas buyer of this.It will work in the US with no problem. But if you travel to Europe, Africa or Venezuela, 4G won't work.It could have been totaly UNIVERSAL if Motorola would want so.",OK
It works well and the battery last a long time. It is uncomfortable to talk on for very long it's a $20.00 phone,OK
The item wasnt fully unlock and they didnt send no earphone with the phone so I am a bit disappointed.,OK
"The phone is OK but though it says unlocked, it has all the ATT stuff on it and would be very irritating using it on another network.",OK
Phone arrived as advertised.Can't use phone as a hot spot like I did with my Android.Also can't download all the apps like my Android.,OK
Okay so I bought this phone because it said it was a 4G. But that is a pure life and I only get 3G. I do get H plus whatever the heck that means. Its a nice phone but I'm pretty disappointed about that. Plus the case that I bought is too big for the phone,OK
"Hi, i just got the Samsung Galaxy Europa GT-I5500, it looks great, but the wifi don't work, i have to be 2 feet close to router antena for it works, dont buy this cell phone if you are goin to use the wifi",OK
The charger doesn't work if you won't use it in Europe. My phone came from Iran. Until now it works good.,OK
"It said its new but I got a used one , it has some app's already installed from Middle East but the device it self looks new they should say it's used not new!",OK
"This is indeed a nice phone but it isn't entirely unlocked. I bought this phone to use with Straight Talk and while it will make calls with my Straight Talk Sim card in the phone it will not access data without having a WiFi source. The software in this particular phone will not allow you to change the APN settings in the phone. I'm sure there is some way around this but I couldn't find any instructions on how to do it without rooting the phone which is said to void the warranty and I didn't feel that I should have to go through all of that anyway so the phone is being returned for a refund.Bottom line, if you are an AT&T customer this is a great phone and a good deal. If you are a Straight Talk customer save yourself some time and look for something else.-I would also like to note that i contacted the seller and they were nothing but helpful, I give their customer support an A+",OK
i thought it was ready for att service after taking it to a few stores with no sucess i had a 14 yr old friend of my son,OK
"Phone is great, but had to replace batteries in both phones they wouldn't hold a charge more than a couple of hours lite use. Would give 5 stars if battery was good.",OK
Use it for a while now. So far so good. Only one major problem is can not use for hot spot because the staff who work at T-mobile said it's a AT&T phone. Be careful with that.,OK
Still learning how to use the phone. Purchased for a trip overseas - will know in a couple of weeks whether or not it meets my needs. If so it will have been a great investment. Cons - far too many apps included that cannot be uninstalled. Somewhat slow - a more powerful operating system would be preferred. Will post again following my travels.,OK
"barely had this phone for one year and the ring tone stopped working,had it checked out and now they want to charge 70.00 to fix it with no warranty! doesn't make me happy and I probably will not buy another sony product again....",OK
This phone was okay. The sound doesn't work at all though. I wish they would have put that in the details before I spent money on it.,OK
I just got the phone today! Blackberry 9780 Unlocked! It appears good!I just bought this phone to give to my brother who lives in another country.,OK
Is not the best but the relation between price ans quality its ok...Venezolanos .. es normal.,OK
Starter phone for my child. There are just enough limits to prevent big money problems and just enough features to introduce cellphone usage.,OK
"OTHER THAN THE TOUCHSCREEN NEW OS , GOOD PHONE. GAVE AS A GIFT AND THE PERSON STILL HAS IT FULLY FUNCTION, BATTERY LIFE NO SO GOOD .",OK
I've had this phone for 1 year and 6 months and then it just dies on me... out of the blue it just stays off... tested the battery on another phone and worked... so that's that... it was good while it was working... but not being able to reach 2 year mark... npt good enough...,OK
"Phone is good and has good uniformity over other Android phone, but falls short of iPhone uniformity. Touch sensitivity isn't perfect, nor is the keyboard very good. Language support is poor; keyboards available for only east Asian languages.Otherwise, aesthetically pleasing.",OK
Great phone but the sim card installation instructions were non existent and did not advise that sim card portal must be raised before inserting sim card 1. My card broke and I bent pins in portal.,OK
it worked perfectly find then it ut off while music was playing and the screen went black and it wont turn back on,OK
It's totally not the same like the one I bought many years ago from Sony store. This does not look like a real phone.,OK
"Really nice cell , only thing is that it doesn't work with T-mobile. But other than that really fancy .",OK
"This amazing device has good app's, but still no Whatsapp for it. I'm a little bit disappointed. If you want to be communicated every day with family and friends, don't buy this device.",OK
"Gorgeous phone, but the signal is really weak (I'm on att), normally just fill two bars. And can anyone tell me how to install Samsung pay? I'm really disappointed when play store tells me it's incompatible.",OK
This would have been an okay phone is I could actually set it up with straight talk. The camera is also a little blirry,OK
Perfect for my 11 year old son. Smart phone functions make him feel like a big boy but very sluggish. Still a keeper!,OK
"I had to take the phone to a phone company to get it to work but it's working, it's just a temporary phone. I'm going to use it till I can get the phone I really want.",OK
The battery life is very very poor when you use the phone and I requested a back piece as mine kept falling off. I was told it was shipped but when I got the shipment.... it was two earphone that was mailed and not what I was told. I have taken steps to return to sender because they are no use to me.,OK
"Great hardware and OS but I hate the apps for Windows phones. Developers clearly do not put much effort into making apps for Windows phones. The apps are buggy, unresponsive and missing most of the features included in their Droid counterparts and since I use a lot of apps I will be buying another Android phone and using this one as a back up. Also for some reason when making bluetooth calls in my car I can hear the person I'm talking to but they can't hear me at all which wasn't an issue until I bought this phone.",OK
Good dual sim camera. SMS and wifi great! Takes satisfactory photos.There is no backlight on main menu at bottom as other similar LG phones. Battery life 2-3 days not 800 hours as advertised but still sufficient.,OK
"great phone, great performance. didn't have a problem with the phone at all. would recommend this. I had a problem with the battery, it expanded and didn't work. so maybe you should always have a spare one around.",OK
"The phone was in decent condition when it arrived. However, it started malfunctioning within a few weeks of receiving it. When I inquired on returning the phone for a refund, I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of the return and prompt refund.",OK
"Phone arrived on time as stated and in good condition, but my grouse is that it was not unlocked as I was made to believed.....",OK
"The phone is for my mother who is in a nursing home. I was looking for something with large numbers and easy to use. She keeps shutting the sound off (which isn't helpful) because it is on the side right where someone would hold the phone.The charger is such a strange fit, that I even had to take it to the Verizon store to see if I could get a new one and they don't carry that style anymore. He did get it in and adjusted the opening with a nail file to help the fit.Not what I wanted or expected.",OK
"I like the touch screen and its nice long battery life. However, it freezes up a lot and lots of error messages.",OK
"good afternoon, sorry, I want to know if the package is new tel ..I ask for the images, it appears again!",OK
"The phones were looking as brand new and working perfectly. I bought 2 phones at the time. Both of them were unsealed. They are working perfectly and look like brand new. But inside the box were the headphones that was worth probably 3$. Sound was awful, the buttons were not working. Hardly could plug it in to the phone. So the seller probably switched it and kept the good ones for himself. When we recieved 2 iphones, I went to tmobile and it was not working. They matched the phone in their system and it was reported as a stolen phone but next day the seller changed it to a new one.",OK
"I had bought it because the review was nice, but the only disadvantages was the camera does not have flash, so I could not take photos in the night, other than that it was ok",OK
"I bought this blackberry bold 9780 hoping to arrive as stated in the specification. BUT unfortunately it was not. on the website says it is RCN72UV model but the model that comes to me is RBE41GW. is a model that does not work 3G in my country. IS A PITY THAT HAVE TO FEEL BUYING FROM AMAZON FRUSTRATION. The phone itself is fine, it's new (I think). Battery comes without any details or leave me the impression that it is fake?..............yo compre este blackberry bold 9780 con la esperanza de que llegara tal como decÌ_a en la especificaciÌ_n. PERO lastimosamente no fue asÌ_. en la pÌÁgina web dice que es modelo RCN72UV pero el modelo que me llega es RBE41GW. es un modelo que no funciona 3G en mi paÌ_s. ES UNA LÌSTIMA QUE TENGA QUE SENTIR FRUSTRACIÌÒN COMPRANDO DE AMAZON. El telÌ©fono en sÌ_ esta bien, es nuevo (creo). la baterÌ_a viene sin ningÌ¼n detalle o sea me deja la impresiÌ_n que es falsificado?",OK
I liked the looks of the phone but unfortunately never got to use it since it was missing some parts and I had to return it. But I did so a lot of research on this particular model and it has some nice attributes and a powerful battery. Sorry can't be of more help.,OK
"I chose this phone because I like the features. The problem is when I send multiple text it come back UNSEND. I had to resend it individually. Also some incoming text I am unable to open because it shows a link to download media contact, but when I click on the link it doesn't download.HELP",OK
"I bought the torch from you on May 18th 2011, almost 4 mths ago. it worked fairly ok for the first 2 mths until the screen started blanking off while using it. at first i didn't realise it was a problem, but a week ago it just shut down completely while i was on a call. naturally i assumed it was probably that the battery had died, so i immediately plugged the phone in to charge. the phone has since then never powered back on. it only shows an outline of a battery with a red ""X"" over it. i swapped batteries with another torch thinking maybe the battery life had been outlasted but this is not the case. i have since found out (due to online research)that touch screen blackberrys are somewhat faulty & numerous owners have been having this problem, as indicated by this link [...]. i am seeking some sort of directives in regards to how i can proceed either for a replacement phone or a refund. please contact me via e-mail: hot_number24@hotmail.com",OK
"I expected more about this product, but the problem is that Android consumes a lot of resources that leave the phone stalled sometimes",OK
It's a beautiful phone great all around other than it is very slow. Won't allow us to use 4G. Great for starter phone or spare.,OK
"I am not happy with product it doesn't hold a charge , it blank out it's no good!!! I would like to speak to someone who can help",OK
It was ok just wasn't what I was looking for something I have it to my daughter and she loves it,OK
Makes calls and goes online pretty well but I had to download a separate app for texting since the messaging function is useless.,OK
"I'm reviewing this product about one year later. I received a call from the seller maybe 2 weeks after I purchased to politely ask me to review it. He was a nice man. Unfortunately, either his phone of the first gen Moto X is slightly disappointing in some regards. Don't get me wrong. I love the UI and its performance for the cost. However, I notice that my phone heats up QUICKLY. I bought mine refurbished though.",OK
it holds up to abuse. can't put any apps on it as it has no internal memory space. but I have thrown it across the warehouse and made a call immediately after.,OK
Took over a week to get the phone activated because of Sim verification but I love it now. It arrived in new condition too w/ authentic Samsung charger,OK
"I bougth this Item as an Unblocked cellphone, but when Inserts both sim cards I noticed the is locked, I had to pay extra money to anyone else to unlocking. In otherwise, everything is fine.",OK
You can't watch YouTube videos on this phone but other than that it's a good phone,OK
The product has a lot of scratches but works well. The seller shipped the item very fast.,OK
"So far so good. Found it easy to set up despite being ""techno-challenged"". Is working fine in MX w/Telcel. Haven't tried it in the US, yet, but have no reason to believe it won't work there. It's a great size and weight. Would have given it a 4 if it didn't come w/so many installed apps. They not only crowd the screen, but take up valuable space I would rather use otherwise.",OK
"I love this charger and protector for my iphone. However, my ""certified refurbished"" morphie died just shy of the 90 day warranty period stated on the item page. Beware, as the 90 day warranty period is contrary to Amazon's 30 day warranty period and if you try to return it through Amazon, you will not be able to unless you go through back channels to point the error out to them. However, Amazon promptly addressed my issue and provided numerous options to compensate me for the inconvenience.",OK
Phone in general is good. But wont be satisfied with camera.Camera 2.5/5Phone 4/5 for the price.,OK
"This phones has a great keyboard and decent performance for relatively low specs. The HTC Status is a great texting and messaging phone; however, overall I found the screen size to be a rather limiting feature. The phone would have been much better if HTC got rid of the call and end buttons and enlarged the screen. I would have kept the phone if not for the problem described below. My three star rating is based on the phone itself, and not the problem with the sale.The point of this review is to warn people about the purchase and seller description. I purchase from Cell Lounge Inc. and the device was listed as new but it was in fact refurbished. List correctly if it's a refurb, just say so. It shipped in a refurbished box and had marks on the phone from prior use. Also, the contents where not retail packaging. Amazon needs to enforce seller descriptions. This is the second ""new"" phone I purchased that was refurbished and promptly returned to Amazon.",OK
We were told by carrier that phone was locked. It was not. Just had worthless employee at AT&T. Phone is fine and works well.,OK
"Nice Phone, good cost/benefits ratio, very fast processorIn the other hand, it doesn't allow to have a different ringtone on each line, and it doesn't have good sound when you are in a conversation, my caller says that he can't hear me very clear, me neither to my caller, the sound is very poorWhat I REALLY don't like, is the Verykool's costumer service, it is really awfull, I sent FIVE emails, for a little issue that I had whith the phone and the NEVER answered, the tipical ""Contact Us"" of the Verkool site, its a fake, don't waste your time because they don't answerFor the oposite, Amazon's people are GREAT they were very concern for my problem when I told them about it, and they did as much as they could to solve my problemAnyway, I'm happy with this purchase, for that price, we can't ask too much",OK
"Good but inside component are exposed such that u are likely to break off any component when inserting the SD if not careful enough. This happened to me and i just discovered one tiny component broken because they were not protected or not built away from the SD insert pathway.These smart watch only read or accepts the 32 Gig sized SD cards as its maximum limit.Also, it does not play music over Bluetooth headset. You can't play your music files through the audio player but through file manger. The music audio playback does not play continuously or next audio file.The audio playback stops when u want to use other function.",OK
This cell is a lot smaller than expected. However has a long battery life and is clear This is a .Samsung Galaxy,OK
"Screen not very responsive, but has all applications I need. Mistakenly ordered a touch-screen instead of a QWERTY but otherwise okay. It doesn't seem like a bad phone, though I'm used to the 4g Slide, I just have to get used to the 100% touch screen!",OK
"I'm very concerned about the cellular connectivity of this phone. Compared to my husband's American model Note 2, this phone offers very poor connectivity to AT&T servers. Beware, it does not have 4G LTE capabilities like the phones you get at cellular stores. If I had it to do over, I'd go ahead and pay the extra $200-$300 for the superior cellular data speed and apparently, connectivity capabilities.",OK
"I just purchased this phone. It came in three days. I am completely satisfied with the phone itself, but I do have two issues. I can text and receive texts (as well as iMessages), and all of my apps work (on the Verizon LTE Network) but I CANNOT make or receive phone calls. I find this issue very odd. Also, the battery will be very well charged whether it's 20% or 70% and it will turn off on it's on and when you press the button to turn it on again it says that it is dead and you need to hook up your charger. When I hook up the charger it will still be at the same percentage like 70%. I do not understand why it would do this. So obviously after paying $262, I have to go and purchase a new battery as well. Good phone but almost not worth the hassel.",OK
When used in video call mode (google hangouts) it overheats and hangs within ~15 minutes.,OK
"Hardware is fine. Phone is responsive and I have not encountered lag. It replaced Honor 5X. Just a word of CAUTION - if you intend to use a third party launcher (I've tried Google, Nova, Apex, Z launcher, Arrow and a few others) you will NOT be able to add widgets. It will error out. Other cons - NO LED notifications of any kind - not just for message a but also for charging. NO way to enter a message of the type ""If you find this phone, email so and so"" on the locked screen. Since according to my research it seems that BLU rarely if ever bothers with firmware updates I am contemplating returning it. It's a shame since otherwise it looks like a really nice phone....",OK
"I've had this phone for awhile and over all it works great. Remember there are only 8GB of space so you're going to need an SD card if you want more then a few apps. At random times when you take photos they don't save and that is something that has frustrated me the most. The phone is about the size of an iphone 6 but a little bigger in size and display. The battery life is amazing, i use my phone a lot so it usually lasts for about a day in a half. It is a really easy phone to mod to your liking and use in general. i plan on getting a new phone in the future but overall its a great phone and i recommend it if you're looking for a phone that'll last you 6 months to a year. remember its not the best phone and there isnt a lot of storage but the display is great and it gets the job done.",OK
"Though I am not too big on google, internet based type of phones, I actually like this one. The fact that you can have 2 phone numbers with it and the phone itself is a wifi hotspot (as long as you have data) is very neat. This particular phone only has a 3.2 MP camera which is crappy for those who take a lot of pictures...at least good ones. I, however, take a lot of pictures of my little ones therefore, I exchanged it for the 8.0 MP camera other than that its a fairly good product.",OK
"The phone itself is okay, but problematic coverage-wise on the T-Mobile network. You're better off finding an unlocked T-Mobile version of the phone (such as the Z1S which I now have and LOVE) if your carrier is T-Mobile.After about a year or so having the phone, it would auto-shut off and on...I believe a lot of it had to do with glitches in the last update on it.",OK
It's okay for the money. The BTnotifier that is supposed to work with this doesn't because it out day. I had to go to the Google Play store to get and up to date notifier call Medtech or something to that effect.,OK
"bought this phone in March this year and used it while in East Africa.The phone worked very well on a 3G network...When I got back to the USA, all I did was to take it in to have it registered with Metro PCS and worked very well on an H+ speed which is slower than 4G. If you're looking for a 4GLTE, this is not for you.It works very well for people doing basic stuff.",OK
"Used it for 29 days then it became problematic charging the phone. Have to hold the cable a certain way to charge the phone. The USB port on the phone and the USB cable supplied is very cheap. But otherwise it is a decent phone if you don't need to play games on it. Beware, battery life is lacking.",OK
"It's a more banged up than we thought, but it seems to work fine. All in all satisfied with the purchase.",OK
"It's good to use this cellphone so far. Picture quality needs to improve more up to 1 million colors instead of only 256 colors, !!!!",OK
over all i think that the phone was a good deal i had it shipped to my house in good condition next time you just need to clean the memorycard out.,OK
"Works well with T Mobile. The screen is a little small which can cause eye fatigue. Overall, it does an adequate job with wifi.",OK
For the price it is a good phone! The only gripe I have is it sometimes restarts after saying it ran into a problem with the system!,OK
"Good solid phone, pretty heavy. Have had to pull the battery out a few times to get the phone to unfreeze.",OK
THE PHONE: its good but the fetures is not like the samsung galaxy s3 mini s4 mini and the popups is small er,OK
My tagital tablet isn't working I think factory fault is the problem. Please what should I do as to return it,OK
"The phone box was of T-mobile, did not say samsung on nowhere.It had no user manual, and nor had the headphones.only was a box with the phone and the charger.immediately I had a bad impression.The phone turn off suddenly and it is not programmed for that, and it not return to turn on, after a while.the phone is not bad, but i not recommended buy it with this supplier.",OK
"Purchased about 2-3 months ago, and so far so good.Except for that the battery cannot handle being charged over night, otherwise, drains like crazy during the day. Therefore, I charge no more than 90% to be safe. Odd I know, reviews say it's the software. There can be no apps running in the background or not even in use during the day that before you know it it's at 30%.Other than that... great sleek, water&dust proof cell which I hope last awhile!",OK
I had a Samsung galaxy 4. OK for the price. Still getting use to it. Don't like text feature,OK
This item arrived without a battery. I had to purchase a new battery out of pocket despite the reports that I submitted.,OK
"Althoug it says it works perfectly on 900 and 1800 MHz, it doesn't. It has the same glitches I used to have on my 520. A lot of apps that crash or that don't work correctly. Other than that the product was brand new and the unlock code worked perfectly. This just might be the last Windows Phone I ever have.",OK
"I've had the phone for a few weeks and it accomplishes the basics - calls, texting, browsing. I do enjoy the familiarity of a Windows operating system, but I can't imagine attempting to write documents on a small screen. Unfortunately, I found out too late - it's not on Microsoft's list of upgrades to Windows 10 (not even a Windows Insider Preview). Which leaves me with a scarce amount of apps to use). The dual facing camera is nothing out of the ordinary, but there are a few sweet apps to make shooting pics entertaining. The simplest feature I enjoy...easily locating apps in alphabetical order!",OK
"It's so, so. Very small for a smart phone & worth the investment to purchase a larger one. Screen small, texting keys far apart, OVI maps you have to squint to see of which isn't good while driving. It's a great phone for a teenager however.",OK
"Beautiful device it was labeled locked so i figured it was sprint only but the phone had a Verizon account on it that was active i call myself a few times in disbelief to make sure, im returning it with hope that i could receive another one under sprints network that i could put under my account",OK
the user interface is god awful. So difficult to do anything and figuring out how to use it initially is a nightmare. I should have bought a $120 nokia and just stomached the higher price.,OK
"I fell in love with this phone before buying it. When I received it, it was just what I needed. I like being different. The only problem with this phone is the fact that it can not send or receive picture messages. I've bought cheaper phones that do send and receive picture messages but this one just wouldn't! Looks like ""You can't have everything you need!"". I called my network service provider (Simple Mobile) several times but this issue couldn't be resolved. That means i can only use apps like WhatsApp (not everybody has phones that do support this app) to send and/or receive picture messages. I truly enjoy sending instant picture messages to my phone book contacts; it aches my heart and I'm ashamed presently to brag about my phone, since deep in me I know there are simple things it can't just do!",OK
It contains softwhere from a Germany Company ....impossible to erase... and nobody talked at the description about. That was a bit disappointing. However... the cellphone is amazing as I expected,OK
"El articulo Bakcberry RCK71CW 9550 fue recibido en la fecha prevista, sin embargo no viene en su paquete original, no trajo los audifonos,el manual y el CD Destktop.",OK
"This Note 4 works okay with Cricket Wireless, but only includes three of the five band that Cricket uses. Also, Cricket said that it was an European phone instead of a USA phone and that was why it didn't contain all of the five frequency bands used by Cricket. We were tokd that the phone should work okay but would not work as efficiently as a USA phone and may not be able to receive as strong a signal as a phone with all five of the frequency bands that work with Cricket wireless. So far it has worked okay except when we were in the Dominican Republic on vacation last week. It would not allow messaging at all! So, good uck if you purchased this cell phone from this vendor.",OK
"This is an excellent phone the reason I give 3 stars is because one of two bought was blocked and two without the Spanish language, this genre additional spending to solve the problem, other than that everything else is very well the shipping was fast",OK
Won't work with fingerprint and it is not waterproof. The case seems to be low quality compared to other levels of Otterbox that I have used.,OK
"Because it was a top N Series and most expensive cellphone at Nokia during a couple months, I expected more to this investment. A lot of bugs - some solving with 2.0 Firmware, some not - like bad first Facebook app (now, better). The problem with landing page (the page of gadgets) continues I think because this stout cellphone needs a Intel processador - may be - like Duo Core for Nokia :). I really believe if this could possible, this Nokia N97 might be better than seems...The camera looks like ok, but always when I take a picture with flash, the weard fog appears in the corner below, left side...Istead of I like the qwerty keyboard it's ok and the apps available could be better in Ovi portal.",OK
A little heavy. Not many apps available. No automatic focus in camera will not take pictures when subject moves just a little. Will not allow me to add memory.,OK
"Was advertised as new but it wasn't, the screen didn't have the peel off plastic cover on it that new phones come with, and there was pocket lint in the buttons and behind the battery cover (outside the water proof'd area which is good). When I took off the battery cover (very carefully just as I have done successfully with many other phones) 4 of the clips were broken off (I'm buying a new 1 about 30$). The gps isnt working well +-50 feet, going to try recalibrating it. The phone is otherwise flawless about a month in.",OK
I Love this Phone!!! OMG!! But it broke on the 5th day screen went out,OK
Like the shape and colour. Bigger screen. Light and thin. Most people use this phone. Can have a memory card,OK
"This phone will arrive with an European travel charger. You either need to carry an adapter with you all the time or spend another $15-$50 to buy an OEM/Original Samsung Travel Charger. This is the first time I bought an electronic device from amazon.com with a non-compatible charger in North America.I love the phone and I would give it 5 stars. I had been iPhone user since iPhone 3G. But I returned my iphone 6 and got a s6 edge. I love the design, the feel and the features.",OK
The phone is very nice only problem is that my speaker is kinda muffled so I have to put everyone on speaker unless I have my headphones in.,OK
This item is a refurbished machine. The colour of this item I purchased is different with the colour of item in the picture.,OK
got shipped to me right away and worked well but it had a lot of scratches on front glass screen part and a lot of chips around the edge of the phone. wish he would've been more straight up with me about the shape of the phone.,OK
"The phone is excellent, but the announcement say that include flip case, and it's false and neither has the headphones.",OK
"good budget phone, don't expect to use a lot of app at the same time.",OK
this phone would be perfect if it wasn't for the battery life. with moderate-high use i'm lucky if it lasts 4 hours.,OK
"My main issue with this phone is the ultra sensitive touchscreen. Sometimes when I'm scrolling i find myself selecting stuff when all I'm doing is scrolling. Other times stuff are selected without me or any object touch the screen, the only thing that's touching it is air. This can be extremely annoying at times. Other than this issue I have no other problems with the phone. The camera is great, it's fast and doesn't lag whatsoever. In my opinion it's a great phone, only the issue with the sensitive touchscreen is really the only thing that's killing this phone.",OK
