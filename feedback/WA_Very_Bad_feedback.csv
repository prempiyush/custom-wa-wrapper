I bought 2 of these... evrything was ok the first 2 days. When i connected them on my pc it says: Huaei 8900 WTF!?,Very_Bad
"the phone was in visually excellent condition, but some how it went through refurbishment without being able to be charged. not very useful without power.",Very_Bad
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,Very_Bad
Too bulky.My wife has the otterbox for iPhone 6 and it is not so bulky. This one looks ugly as hell and screen visibility is greatly affected.,Very_Bad
"So the device came with touch screen issues from day 1:The pen would still work but the device became completely unresponsive to finger touch. I removed the battery and rebooted the device, this is when it started working back again... The device went without issues for about a week and a half or so but issues resurfaced. I thought it was a software glitch but it turned out that there are many others on the web facing the same issues. I stayed hopeful to get a Samsung update fix. Issues disappeared for a while but resurfaced more and more until now, my touch is completely unresponsive. I contacted the seller and they told me that Samsung does not offer any warranty on this model! (The seller has a 2 week warranty - which is also ridiculous for such products).I'm very pissed off at the warranty length especially that it's not mentioned in here.",Very_Bad
Is not working and I coundn't return on time. So I wasted my money. This was a bad desition. I regret about that.,Very_Bad
This phone came with a malfunctioning battery that was $80 to replace because the phone was purchased over 3 years ago. The seller clearly knew about the issue and decided to pawn off the problem to an innocent buyer. The camera also failed the diagnostics test--another problem that was not made apparent until after purchase. It is ridiculous to not be notified of this upon purchase. I looked through several other phones and decided this one was the best choice because i was not made aware by the seller that the phone was not able to function. I am extremely frustrated with the results and hope that no one else has to experience this ridiculousness.,Very_Bad
"Phone not worth the money, I had the phone for just over three months and it started to run really slow and a delayed reaction when you hit any key. Then the phone started to overheat. I contacted blu and had to send my phone in. Which took about a total of two weeks to get it back. While they had the phone they sent me an email saying issued part was a battery. When I got the phone back it didn't have a new battery so I called and asked them about it. They said sorry we sent you a different phone. I told them that the battery was still overheating and they told me it would be another 15 to 20 business days before I would get my phone back. I'm not at all happy with this product. I would not suggesting buying the product because you have to go through such a hassle to get it fixed under the warranty that came with it.",Very_Bad
"Product with many defects, atrial bad bands unusable for my carrier (not specified in the product description). not filled at all my expectations.",Very_Bad

"I bought 2 of those phones and there are different, the buttons on the sides..one of them is made of plastic and the other one is made of metal. The logo on the back of AT&T its a little bit different between them. One of the phones have SIM slot gasket, the other one is missing. And the big problem that I have on the phone is that, most of the time people can not hear me at all and it happened the second day after I bought the phone...I can hear them but they can not hear me, its very annoying. Very disappointed.DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!",Very_Bad
The Phone does all kinds of things on its own. You dial the number 2 the phone dials 0 and so on. I bought the phone for my mother and she hates the phone. Wish I would have returned it.,Very_Bad

"The unit is associated with whoever bought them on tmobile. Using the IMEI, they can call the carrier to have this blocked. They can do this after the 120 days after you bought it here. A timeframe needed to return the item. So whoever sold me(Amazon seller: Cali-Wholesale)the unit also applied a claim for replacement on the insurance. It has been working since May until today which I no longer have service due to a blocked imei. Amazon guarantee program is currently trying to assist me with this, I will keep you posted. I advice anyone to buy at apple if you plan to keep it for peace of mind.",Very_Bad

This is the worst phone ever. I dnt knw if it's bcuz this fone is a verizon branded fone but since I bought it I am not pleased. 1.I can't send text msgs as the fone keeps changing the msg centre number. 2. My email accounts could nt b activated-had to pay a technician to wipe the phone before I was able to wipe the phone b4 I was able to add my accounts. 3. The keyboard goes blank every now and then 4. I am nt able to restore my bb contacts after upgradinf the software (though I had already done so previously).Total waste of money. I just wanna get rid of this fone,Very_Bad
The phone was sent to me with the water markings being altered due to it having damage. The phone would not work at all!,Very_Bad

After this item was shipped out it took 3 weeks to receive. Then i figured out that everytime the phone turns off I can't turn it back on without a charger. I messaged the company about this right away and never received a message back. I'm very disappointed.,Very_Bad
"the mobile is not working after one month and half only of usage how can i believe that , bad experience",Very_Bad
The phone is locked which is not clear in specification. In reviews one review says it works with all companies which is not true. This is a deception. Unfortunately is is fulfillment by Amazon,Very_Bad
"We paid a premium for a new, unlocked cell. It didn't look new and the phone was definitely not unlocked. Amazon was noisy but not helpful at all. The seller began by saying it was unlocked but became more co-operative when we told him we were trying to get AT&T to unlock it. Anyone who has done this knows how difficult it can be esp. since we have a live contract with AT&T. We chose to do this because we had sent the cell to my son in Europe and getting unlocked seemed like the best route. It has taken weeks of 'dialog' and calls. In the end AT&T has come through and I will release payment from American Express card to Amazon and the seller when we are sure the cell does work. My recommendation is to use American Express because they will back you up in Hokey circumstances like this. Amazon and the seller were useless.",Very_Bad
"Phones are not new as advertised, say new on the box but have been previously used. Scam.",Very_Bad

This phone is not at all that great. I only had it for about 3 months and I'm already having problems. Charge doesn't work. I lose signal all the time. The camera isn't that great. Just horrible. I'd rather have my money back,Very_Bad
The phone stop working after one week..what a waste? I cant even send it back to sony for repair because it doesn't have an IMEI code,Very_Bad
"So far I am happy with the phone. It is not activated yet it's a Christmas presant so I hope I don't have any problems activating it with straight talk. The phone was delivered in 4 days faster than what they estimated which is great, phone was in apple I phone box wrapped with plastic around box, came with charger, and ear phones, if the phone is not brand new it is very close to it. No scratches, no cracked screen better yet screen had a protective cover over it.",Very_Bad
"If there was an option to give a negative star or NO star rating I would. So I HAVE to give it one star. This phone is total GARBAGE. It shuts off whenever, the blue tooth has to be turned on EVERY time (maybe because it shuts off 20 times/day), doesn't show missed calls, doesn't ring sometimes when people call. The only thing that COULD be useful about this phone is taking a hammer to it to get out your frustrations. It's JUNK. My husband needs this phone for his business every day or I would return it. I don't foresee it lasting more than a few months and that would be if it doesn't get put in front of a tire to run it over. Amazon should not sell this phone!!!!!! Even if it was half the price it's still not hardly worth it. If it wasn't such a process to activate another phone I would have sent this one back!",Very_Bad
I had a lot of problems with this phone. I took it to Verizon and was told that it was defective. I was forced to buy a more expensive phone on the spot because this one was of no use to me. Very disappointed.,Very_Bad

"While this phone says Sprint right on the face of it, it appears it was a South American market phoneand cannot be activated in the North American market. When I asked for a refund seller would not pick up thereturn shipping charges. I then read all the seller reviews. Guess what I figured out. Seller has sold more thenone of these that will not activate. It then occurred to me that I had the one that will not activate.I decided to just go ahead and THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE. This way no one Else's time and money will be wasted.Pete",Very_Bad
"Worked ok for almost 4months, just after the warranty ran out. Advertised as a new phone, but upon deeper inspection with a magnifying glass, I doubt it. A company (Freewire Mobile) that works harder on dressing up a worn out phone with a new case and new protective sticker and calling it a new phone than selling a honest product. Of course lets not forget the "" were sorry but we can't do anything for you"" brushoff. Oh well, live and learn, but a company that operates this way is a one hit wonder. You won't be around long.",Very_Bad
"This phone was said to be in great working condition. It was far from it. The battery lasted for 2 hours if you were lucky, and could take up to 30 minutes to send one text message.

"Phone shuts off randomly, overheating and making zapping noises before it shuts off. Cord that came with the phone isn't right either. Battery too warm. Phone appeared to be new in the packaging but seller refused to say if it was new or a refurb. I believe it was advertised as new ( as in new old stock) as Lg doesn't make this phone anymore. So...I'm sending it back.",Very_Bad

I'm going to tell you where my Galaxy S has this phone beat first batter life on my Galaxy S is better second the touch screen on my G'S is better third G'S internet speed much better because the optimus starts with a 2G suggested use for longer battery life it's a joke really. The only thing this other phone has is the 2way camara. Lesson learned if ever I want an upgraded phone I'm sticking to Samsung, in all honesty I wanted the Galaxy note just way expensive.",Very_Bad

"Great phone, looks great, feels great, not as bulky as iphone 6 plus which is my current phone. I really wanted this phone, which deserves a five star no problem...However, I have to return this phone because it is not unlocked as the seller has promised in the item description.

Then I found out there are stupid Vodafone widgets on the home screen and apps in the app menu.

I called AT&T technical assistance for help, and they immediately asked me for the IMEI number on the phone. They then explained that the broken phone US Wireless sold me was not NEW, and that it was a refurbished phone that was over 2 years old.

"The phone has been nothing short of frustrating and obviously a very low quality product outside of photos. It is also not very user friendly, it is my opinion that you should be able to put in your sim card and enjoy the many feature and benefits that you have with your previous android phone even simple ones like call forwarding! I can go on and on about the user unfriendliness of this phone which some could be blamed on the user (me) that really doesn't feel they should have to read a book to learn to use the phones most basic functions. All I do is email, text, and use the calling options. there settings menu basically has nothing in it that is useful at all.The worst part is the phone will tell you there is no data connection available while at the same time my work phone has a perfect connection on the same network.",Very_Bad

A terrible screen (the pictures in the listing seem touched up), an unstable OS, and barely enough on-phone storage to run the apps it comes with, including some ridiculous storage-hogging DRM apps. I could not get some critical apps like Facebook, TripIt, and Chrome to work on this phone because they all use up too much on-phone storage...even when a microSD card is installed.This phone was so unworkable that even after trying to install several third party Android ROMs, I gave up and bought an LG phone instead.",Very_Bad

"I bought this HTC Magic for use while traveling outside the US, but I couldn't get it to work. My first suspicion came when I opened the box and found that it was a T-Mobile branded phone. Well, it was advertised as unlocked, so what could go wrong?When I turned on the phone it took me to an Android screen and asked me to click on the Green Monster to begin. When I click it tried to connect to some ""server"", hangs for a few minutes, and fails. I tried different SIM cards for different networks, same result. I tried a SIM that has internet connectivity, failed again.To make matters worse this phone does not appear to have wi-fi, so there is no other way to connect to Google's server's except through the phone network, which I can only assume is still tied to T-Mobile. There are many newer phones that offer both wifi and Bluetooth for less money.I returned the phone without ever getting past the welcome screen. One star for wasting my time and effort.",Very_Bad

"I bought this phone at the end of May. By the end of July, the screen was unresponsive most of the time. There is no water damage, no major drops or anything like that. The screen is not cracked or physically broken. I messaged the company, since I had it less than two months and there wasn't an obvious reason it stopped working. They recommended a hard restart. That didn't work. I asked the company to either replace the phone with a similar condition or replace the screen, since I owned it less than 60 days. The company told me to kick rocks since their warranty period is 30 days. Now the screen is 95% unresponsive, text keyboard doesn't work, and luckily I can use Siri to make phone calls and text (can't answer the phone most of the time). I could understand if a refurbished phone doesn't last forever, but less than 60 days?! Come on!",Very_Bad

Hate this phone. Had a busted up Samsung Note 2 and there is a huge difference... My old beat up Samsung was superior! You cannot block calls or texts using this Moto X device. I downloaded several apps just to try to block numbers and texts on this phone with no luck. Spend the extra money to buy a better phone.

Could not return it.The phone hangs now and then. The touch is not responsive sometime. So becomes impossible to unlock the screen. Only solution is to remove battery and start the phone again. The battery has some issues also. At night, the charge is around 60%. In the morning, it is found switched off. Need to charge it to start. It happened several times and no application was on that can drain this much battery. The ringtone at max is not high enough. Becomes hot after 5 minute of use.I bought this phone because LG G3 has a good user review.

"Awful experience with the phone but excellent experience with Amazon.I bought this phone as a replacement for an already-owned but dead Nokia 920. The phone started freezing up, and requiring the ""soft boot"" procedure. I tried Nokia support several times, and even went into a MicroSoft store for a check up. An internet search revealed that this freezing is a common problem, and that Nokia finally admits that it is a hardware problem.. but I was unable to get that response from them directly. Amazon took the phone back and I had my refund the day after I mailed it back. For $60 I was able to get the original 920 phone fixed... and that phone still keeps chugging along.",Very_Bad

This unscrupulous practice makes me want to buy some where else. What say U.After arguing with some 1 @ amazon for 15 minutes they finally give me a $13. + credit on my next purchase. My concern is does this same policy apply to the hundreds of dollars I have spent with Amazon in the past year, or so. That's the question I would like an answer to.

"The phone was not working from the moment I received. When the charger or usb cable is attached the phone turns off automatically and does not charge at all. Unfortunately, I had to leave the country the day it arrived and could not return it. Apparently, this is a common problem with this particular type, and I believe the seller was aware of it too since it sold me a refurbished phone that it claimed was new.",Very_Bad
This phone came very clean. No scratches at all. Looks like it just came out for the first time. But.... Once power on it would not hold a charge...Then the most horrible part of it was the speakers. They sounded horrible and I couldn't even hear the ring tones and It was to its loudes. Phone is refurbished it look great but the only reason I return it was cause the speakers sounded like s**t,Very_Bad

Then I was sent another one and now this one has problems. The screen freezes more frequently now, the texting features don't work. I have not dropped this phone, but it sure feels like that this had problems since the day I got it. I should have returned it completely instead of getting a replacement. I bought this as my S3 charging port went bad after 3 years and I didn't have any other problems other than that. I should've just replaced the charging port and it could've resolved my issues. I'm highly disapointed that after spending almost $200 and my phone's already malfunctioning.",Very_Bad
I bought this s6 from SurgeTelecom on amazon and at first it seemed fine. but then i noticed the battery life was not so good. it would die about halfway through the day. Then the screen became very unresponsive. About 3 out of 4 times touching the screen had no effect at all. i returned it and bought an s6 sold by amazon with neither problem so far. This may be my imagination but after getting my second s6 i feel like the first one was lighter than the second one. After reading other reviews i'm starting to think this seller either sells refurbished or knock off phones.,Very_Bad

"While the specs are quite good. The phone suffers from some really serious lag issues. While this phone shouldn't be compared to a higher end phone.

This has to be a problem with the stock software as the other phones have roughly the same specs, yet run very smooth and responsive.",Very_Bad
"Phone lasted 4 months. The phone looked good on paper, but in reality it died after 4 months of usage. Contacting Customer support has not been easy. I purchased 3 of these phones, 1 works really well, 1 died, and another one is on life support and may soon be going back to Blu for service.

Reset instructions received by email did not work. After mailing phone to Blu, they sent intimidating legalese about investigating if phone qualified for 1 yr warranty. After almost 3 weeks I have no phone! Blu knows about this defect yet pretends its customers' fault. Lots of documented customer complaints on the web.

"Skip this one. Very buggy still after a year of patching. Device keeps giving pop ups like it knows best. Keeps asking to connect to their BBM message app after repeatedly saying no I don't want your junk. I had to install it just to shut it up. Pop up asking to connect to WiFi even when shut off. Many of these issues that just makes the whole experience frustrating. All of this is just indicative of the attitude BlackBerry has of them assuming they know what's best for u and thinking they are too smart to be ignored. Horrible attention to program design. I mean how can u screw up an android os? Well BlackBerry managed to somehow. If this was my first Android device used, I'd think Google was to blame but thank God I had a Samsung Galaxy to know android os is actually real easy to use and is not like an annoying salesman that won't go away.I'm not gonna waste anymore time with this device including writing this review.

I contacted Nokia and they said the product is damaged and can not be repaired. I contacted the seller for return/replacement but never heard back from them. I am really disappointed with the phone.,Very_Bad

"When you download games from google play store it wants you to download google play which is usually the way it works. Problem is, if you do that then you have no room for any other apps whatsoever. I even added a 16 GB SD card and it still won't work. You can set the phone to send all downloads and data to the sad cardand that won't even work. I had to factory reset the phone to clear it out for my daughter to download a music playing app. Even then she can only add two games if they are small ones. Can't add YouTube or even the new Pokemon game. Big bummer for her. She can use it as a phone though. Lol.

"I purchased the phone in February. It worked super great. Loved the camera, loved the options and all my apps. I was super careful with it. Then one day in May the screen stopped working. I tried all the possible sollutions. I even contacted the seller to ask about the warranty. BUT, I never got a simple responce from the seller :( Then I called the customer service and found out that the phone didn't have a warranty in the US... To repair the screen will be from 150$ and up...and from all the research I've done so far - it's a common thing for Nokia Lumia 1020 to have such issues... Next time, it would be nice, if the seller notifies the customer, that the expensive purchase they are about to make will not be covered by the factory warranty...So 1 star is to the seller and 2 stars to the phone itself because of the issue.",Very_Bad

I leave this phone on airplane mode and only listen to slacker radio via wifi. With that said, the battery last close to 4 hours. Only one speaker works. This being my first iphone I don't know if it's an iPhone problem or the seller problem. This product comes with a cheap charger. If you really need to buy this product, buy yourself an extra charger. My charger lasted a week even with the fact that this phone get very little use.

"UPDATED - 1 Star due to the complete lack of support on this product. This comes with Android 5.0 not 5.1 or 5.0.2 or 5.0.1, but the buggy original Android 5.0 with no updates in sight. Phone lags considerably, touch screen is unresponsive, and touch drag operations almost always result in the phone thinking you've let go. An update came out a few weeks that actually made things worse. Customer service has no idea about updates and Blu's website doesn't give ANY information about updates. Don't waste your money on this phone.I would give 4 or 5 stars, but Andriod 5.0 unpatched is VERY buggy and sluggish. Bluetooth won't see devices and I have to reboot to clear out issues. Support site is terrible. No news about updates. Having Lollipop for bragging rights to sell phones without supporting necessary bug fixes is not a successful long term business strategy.PLEASE push out updates soon and COMMUNICATE that to your customers.",Very_Bad

The pen also makes a funny shaking noise that it isn't supposed to make (I have another note 4 that is working perfectly) so I know how it is supposed to run. The charger that came with the phone is pure junk that they probably bought from the dollar store. It looses power when it is actually plugged in. On the subject of power, it will not keep a charge. For the first 50% it's golden and perfect but the moment it hits below 50 it plummets and it will automatically turn off anywhere between 30% and 3% with no warning.

I researched for hours to figure out how to get it to work again. I ended up finding it would still boot to recovery mode however it wont charge in recovery mode. so then I left it on the charger for upwards of 4 hours. It turned on at 2 % and charged. I thought the storm had passed. then two days later it failed again while the battery was at 100%. This saga continued for a week. I even contacted Motorola's customer support. it would have cost me the price of the phone to fix it which is bull because i had it less than a year and it was clearly defective. save yourself the trouble the videos and guides to fix the issues with this phone are all basically plug it in and pray until it works.

"I bought this HTC Explorer A310e Unlocked GSM Phone as a gift for my Mom. She started using the phone on December 6th,2013. Within couple of days they noticed the display to be flickering and displaying nothing. This issue occurs frequently and they had to remove the battery and place it again for it to work again. Unfortunately my parents are in India so I won't be able to return the phone to Amazon. I contacted the Customer Service to check if they would be able to help, they just replied asking me to take the phone to a repair shop to get it repaired... Grrrrr. I'm not sure what they mean by Amazon A-Z guarantee. The display costs as much as the phone itself so no point spending more money on this defective phone. I should have thought and bought this phone from a genuine dealer. Guys, please spend some extra bucks and buy from a genuine dealer. Please don't buy and regret as I do.",Very_Bad
"Actually 0 stars. This has to be the worst thing I ever bought on Amazon.First the battery dies really fast, then the hotspot doesn't last even when u put money in it. It takes so much data it's crazy. How can I return this nonsense I bought.",Very_Bad
"This is worst Phone ever made by Samsung, Slowest, dumb, Low end Phone, its not able to simple task, like fast texting, camera operating, or even taking time to open phone directory, This phone is worst for handling two sims at once, Cant even run internet smoothly, I used hundreds of Mobile phones, but never seen worst dumb phone like this.

"Yeah, literally had 10 minutes of use before the back panel broke. Had a case on it, but the phone is does not have enough structural support and flexes too much. Knew I should have gotten the z5 compact, but took a chance on this just because of the magnetic charging so I wouldn't have to worry about the usb connector giving out.UPDATE 7/24/26So I've had this a few weeks now, I have to lower my rating, wish I could give it 0 stars. lollipop killed the battery life so I went back-to-back kitkat and that solved that. the big problem is the microphone doesnt work correctly unless you take a call on speaker. This is a software issue but I've tried all the ""fixes"" suggested on the Web and none have worked. I understand why Sony never had any success in the US mobile market, this phone is plagued with so many issues.",Very_Bad

This phone worked for a few days then could not be predictably turned on even with a fully charged battery.

"phone was just what I wanted. Once I received it and started to personalize it, I realized, when I was having difficulty with something as simple as choosing the language and keyboard style that this phone was Chinese.

"I love my Jitterbug flip phone and I bought this model because I wanted to download special apps.

T-Mobile talked Alcatel into removing band 12 now I have no LTE signal another piece of junk T-Mobile phone.

"The screen broke and began showing stripes after a month (hardware defect).

This phone does not work very well. My husband and I have the same cell phone carrier and his phone drops calls and loses signal in places where mine doesn't so it is the phone; not the cell service. I don't know if it because this phone came from China or what but it is awful,Very_Bad

I sent it back tell them this. They told me they'd send me a new phone. That didn't help because it was the same damn problem. I told them a second time. And they said they'll sned me a 3rd phone, I said forget it. The phone itself was alright for a good cheap phone. I broke my iPhone and I was desperate for a phone. But after that experience i didn't care.",Very_Bad
"I usually hate writing reviews, still do. However I think it was necessary to share about this phone. I was really excited to get my new samsung galaxy, but upon opening the box, I realise something was off. First off the phone did not come in its original packaging and the accessories were somewhat questionable. Upon using the phone I also realise the battery life is really bad.",Very_Bad
"This is not a new phone as advertised. It had other numbers already stored in it. I received this phone in mid-January and it quit being able to receive or make calls within 2weeks of receiving it.

"the camera is awesome, it is leaps and bounds beyond anything on the market. It has ample space to storage any and all media, however the phone is absolutely $#!+. The battery is touted as comparable to a Galaxy S6, that's not true. It takes 8 hours to charge the phone if you don't have the bulky hub they provided. It has connectivity issues. It seems not to be able to reconnect with a saved network if you were away for a few hours.",Very_Bad
Unfortunately the product did not meet my expectations. I could not update the version of IOS (was only in the number 4). This shows that the device was unlocked not in the way that appears in the ad. I had to pay a technical assistance that confirmed the problem. I would return it and get my money back. I bought two devices on two different dates and two had the same problem.,Very_Bad

"Unfortunately the phone although listed as a Verizon phone must have been flashed as indicated by Verizon. They cannot activate the phone.

"I have about 4 of these 8300 over many years. I like it for a basic phone. Unfortunately the replacement I bought on Amazon *(first time) had problems. The zero key doesn't always work and this week the voice microphone went out so I can only use speaker. Furthermore Verizon doesn't not send OS updates to the phone so the new phone is several version behind my older phone. Very disappointing. Oh and I don't see a warranty on the phone,.",Very_Bad
I have had this phone for less than 2 months and it has been a nightmare. It's always overheating. It shuts down when the phone rings. Last evening my phone rang once and it shut down during the ring. I have not been able to reboot it since it has been 15 hours. I would like to have something good to say about this phone but I received a faulty phone. Frankly speaking I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!Another thing is the manual it's not helpful at all. There are no instructions. I once wrote to inquire how to transfer to the SD Card the response was to look in the manual. The manual says nothing about that.I am so disappointed.,Very_Bad

If I increase the brightness still it's same, unable to read messages because of the worst brightness. The camara doesn't work. It has low quality camara. Usually HTC mobile's has good name on camera quality but this one is worst. I ever seen like this piece. My friends who used this same piece they got good one but I got bad one. Frankly I don't blame HTC brand but I do blame Amazon. They only sent us that piece.",Very_Bad
"I was really hoping this phone was useful, especially the camera, but I found the camera to be no better than the previous Android Oneplus phone I had. Sadly, the phone was also slow & lagging.

I've also had to send in an unlock request because i cant delete the old at&t apn from my phone. This is 100% probably hit or miss that they actually did unlock the phone, and that's why this title is 100% misleading because my phone was not unlocked. thanks for the hassle.",Very_Bad

I was not happy at all. When I received the phone it did not work you could not hear the person on the other end. When I made contact I did receive a return label timely but if I received a broken product I should not have to pay shipping and handling but I did. Also I was expecting for it to be resolved before Christmas due it was a gift. So for me I will not recommend this company to anyone.,Very_Bad
i have had this phone for two months...i loved it up until now.....the front keyboard stopped working and the phone would shut off every time i went to use it.When I flipped it to use the qwerty keyboard it would go back to the main screen.I have tried to contact amazon to see if anything can be done but I haven't heard back and it's been a week.I have to take the battery out and put it back in and I can make one call before it stops working.The time still continues to work so it must not be the battery.,Very_Bad

I ordered and paid for brand NEW Blackberry Storm 9530. I was supplied a re-manufactured phone which began giving problems within days of first use. OEM representative wanted to know how I knew it was a re-manufactured phone. It was clearly stated inside the back of the phone.While happy that they refunded me for cost of phone I am deeply distress that they deducted $5.00 for not returning it in the original package. Now what the hell are they needing original package for this piece of junk.

All the NEW g4 play phones on youtube came with a wall charger, a headset, and a usb charger. My amazon phone, advertised as NEW, had only the wall charger. Very suspicious - it might be an expensive refurbished moto g4 play phone and not a NEW phone.

Tried wiping it clean and starting over but that didn't work either. I've searched message boards and some other people have the same problem but no solution.I don't recall seeing the ""No Warranty"" language when I made the purchase in October 2014. Seller said there is no One Year Warranty with this phone.This is not a review of the type of phone in general. It worked fine in the first few months. Just make sure you buy it from Google directly so that it will come with a warranty.11/11/15 Follow Up: I replaced the battery and that fixed the malfunction problem. The original battery had swelled up like it was about to burst. But now, it will not work as a phone due to our TMobile network switching to 4G. If you are in the US and have 4G coverage, buy a D820 version, not this D821.",Very_Bad

"I don't know if it's just mine, but it has problems with over heating. Then there's the issue of the phone rebooting when I use Google Maps. As well as drops signal constantly. My Husban has the studio 6.0 hd lte and doesn't have any of these issues. That one while larger in size may be a better option. I've only owned this for 2 months!",Very_Bad

The phone is too slow and it was misinformation about the processes and the memory space. Overall it has very poor performance and I would not recommend this phone to anyone. If I could get a refund on this useless phone I would.,Very_Bad
The phone was NOT new as it said. It would not let me text and when I called verizon they said that the phone had been shocked and someone had tried to put the verizon system back on it and they did it wrong. So the phone can not be fixed. $110 WASTED!!!!!!!!,Very_Bad
The phone made me sound muffled & under water. I also could not hear well and had to use speaker phone.,Very_Bad

"These phones are European and do not work well with U.S. systems. Many of the features do not function, and for the life of me I can't figure out why the sample photo's, screen saver, backgound include pictures of David Beckum and one of a BMW automobile, that you can not delete. I lost my phone and wanted to replace it without having to get one of the newer phones that are data based and would altimately cost me more money per month. The only reason I do not consider it a complete waste is that I can make a phone call. (that's about it, though) Cheese-and-crackers this is a rip-off if I ever saw one.",Very_Bad
"First off, if I could give this negative stars I would in a heart beat. The phone is a total piece of crap and is most definitely refurbished, it is NOT new. The lights on the keyboard barely worked, the screen was extremely pixelated and was also very slow, like it was lagging. I've had the same phone when they first came out years ago so I know how it is supposed to look, I just wanted to give this as a gift to my grandmother and she couldn't even use it. The camera did not work either. Customer service took a MONTH to reply to me and I had to contact amazon to report this. They were not even cooperative with Amazon and I'm not sure why this product is still listed. You work hard for your money so please take my word for it and don't waste it on this junk.",Very_Bad
It's a ice of crap and I would like to know how to return for refund asap,Very_Bad
"Parece raro que este telÌ©fono gÌ©minis no trae espaÌ±ol en las opciones de cambio de lenguaje, mas que raro insÌ_lito, porque estos telÌ©fonos son multilenguaje, pareciera un telÌ©fono reconstruido, o usado previamente, y que le fueron eliminados los lenguajes para hacer mas espacio en la memoria de este smartphone, NO satisfecho con la compra.

"Phone wouldn't work 10 minutes after I got it. I've only had it for 5 hours. When I first turned it on, it took forever and I noticed these lines going across the screen. At first it would go black if I was on it for more than 30 seconds now the screen keeps fading black everytime I try to unlock it and will randomely shut off. Seems to me like water damage because this is what happened to my last iphone I got wet. So in that case this is a scam.",Very_Bad
"the phone is not new, i got a used phone and on top of that the screen has been replaced, i guess by looking at the entire edge of the screen and see glue all around it. the crystal that protects the back camera has scratches. not even my one year old g3 is this bad. really the crapiest ""new phone"" i have ever got.",Very_Bad

"Do Not Buy This Phone!!!Before purchasing this LG G4 H815 phone, please check the model number/manufacture date. If it was manufactured before September 2015, like mine was you will run into a lot of problems with the item. The models manufactured before September 2015 were recalled due to having several manufacturers defects. I experienced the split screen, where half of the screen becomes unusable with static like lines that you used to see when a tv station was signed off at the end of the night. It is very frustrating. I am in the process of sorting this situation out with Amazon, as the fault is not mine. They sold a defective phone!",Very_Bad
"Very stupidly configured--when you are on a call the screen keeps locking itself at one second intervals and there is no way to reconfigure this feature. If you need to keep using the dial pad on a call good luck--you will be punching the ""unlock screen"" key about ten thousand times during a five minute call. Also, no matter how carefully you put this phone in a pocket (after making sure it is OFF) it will open itself up and start taking pictures or trying to send an email or trying to access the web. I got rid of an earlier phone for these same reasons--I guess unless you buy the barest of bare-bones phones they will be a nightmare and a nuisance for someone who simply wants to make and receive calls.",Very_Bad
"The phone looked in great shape when I received it...however at first I noticed it was a bit slower than my previous iPhones. After a couple weeks it was very evident the phone was not processing well. Here we are 2 months later and besides using it as a phone, everything else is so slow that I cant browse or check email unless I have 15 minutes to wait and reopen the application multiple times. I am very disappointed in this product",Very_Bad
"Is the worst purchase I have made, the phone will not turn on, The phone comes internally burned, its a phone repowered. and now because of this I do not buy more phones on AMAZON",Very_Bad

I thought at least I would have wifi, but no. It could not connect with the wifi in the airport. It did for about an hour connect with the wifi in my hotel, but when I tried to download the skype app to make calls it began crashing. It turned out to be a really expensive alarm clock and it was too bad too, it looked like a nice phone and the display was nice and seemed easy to use unfortunately nothing worked. I returned to amazon and they refunded, of course that did not help me in France.",Very_Bad

"Phone seemed great but only after about a month it developed green lines running across the screen. After research these lines seem like a very common hardware fault rendering this phone (and the Droid Turbo 2) an awful purchase. Motorola might claim that it is due to user error, but when a hardware problem is this widespread it is clearly a design fault(I can find the exact same green lines in the exact same place from many many others). For the past 5 years I have been a loyal Motorola customer but this experience has soured me to the whole brand. Do not buy.",Very_Bad

I have had this phone for 3 days and my screen doesn't always work, having to click on everything multiple times isn't very exciting especially when you are trying to answer a really important call.

"I bought this phone as ""NEW"" ... Was not a new phone ... If you want this phone buy it from another seller ... When I opened the box the phone was in a Sony Ericson box for a flip phone .. I love this phone and expected a NEW (not used or refurbished one) phone ...Now to the problem:#1 I love the phone but the problem is when I use it everything works except when on the internet .. It will connect and stay online for 10 seconds to a minute (longer it you don't try to navigate past the Home screen of the page your looking at) then the phone powers down and back up without warning ...#2 The screen blacks out if the outside temp. is over 75 degrees and without warning and to reset that you have to remove the battery for a secondOverall the phone was CRAP unless that's all you wanted it for was to place a call (like a home phone or cell from the 80's) SO I can not stress the FACT anymore .. Buy it from someone not selling you JUNK like these guys",Very_Bad
"Update: Motorola is willing to honor warranty and repair phone at no charge based on proof of purchase date.First, the phone did not come with the car charger as advertised. Since it was a replacement phone, I didn't worry about it. The booklet and warrenty information that is in the box with all new phones was missing. Also not a big deal as I was relacing the same type of phone. Now, after 89 days, the phone screen has turned to a gazillion speckles. All attempts to 'reset' the phone have failed.So, if you have $250 to spend on a phone every 90 days, this is the phone for you.Amazon stated their 30 return policy and told me to contact the manufacturer for warrenty. It would be great if I had the warrenty information which was missing fron the box. I am left without a phone, unable to purchase another, no warrenty information, and relying on the charity of Motorola to hopefully make this right...if indeed it is really a NEW phone.",Very_Bad

I brought this phone looking a a good mix of features and price but it turned out worthless. First of all the seller sent a refurbished item and never responded to my Query. It worked for a month or so and then the volume rocker started to malfunction and volume up stopped functioning.

"I purchased this phone for the young daughter of good friends of mine who do not live in the US. Enjoying the amazon.com excellent service and customer service throughout the years, I sent the product to my friends the exact way it was received from amazon.com.Upon receipt of product at the country of destination, it became evident that the product was not new and the it was a T-Mobile LOCKED phone and not an HTC Unlocked Android Phone in a factory sealed box.Imagine the disappointment of a 9 year old girl receiving a REFURBISHED, LOCKED brick which cannot be used with a local SIM card.Due to the costs of shipping and the duties paid at the country of origin, returning this phone to the USA for it to be returned to amazon.com, makes no sense. This phone ended up as a paper weight.Very disappointed with amazon.com false advertising. Very untypical for amazon.com to mislead it's customers like that.",Very_Bad
"Not worth the money, it worked for about 4 months before completely failing. Overheats if you look at it wrong. Touch screen is very sluggish, phone does not do well with multitasking at all. Sound is good and battery was sufficient but not worth the price you pay.",Very_Bad
Here is my issue with this product and I have some of the blame to take here as well. I am writing this some 6 months or more after the purchase but the phone has never really acted right. Things I assumed was my service area is clear to me now that I have another phone that it was indeed the phone. I dropped calls from everywhere or simply never got them in the first place. The digitizer has started to de-laminate from the screen and has caused touch sensitivity problems. This phone was refurbished but in my opinion was poorly done and not properly tested. I really think I should be entitled to a refund but with only a 90 day warranty on the phone so much for that. Thoroughly disappointed.,Very_Bad

This is not a phone to take a quick picture, one would have to hold the phone steady for about 60 seconds to get a decent shoot. I wanted to return it, but my 30 day return time ran out, so I am stuck with it. One more thing it was a friend of mind who bought the 6 inch version that does no longer charges, my friend has to take out the battery to charge....that will be the last time I take advice from a friend on buying a phone. The only good thing for me is that the phone came unlocked and with a clear soft case. Don't buy this phone.",Very_Bad

"I needed an unlocked sim card phone for a trip to Costa Rica. I read the reviews both positive and negative and decided for short term to just text, call and email this phone would be OK. It wasn't OK. Not even close to OK. In addition to all the other negatives from other reviews I will add that the antenna on this phone is REALLY REALLY weak. I never could make a phone call because at best I had 1 bar and the call didn't go through. I never managed to get a text through but I did get the email to work. Unfortunately, I could only send emails if I was sitting within 5 feet of the router. Oh yeah, there is the battery life. There isn't any. OK, I'm exaggerating. If you don't use it, it has a day or two. If you forget to turn off Wi Fi you've got a couple hours.",Very_Bad

"I purchased this iPhone because the seller said it was unlocked. Once I received it I found out it was not unlocked. I reached out to Hillside Deals twice to see what they could do about this problem. I was hoping they would still be able to unlock the phone. I did not receive any response from the seller.Amazon worked very quickly in refunding the money I paid but my issue is not completely solved because I am still without an unlocked iPhone. I live in Haiti so the process of finding, purchasing, shipping and receiving is very long. Now I have to do it all over again. Thank you Amazon for your help but I will not be purchasing anything through Hillside Deals again.",Very_Bad

"Purchase a phone a month ago. The phone worked great. Even better than the Samsung I used before it. However, the screen is extremely fragile. One drop and the screen shattered, knocked off a table.

Second phone, ordered at the same time, the screen just shattered from a Febreeze spray bottle getting tipped over on it. NOT dropped on it but just tipped over and hitting the screen.

"The directions for inserting the SIM card were unclear. Subsequently I damaged the phone trying to insert the SIM card. The distributor suggested that I should get in touch with the manufacturer. However, because it is an international phone, Samsung US will have nothing to do with it. They first directed me to Samsung Canada. But Samsung Canada also wants nothing to do with it. If I type my model number into Google, I come up with Samsung UK. I am still trying to connect with Samsung UK. All that I would like is to get a phone that works. I am willing to pay for service, as it was, no doubt, my fault. Maybe Amazon can help?",Very_Bad

"I was using an iPhone 6, but it was lost to the water. This looked like a good option until the new iPhone 7's are released. Unfortunately, the performance difference is significant between this phone and an iPhone 6. The battery is really weak and normally requires charging before the day is over. The phone is super slow - The camera is slow to open; apps are terrible. Not sure if it is the IOS 9 on a iPhone 4 or the phone is bad, but this thing is much slower than the iPhone 4 I had years ago. Overall, the phone is very frustrating to use!",Very_Bad

I have adjusted touch calibration and it doesn't help. If I touch a 6 I get a 3 or a 9. It's all messed up and I will now have to buy another phone. Don't buy this one!",Very_Bad

"Saludos, soy de Venezuela y adquiri este celular (Blackberry Pearl 8110, fisicamente el celular estaba en buenas condiciones al llegar a mi pais, pero cuando fui a la empresa movistar que es el operador de mi servicio de telefonia celular para ponerle la linea y plan blackberry me dijeron que el celular no estaba liberado y por ende no me podian colocar el plan, ademas determinaron que el celular no funcionaba correctamente porque no mostraba algunos iconos en el menu como el del navegador y sin embargo me activaron el plan blackberry y cuando mandaba una solicitud del blackberry messenger a travez del celular, dicha solicitud nunca era enviada, asi que el veredicto final que me dio la empresa Movistar era que utilizara el celular como pisa papel que era la unica funcion que le podia dar, asi que la calificacion que le doy al vendedor es una estrella y eso porque no puedo dar menos de eso.",Very_Bad

"This is my first android phone. It was a little slow out of the box, even after I factory reset it. You have to turn off a lot of widgets and icons just to make it run decently.I do like the size of the phone. The screen is nice and super clear. Battery life isn't great, which seems to be common with androids. I usually can't make it through one full day without the battery dying.But it beats spending hundreds of bucks on a new iphone.EDIT: This phone is terrible. My friend who works at Verizon saw me using it and said, ""That phone is the worst phone ever, and I used to sell them."" Text notifications will randomly not sound, for no apparent reason. Texting will suddenly not allow you to input any letters. The phone will sometimes not respond when trying to make a call (although it will still do everything else), and then five to ten minutes later will finally start dialing (the WORST). What garbage.Good looking screen though.",Very_Bad
The phone could not connect to Verizon because antenna was broken in the phone.defective phone.I now have to return the phone.,Very_Bad
