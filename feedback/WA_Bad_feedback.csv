"Does not work with AT&T US sim cards. The two-sim setup must be for SIM cards in other countries, because it is not the standard US size--the SIM size is too small.",Bad
"The phone itself is fine the only problem is that its the wrong one. They will send you the g903f this model does not work with at&t LTE bands so no LTE for you all you'll get is hspa+. Second is that this is a single sim phone that will work in the UK, Italy, and most other European countries, but not in the US if you want LTE.",Bad
"I was very optimistic, im an Android lover. So I decided to get my first Sony Android Smartphone and im highly disappointed. The mic was faulty and did not work, Im not sure if it was hardware or a software problem. When someone called me they couldn't hear me at all, so it made the phone quite useless. I tried to love the phone, the build material is great and feels good in the hands. The waterproof design is a huge bonus the Sony UI is also simple and clean but quite buggy at times. This tends to be a problem with Sony their smartphones always have something minor or major wrong with them.",Bad
"I have had this phone almost one year in about two weeks. I wrote a review on Alcatel's website. To my dismay when I checked back on the review I wrote and how may stars I gave it, had been altered. The stars had been bump up from two to four stars and what I wrote edited by shortening the bad part of the review. I was absolutely disgusted. The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone. The phone came with Lollipop 5.0. They do not respond when asked by customers regarding updates to the phone. Not on their website, Facebook or speaking to them. Speak to them on updates and they have no answer for you. Because of that I will never buy this phone again.",Bad
after only a month I am having technical problems with it... i cannot send or receive mms (no photos at all) very disappointed,Bad
The phone has a problem. The glass at the screen is loose and now it has the dirt behind the glass.,Bad
DIDN'T LAST LONG ATE BATTERIES . REPLACED AFTER JUST A FEW WEEKS . NOT WORTH THE MONEY THAT IT COST,Bad
I bought this case 4 months ago and the piece that covers the ear phone and the piece that covers the usb cord have broken off. I have never had an issue with any other case. I was so excited and now I'm just disappointed. I expected much more.,Bad
"I bought this phone for my wife. Everything works good except the mic. She can receive calls and hear the other person, but they cannot hear her.",Bad
"I connect the charger to complete the loading of the phone but the phone does not charge when connected, I also tried the usb connected to the computer but does not recognize my phone",Bad
I enjoyed the phone for three days while it was working. Now the speaker work sometimes and other time not. The phone doesn't ring and no audio when music is played. How do I get the replacement quick?,Bad
"You'd think that as an Apple refurbished product, that they'd check the battery. When I received the phone and charged it I found the battery unable to hold the charge. After two frustrating weeks of hoping that the battery would improve, I gave up. I ordered a battery replacement kit. When I pulled out the old battery it had a four-year-old date stamp on it. So much for a refurbished phone. I guess all they (Apple) did was to wipe the screen and box it. What a cheap company.",Bad
"Phone didn't work as expected - bad battery, I assume. Customer Service, once I was able to reach them, provided options and provided a quick refund when the unit was returned.",Bad
Item was refurbished part of the front piece that covers the mouse area or control bottons came off within a week. When i sinchronized the phone with the card it had a girls name on the previous sinc someone I never heard of that's how I new this was not new.,Bad
I ordered a new cell phone and when it arrived it seemed it was put together in pieces. The back battery cover is sprained and the flip hinge shows signs of rust and makes a noise. In addition the body is scratched with one chip on the front casing. The plastic battery bag was unsealed.,Bad
"This phone is the second one I have bought of this type. The first one started turning off on a whim early on, even in the middle of calls. I returned it and replaced it with another one. This one worked for about four months then the same thing started happening . This morning it turned off while I was trying to answer a call from a prospective employer..",Bad
There's a few apps it will not let you download due to being a blackberry. It is a little hard to get used to.,Bad
the charger was no good it was heating up and the battery doesn't last longI had a few scratches on it and need it a microchip for pictures not enough internal memory,Bad
"This watch did ok, the alarm that would go off when you left you phone just never worked right I feel, and it had some powder inside the would gather on the face when static would build up, like taking off your coat. I guess it was like only $25.00 but I am sorry if you are going to sell something cheap or not at least make it work.",Bad
I will not buy this unit anymore. Audio is so low that i need to use the speaker phone everytime i make calls and received incoming calls. It's so annoying especially i am in public places.,Bad
"The Iphone has scratches, scuffs on the sides, a lot of dust and dirt. In addition, the charger, cable box and headphones are not the originals. I am disgusted with purchase!!!",Bad
I got this phone for my pre-teen kid.It worked well and held a charge for a very long time.Then she sat on it and it broke.Yeah... < $20 for the phone... but it lasted a month.Not recommended.,Bad
I really like the phone but hate that I can't get or send MMS messages with it. I wish I could return it and am going to try to sell it.,Bad
Still problems with the phone that I have to get fixed but for the most part it was a good upgrade,Bad
Phone overheats very easily. After purchasing I saw reviews that this is a problem with the phone. After having it for a few months it started freezing. I wish I could return it.,Bad
"I did not like this product a lot because I had no descriptions Rhodesia that the product was repaired, only used desia or pictures you could see the scratches had hope they can resolve that.",Bad
"This was a hassle. I purchased the phone and the one I was sent was a piece of crap. Then I was offered to have a replacement. It is an ok phone. It definitely isn't what I was hoping for as a replacement of my old phone. Both phones had been damaged by water. The first phone I received was a waste of my time. The phone I was wanting to replace with it was in better shape. The second one works, but the battery is crappy and it doesn't always fully charge when I plug it in. The only good thing about this transaction was the shipping. It was fast and arrived before it said that it was going to. I would never buy from this seller again.",Bad
"i BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN JANUARY, AS DID 3 OF MY FRIENDS , HERE IT IS IN AUGUST AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS STILL FUNCTIONING. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",Bad
"Looks good, but doesn't function as advertised. Six days in and the fingerprint reader is awful (more trouble than security). The ""gorilla"" glass broke while the phone was in the case in my pocket, and no, I wasn't rock climbing. It's not a bad deal for 150 with the accessories, but I wish I had put the money into something more durable.",Bad
"I got the C905A AT&T locked phone. (I will get AT&T to unlock this phone in two years when its contract is up.)The phone and camera is fun.The instructions are deplorable. Someone fired any talent they might have had in the instruction manual department for sure! Maybe this is a result of meddling by ""the NEW AT&T"", I dont know but someone made an unholy mess of the owner's manual. Undefined terms, sloppy wording that is inaccurate, features not mentioned and other features with major subfeatures missing. For example there is no mention of MP3 anywhere in the manual and yet you can load songs with ease and the phone will play them. Instructions for operation of the volume control is wrong. Reference to ""hands free"" which term they dont bother to define: ""plug in the hands free"" to make an antenna for the FM.For the big money they ask for this phone I am disappointed.",Bad
"It's just like any other Android. But blu messed up on this phone. Mostly everyone I know is right handed, most of the world is right handed but, the volume and power control is on the left side. Why? the button to clear all apps has been moved to the top of the screen. why?This was my 3rd phone from Blu but after this I will never purchase another phone from you. You have disappointed me.",Bad
"In an emergency I tried to call 911. Yes I was nervous and probably not touching the touch screen just the way I was supposed to, but I need a phone that can handle moments like that. This phone was not for me.",Bad
"This makes phone calls and sends texts and the internet is alright, but it can barely get any apps that iPhones or androids can get, my camera does not work and right before I wrote this, it froze for over an hour and a half.",Bad
"Bought this since I couldn't find any shatter-proof, waterproof phones from the US. Phone came in Russian and is apparently made in Korea. Who cares, right? Apparently they have very different standards for usability and user experience.Turning it face-down will silence your alarms. Guess you get to sleep with it lighting up whenever some app sends you a notification. Great.Volume buttons work when the phone is locked and the screen is off. Why? I NEVER find the sound profile on the one I last set it on, not to mention the options don't really take effect. Same stupid default ringtone plays even though I have it on another one.As a comparison, I had a cheapo pre-paid Android from Wal-Mart for a third of the price, and it's far better-designed.",Bad
Great phone easy to use. The phone was not new as stated in the add that's why it gets 2 stars. There was video of someone along with three pictures that I deleted from the phone.,Bad
"it was decent but it didnt really impress me, the keyboard is hard to type on plus too small plus the other features was just average.",Bad
I have doubts it's a new phone. The charger is Sony Ericsson which is really strange.I will see if I keep it or return it. I dont like when someone cheats in this cheap way.,Bad
The phone was grossly over priced. I found the same phone for $39.95. The phone itself was okay but not for$69.00.,Bad
since i bought this item it opened once has not been able to use it its an ornament.,Bad
"We ordered 3 of these Rugby II's for myself, my wife, and my son. The microphone quality on these phones suck. lot of people can't understand what I or my wife are saying, my son agrees and hates the USB's inability to leave the ph on when plugged in.All of these phones shut down when you plug into the Mico-USB port.WE had motorola v3 razr's which were all-round much better phones even at 5+ years old! These Samsungs are a nuisance to set up and operate.I sent all 3 phones back for refund. It took some time to sort it out but I have been notified by Amazon that all refunds have been issued.",Bad
"Ok my first Xperia bought directly from Sony was the z2 and the lte didn't work no biggie I just brought it to the att store to register it and lte workdd fine now for thid one its lte doesn't work apparently this pbone im using was previously used on someone else's network which ""completely disabled the lte"" att support. I have till the 12 of September to return it if the phone becomes available at best buy or something like that where I know its brand new I will dp that however I am confused on what I've read on the Internet about thid phone nkt showing lte connection but hey cant always trustthe Internet",Bad
"I switched from lumia 521 to this phone. Things that I missed are: 1) double tap to wake up the phone, 2) built-in call block feature, 3) longer battery life.This phone has a lot of Google bloat ware that cannot be uninstalled. It's taking up a lot of memory space. The phone gets very warm during prolonged use and charging.The most disappointing things are battery life and no call block feature. I have to install an app that adds to depleting the battery.In conclusion, this higher priced phone did not perform as well as my old lowest end lumia Windows phone. It is disappointing and way below my expectation.",Bad
"I purchased two pads. Both work intermittently and require precise positioning of your phone. My phones (Samsung 7S) flash and beep several times whenever I place them onto the pad. The charging pad will, when it works, charge my phone overnight. The USB charger takes about an hour. This purchase was a mistake and I cannot recommend this product.",Bad
Great phone but the mobile data never worked once I activated it. Apparently this happens allot with unlocked phones and neither HTC nor my carrier could help me. Had to return it.,Bad
"Normally I like blu phones but after using this one, I dont think I will be purchasing another. This thing spends more time frozen than it does functioning. And what's worse is that most of the time the only way to get it unfrozen is to pull the battery, and even then it starts up frozen again on occasion. And I have factory reset it 2-3 times, and I've had it freeze immediately afterwards with nothing but stock apps. This phone is complete garbage. There is no other way to put it",Bad
"Received phone DOA. Such great specs, so bad QC. On searching noticed other are complaining about same where phone does not turn on and does not charge. Petty, I really like the specs of this phone. I will wait a little longer before giving another go.",Bad
"I bought it for my mother,, the language options for set up the phone are only english and a lot of arabic, korean or indian idiograms that I do not understandbut not spanish, I asked about it to the seller and the answer was that I should go to any technician to get the spanish language set up (solve by myself), so until today she could not use the phone. As I had to return from US to my country I could not return it to the seller otherwise I would have done it.",Bad
"In January, I purchased 2 phones one for my husband and one for me. One came in a sealed package the other came in an open one with the return bill of a previous buyer and his restaurant bill, too. I should have figured out it was returned because it was damaged. At Wireless Experts Inc.(the seller), they swore the phone was fine, but it is not. Based on my doubts about having it being returned they reimbursed $100 out of the $400 I paid. Anyway, do not buy from them! My phone does not work well. It gets static in one position, does not charge well, the starting screen shows the time and weather in Atlanta when I do not live in the States. Finally, my being an international customer makes it difficult time and money wise to claim for my customer rights.",Bad
When charging the battery the screen had waves of interference to the point I would not use the tablet while charging. I returned the tablet.,Bad
"This phones works fine the first 2 months, after that the white cover turns yellow with the sun or any kind of dirt and dust, I would not recommend it",Bad
"When i bought this phone, the review noticed it was a brand new phone. But i find out it was used and it has been refurneshed.",Bad
"I had sooo much trouble with call quality, that I had to return the phone. Keep in mind, I am in a large US urban area, where reception is great. This was a replacement phone while my big smartphone was sent in for repair. Really disappointed.",Bad
"Although I pressed the ""new"" button when I made the order for purchase. I still in fact recieved a refurbished unit. I don't believe this phone will last a full year. But for the price and not haveing to be at the mercy of the phone company with a contract. Since coming out of contract, I have not had one billing issue. When I was under contract, every month there was an issue. I had to take the time to call. not having that hassle is well worth the price if I have to buy three every two years.",Bad
"Hello, I get my phone, unfortunatelly I can't send SMS or use internet. The only 2 things I can do with it are: send and receive calls and receive sms. I love this phone but I will need your help to solve this problem because it does'nt work. Looking forward to your comments.Thank you,Best",Bad
I knew I was buying a used phone but I wasn't expecting there to be text messages on it still...,Bad
"I has the same new phone 3 years ago. this phone has diff box, not org battery. and its sofeware is not stable. it always start a app by itself.",Bad
"If you are looking for a 4G phone, this is not for you. Also this phone had a very low reception.",Bad
Expensive but cheaper than buying a new phone. Have dropped my phone several times without problems so it must work. The only issue I have had is that the screen cover seems to be able to get dirty often and doesn't wipe as clean or clear as I would like. Overall a good product.Update from my last review. The otter box if falling apart and I have had it less than a year. The rubber rim is peeling off so pretty sure it's not water resistent anymore. Seems less durable and makes me fear my phone will break if I drop it instead of being a protective case.,Bad
"Battery doesn't last a day. I even spent $40 dollars replacing the batteyr hoping that was the problem, but the new one doesn't last a day either. I am going back to the non-touch version, it isn't worth it.",Bad
Its ok not for every showing good to use at or a starter watch for a name brand one....its good for what you pay for,Bad
"Phone part works well. But I cannot use the internet because the browser is constantly crashing. I can make it about 30 seconds when the message pops up ""Your browser has unexpectedly crashed."" This happens no matter how many times I try to restore. It happens on both the ATT network, and my home network.",Bad
"The phone charging unit seems to have a short as it dont charge you constantly have to be checking the phone to see if it is. The option to cancel the seller not available no more.This was a bad purchase from get go, shipping was late and now phone dont work properly,",Bad
Great phone. But lack of updates makes it a phone brand I won't buy again!! Samsung is better.,Bad
Don't ever drop it. It wont work anymore. I had my other phone for 5 years and just decided it was time for a new one and I got the new phone in mail accidently dropped it my 2nd day of having it and been out of a phone every since,Bad
"Sadly the 4g Doesnt work with ATT Network, if you are in the United States don't buy this phone.",Bad
"I got this phone in January and after a week of having it it started turning off by itself all the time, it started freezing, over heating, randomly closing out of texts and web pages when i am in the middle of doing something, and 2 weeks ago the camera stopped working completely. It is very frustrating to the point where i want to throw this phone sometimes. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE OFF AMAZON. I think it is time for me to get an iPhone.",Bad
"verykool s5017 Dorado 4G HSPA+ 5.0"" IPS LCD...the battery lasts about 2 or 3 hours. I sent an email to the company about a month ago with no response. And the user manual doesn't help much. I do regret buying this phone. I wish I could send it back.",Bad
"As a lover of Google Nexus phones, I regret that I have to rate this phone so poorly.I have had the S, the 3, and the 5 and I bought the 5X and the 6P last Christmas. The problem with this phone is the plastic material that it is made with. It feels light and cheap especially when compared to the Nexus 6P or the Nexus 5. It functions very much like the Nexus 5 but with a better camera and the figure print scanner. I bought the 5X as a Christmas gift for my wife and shortly afterwards it started having issues. The WiFi stopped connecting and then it stopped recognizing sim cards. The first time that it happened, it started back working after it was rebooted. A few weeks later it stopped recognizing sim cards again and even though we tried different sim cards and rebooted it several times, it did not work. I even did a factory reset. I finally returned it. I would advise anyone to spend the extra money and get the Nexus 6P. I really expected better from LG.",Bad
"The phone works. The phone has glitches, like the home key doesn't always work and is unresponsive. There are times when you're trying to make a call and the phone doesn't respond.",Bad
"I am totally not happy with this IPHONE. I requested unlocked Iphone, however what I got is locked one, therefore I don't like it.",Bad
Returned the item becuase it run to hot in just a few minutes of use even while charging with phone power off,Bad
At times the phone goes blank the the HTC page pulls up then it says reloading. Acts like it wants to get stuck as well.,Bad
"I ordered 9220,and I was trying to activate my BBM,but I can't. So Icalled Blackberry Customer support,and told me,that the ""pin"" that I have does not exist! The rep asked me if it has warranty,and it doesn't. So the rep was somehow telling me it's not legit enough. I'm returning it for a full refund,and get the same phone with warranty. Goodluck for me!",Bad
I got this for my wife. Phone seemed great at first then began to bog down quickly. Phone appears to have 4.8gb of storage (Not the advertised 8gb) 3+ of which is taken up by the Android OS. Feel like I got bait and switch.,Bad
"It was locked. What a shame. Had to return it the same day because it was not an unlocked phone. Also, there were two pictures previously in the phone. It looked like whoever was packaging the phone decided to take some pictures first. Took one of a black guy working across from him and another afar off using the zoom. And, the headphones that it came with looked like cheap headphones. Pretty sure that worker pocketed the good ones and put those cheap ones in there.",Bad
"I've had this phone for 44 days. It continually crashes and has to be re-booted. As of last night it will no longer turn back on. Amazon doesn't offer any assistance after 30 days. I've contacted LG about exchanging it for a working phone, but this is the 2nd LG phone that has done this to me. I am a fan of LG products, but this phone is a disappointment.",Bad
Speakers don't work. None of the pre-installed navigation apps work. They all force close once opened.,Bad
"I can't set my songs as my ringtone, all it allows you to use is the crappy phone ring tones that came with it.",Bad
"I recently bought this phone and it is beautiful, the camera takes clean pictures and stuff but i'm so disappointed because the phone is out dated and i've been trying to update it but so far no luck. In the settings I required to open a nokia account and i've been trying to do so with no luck, it also does not support google play...",Bad
This phone does not live up to how it is promoted. My husband has a cheapLG that will run on 3G and this phone is advertised for 4G but wouldn't evenrun at 2G. The Seller was very easy to work with and I would not hesitate tobuy from them again. They sent me an email to see if I was satisfied withthe product and did not hesitate to give me a full refund when I asked for it.,Bad
Does not work well at all. Can't make or receive calls or text at times... It has a delay.. Very slow very very slow...Don't buy this phone,Bad
"I would not recommend this product to those looking for a cheaper unlocked smartphone. It has barely lasted three months and we've already sent it in for repairs and its looking like we're going to have to send it in again because the micro-usb port is flakey.With other similarly priced or slightly more expensive options that are unlocked from larger players and are far superior devices, I can't justify the $200+ cost of this phone.",Bad
"Bought it new, used with care, but after only 2 months it went on the fritz. Would no longer accept a charge. Too late to return it to Amazon, and shipping charges plus Dell repair costs would come to more than what I paid for the phone.",Bad
"Phone didn't work right at first; not readable also words were upside down, strange stuff. Then several days later started working okay and could see and read the front dial. I almost sent it back, then decided to see if it kept working okay, still seems to be working. J. N.",Bad
Couldn't find the correct sim card to fit in the phone. I tried 3 different sim cards and I had a hard time getting the sim cards out once put in the phone because they were all too small. Once the card goes in you can't get it out unless you remove back of the phone. The more you try to get it out the further it goes down in the slot.,Bad
Item looks and feels fake....get from known carrier! The original has no logo on the top right corner this one does....like most knock offs do....be smart and buy it form a local retailer,Bad
"Everything is just fine, but I hate the UI and Android is only 4.2.1. One thing that really annoys me is that they make the background image blurry.",Bad
"HTC certainly made a mess of the lay out and there's no way to fix it. It works and works well but omg the UI. The phone is to small but that's my fault, I was trying to save a few dollars and should have spent some more. Sends and Receives very good with Selectel mvno of Verizon the phone is clear.",Bad
"It's working fine but I didn't get the color I order, didn't like dat sorry",Bad
Didn't even remove it from the plastic wrap. This thing is a brick! It weighs a ton. Not going to deal with a phone that weighs as much as a battery brick recharger.,Bad
"The wireless connection disconnects constantly, and reconnect again.I'm using my old Galaxy S5 in the same home wireless network, and not getting this issue (it's obvious that the wireless antenna is not working fine on my new S6)",Bad
"I bought this last month, until then I had iPhone 5c. Although this phone claim to be powerful, but the reality is not. It can't handle any load, managing two simple applications is difficult for this phone. The quality of the mic is very poor. Most of the times, I have to repeat to others.One of greatest feature is the battery life. Extremely good battery. it runs for 2 days easily (for medium user).It has great looks and screen brightness is very good.But my worry is on the performance side. The custom OS makes this phone really bad performer.My iPhone 5c, although very old works great. Huwei should focus on improving performance and mic quality.",Bad
Ive had this phone from this seller for about 5 months now and when it arrived it looked like new.the screen was immaculate and there wasn't a scratch on it.the phone itself worked fast and performed flawlessly...for about 3 months.3 months into owning this refurbished phone it began to restart itself constantly.Now it restarts itself at least 20 times before i even get to the lock screen.it also glitches out whilee restarting itself.i have taken excellent care of this phone and am very dissatisfied with the product.My advice is to spend the extra $100-$200 dollars and buy new,Bad
Really enjoying the phone except that I was sent a phone without working flash.. still debating on sending it back,Bad
"This phone is perfect, however I dont think I received an original LG charger. It is a generic one, and it stopped working today after scarsely two months of use. Currently I am not in the US and finding the adequate charger is being very complicated. This should not happen.",Bad
VERY BAD PRODUCTNo point of buying this product I may look good but it's a andriod.have a very bad camera. You also can't call on this tab.,Bad
"For my niece, she wanted to have this ""phone?"". Well, it's cheap and you get what you pay for. Let's see how long it lasts.",Bad
After a year and multiple white screen it finally stop working and now no way to get it fixed. :(,Bad
"It was a good watch while it lasted. I accidentally got it a little wet and now it is frozen and won't let me do anything on it. Before it stopped working, I got it connected to my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone just fine and even answered a phone call. But now it keeps getting stuck on one screen and I never know when it will start working again. Needless to say it was kind of a disappointment.",Bad
Another victim of Xperia sudden death with no return to resusscitation in spite of trying al maneuvers including repair by Sony software FOR the third time in 6 months. The only remedial factor for me is the big screen and the design and solid feel overall.,Bad
"worked great for about 6 months, and then the battery died. I get about an hour of run time out of it now. probably go with something else, this is too expensive for a burner.",Bad
Just a basic phone nothing special. You get what you pay for; don't expect much for the price but great for calls only. Texting is difficult with the little keys.,Bad
Having some issues with the phone. Voice quality is getting poor after every 4 mins.,Bad
"I got this phone for my son. I didn't want to spend a lot of money since this was going to be his first phone. This phone is horrible. I wouldn't recommend it. It quite working after 5 months. It will not turn on, hold a charge or anything. The SD card got damaged, so he lost all of his videos and pictures(which he cried about for a while). If your doing to purchase this phone all I have to say is good luck.",Bad
"I experienced the same problem as other reviewers:1. The ear piece plug hole does not line up with the earplug jack on the iPhone 6... this must be a irregular unit2. The touch part of the iPhone has been rendered ineffective due to the thick nature of the front cover...3. the silence switch is near impossible to get to. For people who has larger hands, it will be impossibleThe box seems sturdy but adds a lot of weight.",Bad
"I love my phone, seriously, I wanted to ditch my iPhone but was a little nervous so decided to spend less money in case I decided to buy the new iPhone after all. IT'S AWESOME! The camera is not great, that's my only complaint, but it's slim and smooth and gorgeous and I absolutely adore it. The sound is really clear during phone calls and when I make audio recordings. IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE ENTER KEY, press the ""shift"" button on the keyboard, it will appear at the bottom right. Aloha :)UPDATE 10/12/15:The phone is no longer charging. I am really really gentle with this phone. I have found many other people who have had the same problem. It just won't charge. I'd like to CONTACT THE SELLER. Still looking for the link. This is so annoying. -.-",Bad
"The battery would die after a full charge in about 40hrs of just setting,blue tooth and locating gps off. Sellers need to test the battery life of these phones.",Bad
I like the phone except for texting. U hit one letter and the letter above it comes up! I've had other people try it and the same thing happens. It takes forever to get an accurate text! Otherwise I love everything else about it!,Bad

"I received the phones from the seller "" Open Group Wireless"" a few days ago and found out the seller intend to deceive the consumers by saying this phone is ""I8160bk"". There are three versions of this Galaxy Ace 2 cellphone: I8160, I8160P, I8160L.The actual product this seller sent out is the ""I8160L"" version, which is the ""Thailand"" version. This version can't be upgraded to Android system 4.1.2.I definitely don't recommend this seller ""Open Group Wireless"".",Bad
Product shipped on time and arrived as promised. It was brand new as advertised. BUT I ended up returning the product because the wifi would not work. Not sure who's fault this is. Googleing this problem I learnt that a lot (but clearly not all) S4 have this problem . I think it is a software problem but I was not able to resolve it using all the suggestions that I found on the android forums etc. I did everything from pulling the battery to doing a factory reset (actually did several of those). In the end I just could not spend any more time on this problem and returned it. The return process was painless and quick. I gave them a 2 because I think this was a software problem and the product might work fine for someone else with a different network/setup. BTW I am on ATT in US>,Bad
"Won't go to sleep so battery lasts a matter of hours. Any USB charger other than the one that was provided with the phone looks like it's charging, but actually drains the battery. Would not recommend buying this phone.",Bad
"Looking for a phone that I could activate on my current family plan without hassle from Verizon. Read carefully description and reviews. By the picture looked like a standard phone in regular box (not prepaid). Picture was not of a prepaid phone in it's package. From reading reviews on other phones that stated they were prepaid it's seems to be hit or miss if Verizon will let you activate immediately to a current plan. This phone did appear to be brand new and we actually received before expected. BUT, didn't want a prepaid! I feel the description and pic was misleading. I was able to return without hassle. Thanks Amazon, always easy to work with.",Bad
Purchase this phone within 3 weeks had to return it. call log stop work Paid $204.88 and all they want to return is $174.15 and they tell me nothing is wrong with the phone. I had to pay$31.33 also to ship it go back to them. Not Good Not Happy.,Bad
"I ordered this since it is mentioned Unlocked. I ordered this to use outside US. Unfortunately 3G is not supported there so I'm stuck with this phone only having EDGE. My recommendation is, if anyone intention to use this outside US please check that country 3G bands and make sure it is matching with the one mentioned in this phone. (4G HSPA+ up to 21Mbps 850/1700/1900) So I've no use this phone now and can't be returned also.",Bad
"Used 2 weeks and was discolored and looked dirty. I am a college student, so my phone is not exposed to any particularly ""dirty"" situations, therefore the discoloration should not have occurred in such a short time frame. Love the protection of the Otter Case though just would recommend a different color than the pink and white/gray...",Bad
"I normally don't write reviews but I figure since this one has pissed me off I might as well.I have had the phone about 8 months. It worked fine for the first few months. It isn't flashy. It isn't top of the line. It is a basic android phone with a decent screen and features. The camera isn't too good but it isn't crap either.For about the last month the phone has been randomly turning off on its own. I didn't know why it was happening but it would just turn off. The the other day it turned off on its own, and refused to turn back on. I did some Google searching and it seems that this is more of a common problem than I thought. It happens to these phones often. Anyways, I tried the ""suggested"" methods of bringing my phone back online without much luck. So I requested a RMA with an exchange. Since their warranty is very limited and only good for 90 days. I am hoping they fix my phone, or send me a new one. And since it just died without warning, I was unable to back-up any data.This is a major problem.",Bad
not very happy at all did not have the battery included seriously!!!! I will get back with a better review if they give me a battery!!,Bad
"The phone will not charge not battery not charger its the phone, this phone was suppose to be new, don't think so",Bad
"The product failed one week after I started to use. In addition, looks cheap and operating system is very old.",Bad
"I am somewhat disappointed with my purchase of this phone. I love the Motorola phone but with this Motorola Droid Maxx HD there are some things I find unacceptable. First of all the battery life is not good, every few hours I need to recharge and it's not like I have a ton of apps on my phone. Secondly the phone is always getting hot, to the point where I have to let it rest to cool down. Apart from these two issue I think the phone is good, love the storage space.",Bad
"Purchase this phone based on the seller's description stating it would work both for AT&T and TMobile. However, after I bought the phone (I've TMobile), it arrived imprinted with AT&T and would not connect to the internet. When I took it into TMobile, they advised this particular phone was not ever offered by them and that it was not setup to connect via the TMobile network. True to form, I then went to AT&T and asked them. They could not explain why the phone would not connect via either wifi or through my current data plan; however, the only place the phone connected was at the AT&T hotspot in the store.The phone itself was fine. Bigger and clunkier than I had hoped, as I currently use a BB Bold, but I honestly can't fault the phone, its delivery or its condition. I was able to quickly and painlessly return the phone which I greatly appreciated.",Bad
I loved the phone but 4G isn't supported in the US for this phone and that was a deal breaker for me. I even contacted Samsung Customer Support and they couldn't help with this either. Sad that I had to return it.,Bad
The phone freezes. You have to turn it off to infreeze it. This phone is cheaply made. This phone didnt come with a user manual,Bad
This phone is not very good. Keep in mind it's the OLD SCHOOL texting kind of set up where you have to scroll through the letters so if you text a little or a lot keep that in mind. Yes it's a basic phone but the sound is horrible when talking on it and I get no bars all the time. Even if you are looking for something basic I say spend a little more and go with a better phone,Bad
"There is a defect with the battery, the phone shuts off every now and then when I have plenty of battery as if my battery is empty.",Bad
"Comes ""unlocked"" but all T-Mobile features will not work with this device. If you're an AT&T customer...great. Nice phone without question. Item was returned with no problem. Use Prime! It's worth the cost.",Bad
These do not work with my service and I am not allowed to return them,Bad
First time using Windows phone and is a little complicated for me. I prefer Android system is easier. The phone is sealed and if the battery needs to be replaced I don't know how it works. No way to upgrade memory there is a slot only for SIM card. I been using Metro PCS and I never got problems with service and with this Lumina 900 the service is poor also to sending texts.,Bad
"Everything ok, it works fine in Argentina, but what about the position of letters ""z"" and ""y""?? As it's shown in the picture they are ""swap"" (I think this is the expresion). If I look for images of this phone in google, all of them have this letter in the opposite way. Well, just that surprise. Excelent phone.Seller must tell us it's a QWERTZ (Germany) keyboard insted of a QWERTY... AZERTY (France).",Bad
"The home button doesn't work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. A little disappointed",Bad
"Perhaps this is a personal prefer, but I don't care for my phone to take up as much space as a small aircraft carrier in my pocket. As I'm am not currently deployed in a war zone, I stopped using this for something slimmer.",Bad
When video is playing or an audio podcast if u turn the phone to landscape view or back to portrait view it will skip. By skip I mean it goes onto the next podcast. It does the same thing when I listen to Pandora radio I.e. Changes on it's own to the next song without my hitting the next advance button. I have tried shutting off the accelerometer but his has not helped at all. I a convinced this is one of the bad batches that HTC made. Or I at least had the impression HTC made good phones.,Bad
"I did buy the phone used. I've had too many problems to say I care about the phone. It might have been good a year after it came out, but not worth it now. I've had to replace numerous parts that have gone out on it. the internal storage is low and even if you have a large memory card, some apps are required to be stored on the phone. That's the main complaint of many.",Bad
I cannot get the bluetooth to connect to ANYTHING. It sees items but will not connect.,Bad
"I didn't know this was a go phone from att, if I known that, I hadn't buy it, is not what I expected.",Bad
It was great until I dropped my phone one time and the back part came off,Bad
"These things are super cool. They're cheap, they're android, and if you don't expect much you definitely won't be disappointed. So why then only 2*s? I've had to replace it once already because of dead pixels out of the box and here I am a week later with the replacement phone, dead pixels.It's not just one or two, it's a good chunk of the screen.",Bad
"It's an ok phone, the screen is poor in resolution, the cpu is kinda slow on times and the phone get's stuck on a black screen from time to time, i need to remove the battery because pressing power buttons or combinations of volume up and down dont work. My true rating is 2.5 stars not 2 and especially not 3. Another thing to consider, if you are going to use it for 2 sims it will get ever slower and slower until it reboots itself, so i dont recommend the 2 sim solution even if you are on a budget this a a semi-waste for a 2 sim long term solution, if it's for a short term AKA 3 to 6 month's then yeah take it for a spin, no harm done. This phone is for budget minded people only not a long term solution phone because it will give you trouble from time to time.",Bad
"The phone showed more wear than expected. One key wouldn't work when the phone was cold and the blue tooth capability died after a couple of months, so the phone is worthless to me.",Bad
"This phone seems to be of pour quality, toy like. Not RUGGED as discribed to me in fact I took it to a Sprint store to confirm it was ok. When turning it on it says Nextel on the screen. This is concerning to me because I don't think Sprint will be offering Nextel phones in the future. Check with Sprint before purchasing this phone. They also may charge you to return it.",Bad
"BUENAS TARDES YO COMPRE ESTE ARTICULO Y EN MI PAIS VENEZUELA NO FUNCIONA ESA TECNOLOGIA, NO CONSIGO COM HACER PARA UTILIZAR EL TELEFONO CELULAR, QUISIERA SABER SI ME PUEDEN AYUDAR",Bad
I feel tricked after getting the phone today. What I was told was not the same as when i got it. I am so disappointed. The charging area of the phone was broken and create problem with the charging in the future.,Bad
I chose this rating because the phone only worked well for less than one month. It completely quit texting after three weeks. I probably will never buy a cell phone through mail order again.,Bad
I don't like the baterry life is too short. the price is ok . And it take too many day ship,Bad
"Loved the phone. Had it for 4 months with no problems..... then one day it stopped charging. I purchased a new charger only to find out it was the actual charger port on the phone. So I tried to contact posh, which consisted of me googling the number for customer service.... Aha! No damn phone number. So I emailed them and requested a new phone. They approved my request and sent me a link to mail my old phone in and I would receive a new phone. So I have my pen and paper ready but I look and Aha Again! No shipping address so I'm screwed..... I will never order another item from Posh. I love Amazon and have been doing business with them for years and my only",Bad
"Ran really hot, crappy build quality, was AT&T Branded. I really wanted to love this phone, but it just had too many issues :(",Bad

"Hi,I don't like this product because the phone is not ok i faced many problems in this phone but the phone shipped on the time but seriously i am not satisfied .....!!!!",Bad
"The battery life was lower than expected. The red case chipped very easily especially at the side near the buttons. Call quality is reasonable. However the AT&T software isn't very efficient. There is a moment of pause after hitting the menu button for it to get to the menu. Also, there's no easy way to access voicemails. Thus I ordered and received a Nokia 106 to replace this phone. It hasn't even been a day but I am liking it better already.",Bad
The protective screen was scratch two different spots. I would like for you to send me a new one and I can send this one back. Other than that I like it. I didn't know how to send it back cause I threw away the paper work and package it came in. So if you could let me know what I need to do that would be great.Thank youDenise,Bad
First off the phone is smaller then you would think im talking the whole phone not the just the screen size. The keyboard buttons are very jammed tight. It freezes alot and it shuts off randomly. On phone calls its really easy to push buttons with you cheek because the screen does not like to stay blacked out. I understand its not a 3g phone but even for edge it runs slow for what in its time was a high end android. the battery life if only okay when other reviews will say its awesome well not really unless you do nothing on your phone but the basic text here and there and a couple phone calls a day. The phone says it comes with a memory card well it does not and the phone it self has little memory not even enough to hold the facebook app so look forward to spending at least another 15$ on a SD card. All in All this phone is not worth the price its being sold for.,Bad
"This is a good GSM CellPhone but some problems: The Signal receptor is terrible.. The battery is veryy bad.. This is a cheap phone. I prefer the Nokia 5230, only $45 more and go get gps.",Bad
it was late when I received it and I took it to have a service connected and the phone was not unlocke I was in a hurry so it took it to some one in town that charged me 50 bucks to have it done and then it worked. Phone was fine wasn't happy with the hassle of the time it took to get the phone and having to have it unlocked when it arrived.,Bad

"The Galaxy Note 2 is superb in most ways except one. In the battle between nerds and sales people, the nerds have truly won out. By a lot. In other words, it is not consumer-friendly for the average consumer. In setting it up, one is confronted with numerous compulsory choices that are unclear, ambiguous and risky. Though I spent over 4 hours studying the online manual, I now have a costly device where access to what I need is uncertain. And where simple operations on most smart phones seemingly are not available though I suppose they exist somewhere. In conclusion, if you have the knowledge to survive complexity and complications that produce unpredictable results, the Note 2 may be for you. I chose it over an Apple product because of its size and greater visibility -- more like a tablet. I am sorry I did.",Bad
"I like the software and the look, it ran perfectly. But the screen cracks very easily and a replacement for these guys is $300. Upon replacement, the proximity sensor stopped working which meant as soon as I made a call, the screen went black and I couldn't end the call (I would leave 10 minute long messages unless I manually turned the phone off).I've had this phone for about 3 or 4 months now and the screen has just started going haywire as well. The image content cycles across the screen like it's on a conveyor belt. I've spent $600 on this phone so far and I've been having chronic problems. For me, I regret making the purchase...",Bad
"We purchased this early Jan 2014. We had a lot of trouble getting it working. First of all the SIM card from the previous Atrix did not work in it. This has a small SIM card. They cut the SIM card with a special tool at phone company. So, you cannot go back the previous phone easily. We had a lot of trouble since we found out that the phone does not work after the SIM card was cut. It was a nightmare. We could not go back to previous phone. We had to go to two ATT stores to confirm the the phone was not working. We could not return the phone since the box was already tossed. Thus, we sent the phone to Motorola to get fixed. It took another 2-3 weeks to get it fixed. We just got the phone back on Jan 26, and it is working not.I am further upset since the price was dropped by $30 right after I purchased it.The con is that the screen is really sharp. This is slightly larger in size than Atrix 2.",Bad

"The phone turns off by its self with no warning, the music is constantly interrupted or pauses its self. The speaker is very very low you can barely hear it. The touch is so sensitive that when trying to just scroll your opening pages instead and having to go back a lot.

I don't know if I just have a defective device or if all of these phones are like this.",Bad

"I've had the phone for 2 months now. First month worked great, now starts rebooting throughout the day, and is not functional. The battery definitely has crapped out and does not work anymore, so I'm praying it is not a faulty phone. While cell is plugged in/charging says battery at 100% and phone turns on, occasionally. The minute I unplug the phone turns off then starts to re-boot by itself. I've tried different compatible replacement batteries, but none worked, even thought they say ""BL-53YH""--costing me about $12 each. LG doesn't even sell the batteries for this phone anymore; I'm thinking of trying one more from amazon...this is such a nuisance!! Guess I should have just dished out the $500 bucks for a new phone at AT&T store.....ughh!!",Bad
"BEWARE WHEN BUYING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! The phone works fine, however I so discovered the phone was not ""new"" as I purchased. The screen had been replaced. I figured this out as the screen stopped turning on and pressing near the home button would cause the phone to reset. I took it in for a diagnostic today and it turns out the team there said the screen wasn't adhered properly as the factory would do, so just normal everyday bumps over time caused the connecting ribbon to short circuit, causing the resets and eventual failure of the screen. My advice, look elsewhere when buying.",Bad
I purchased this phone but you cannot send or receive pictures even though it's a camera phone. I wish they told me that before I purchased it!,Bad
"For some reason, you guys sent me an European version, it has worked good until now, but I don't know if it will cause me any trouble in the future. Also I can't charge it because the charger that came with the phone is designed for Europe.",Bad

l am a blackberry fan for a long time but now I don't like their poor performance in the telephone industry. they have lack of apps and instead of adding more features they take off the best feature that no one else ever has which was ON and OFF. That feature let the telephone to become on and off itself at the time you like. Now we have to do it Manually and that is not cool. The other issue blackberry has is that there is no an option to control Device Password and that is very vulnerable to steal. The thief all he has to do is to type wrong passwords only 10 time to own the phone then the security wipe will delete all the data on the device. The only thing good about blackberry is the calendar that you can do with everything you want like everyday 12345 and so on you name it. In this case I am only giving two stars and wishing them good luck.,Bad
"You can't expect a lot from a low cost phone. The text in the manual is very small, the instruction for inserting the sim is extremely poor , The battery hardly fits in the phone, the instruction for opening the phone to change the battery is non existent. The sound quality is okay. There is no button to control volume you have to navigate into an option which is not easily found to do so. IT did accept the Tmobile sim without problems.",Bad
Had a very bad experience with this product . Cellphone stopped working after a month and still giving lot of troubles . Beware of this Seller,Bad
"Defective phone. Within days of getting it it started giving me issues. It all started when it turned off randomly and wouldn't turn back on. Eventually I got it to turn on and I disregarded it. However it was very unresponsive and eventually lost hearing capability for media through speakers or headphones. Instead of hearing what you want to hear, a weird buzz/hum is heard. I love the 4s but this one is bad and I will be returning it.",Bad
The quality wasn't that great. Touch screen doesn't respond as well as it should. Already looking for another phone....,Bad
"I understand the product was used, but WOW!! The seller failed to mention the battery has a crack in it. Also, the phone was NASTY!! This phone looked horrible!! I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I did get it switched over without it being prepaid. Just not happy with the condition of the phone and the dirtiness. There were also saved text messages on the phone, no big deal. But one was about having sex with a llama. Didn't need to read tht. Oh, and the charger is not the right charger.",Bad

"I got this phone because in the description it said it was ""like new"" but when I got the phone, there was an approx. inch scratch on the screen of the phone. The reason I gave a 2 and not 1 star was that they were willing to take back the phone and exchange it, but that is after I ship it to them, they take 24 to 48 hours to inspect the phone, and then wait for the replacement phone to get her. Not likely. I am unsatisfied and the next time they want to sell a phone with a scratch on it, I hope they explain the defect in the description. I hope that this helps.",Bad

It will not connect reliably to any of my bluetooth devices (even though every other family members' phones work with those devices and they have various brands/models). Since Blu does not appear to be committed to fixing the issue or even acknowledging that it exists, I will be returning my phone.

And I got three of them! I am stuck with three useless gadgets, and I bet phone recyclers will soon have a freebie from me, courtesy of some smart hoodwinkers in HK!!

I did not want to return it because I was going out of town during that time and returning it would have been a huge pain. However, the device I received worked perfect and although it was not what I expected, it sold it to my friend and got some of the money back. I had a horrible experience, and I do not know why they advertise something that is not true.",Bad
"awesome phone, it worked in PureTalk,rated below after use of one month, battery dying and phone is not ringing for the incoming calls,",Bad
Only 3G no good for me...great screen and all but not fast enough for my neywork and today's standards.,Bad
It was a clean and good phone. The screen had some light scratches but other than that it was ok!,Bad
For the last month that ive owned it this phone has been glitching out. The phone will turn on when i dont touch it or it will turn off while im using it it will open apps without me touching it and it also will just go from fine to being unuseable in a matter of min. i just looked to see if i could have it sent back to be fixed but the warrenty was discountinued by asus. wtf i paid $450 after tax for this phone and i cant send it back to get fixed that is complete bs everything on this phone is great exept for when it becomes completly unuseable about every 2 hrs then it will glitch out so i cant even turn it on for more than 3 sec. till it turns off or locks my phone because the phone keeps trying to put in the password itself. ive tried every fix that i can find online none work including a hard reset or wiping the cache i wish i bought the lg or samsaung my friends recomended,Bad
"At first this looked like a nice phone but after having it for several months it has had several problems. Most of the buttons on the front never work and the rest only work some of the time. I have also had problems with the keyboard working properly and I am not a fan of the touch screen on this phone. Overall, it's a very cheap phone that will not last long despite not being put through any abuse.",Bad
"The product was not good, it always went off and the screen did hang most of the time. Even at the moment the screen is static for the last two weeks, I cannot call anyone or swipe to do anything with the phone.",Bad
They sent me the wrong phone...it is very similar but It wasn't the right one...but I needed a phone and didn't have time to send it back...so I have to put up with it...not very happy...it doesn't hold a charge very well...have to plug it in every day.,Bad
"I have had a lot of disadvantages to this phone first you can not download the applications and app WhatssApp, second world with the local venzolanas operators to make calls and messages as well as for the good team of everything",Bad
It was working and it started blinking after it shut down.the screen can't switch on now.,Bad
"I bought this phone as a replacement to wait out the two year upgrade. I received the phone promptly as promised but I already experienced issues with the charging port. That was the first issue.The second issue? I went to my carrier to have it activated, only to be told that the phone had been badly rooted - meaning the phone WASN'T NEW.Thirdly, the charger that came with the phone almost couldn't fit into the charging port on the phone and every other charger I've tried ended in failure - my phone battery dies too quickly and it can barely last the whole day.I've been contacted by the person who sold me my case and offered to replace it with another phone at the same price I paid for it. However, I have to cover the shipping cost for sending to them.While I appreciate the seller's efforts to enforce the 100%-satisfaction-guaranteed-or-your-money-back-rule, this is by far no excuse as to why the phone was advertised as new when it wasn't.",Bad
"Never been a huge fan of iPhones since I was able to escape the brainwashing after the 3GS. Only purchased this for my mother in law who, like all eastern Europeans, love anything apple because it's ""premium"". The truth is, the iPhone 5 is an outdated, small phone that's very overpriced on the market.",Bad
"Side and rear panel of Iphone 5 very easy to be scratching , chipping. I never seen any phone like that, even cheapest phone on market now. Sorry to spend a 3/4 of thousand dollar to buy this phone. I used 16G Iphone 4, this phone's hardware very good, that why I purchased this Iphone 5. This time I wasted money. Last month I plant to buy Iphone 5S. But I think New Iphone Wiil be WORSE.",Bad
"My Granny couldn't use the phone because she wasn't able to use the locking the phone function, and without the lock the phone called people when the phone was in her pocket. If the lock was easier for her, then this phone would be great.",Bad
"had already purchased a 3pk and needed 1 more, the 3pk were white, which is what I wanted, but the this third one is blackthe cordes and controller for the lights I needed it for are all white. if it isn't white then they shouldn't show it as white instead of blackbad for businessI contacted them w/no response frm them whatsoever",Bad
Bad battery. It discharges very quickly( faster than a regular smart cell-phone).You need to recharge it with a 24 h periodicity.,Bad
Stylus was not included as advertised .....Was in a different situation after gifted it some one else. !!,Bad
Bad reception and water damage not good at all makes you think before purchasing from amazon,Bad
Quality case but way too bulky. I had to send it back. The 6 plus is large enough and this just makes it feel like a tablet.,Bad
"OK so I'm not happy with this buy. The reason I rated a five because it's not his fault I got a defective phone. The camera doesn't work. Every time I would try to use it, would always say not available and shut down completely. To top it off I got it on a Wed didn't open it till Friday and the screen just stood on the LG symbol and lit up at the home button for hours. I thought it just needed charge. Nope not at all. Im just upset because I know this phone is a great phone but now I have to return it and go through the process again of ordering a new phone.",Bad
It did not bring a good charger was really unconfortable for me I had to buy a new one,Bad
"Worst phone ever, I had to send twice to Samsung for repair and at the end of the year mic didnt work so i had to buy another phone",Bad
does not come in box that is bad not wash brings to insert the sim card and cash are not nuebo are usedotherwise and binding to and release for Latin America if it do not work,Bad
"This is a great camera and calling device! The camera quality and functionality is absolutely excellent!However, due to the size of each picture taken, 32GB of memory is quickly exhausted. There is no memory extension slot.I really did enjoy my Lumia until one day (6 months old) the phone just shut down, and refused to be charged or restarted...I am now burdened with an iPhone 5s which by the way is way below par when compared to the 1020... I loved and miss the 1020 but for such a costly phone I did not get my money's worth ( 6 months of usage for over $625) such a ripoff.Btw, the phone was never dropped and was well cared for.I will not buy again!",Bad
"Yes, it does, the 128mb ram arent enough. The phone would be perfect if the people at nokia included 256mb ram. It is very slow and wo graphics accelerator so no fancy games or apps. Other than that it would make a DREAM PHONE. Too bad.OHHH and BTW, theres software included that you CANNOT DELETE, and the office part of the phone SUCKS too, you CANNOT EDIT office files, only view and the pdf reader is a 30 day trial. For that kind of money...",Bad
"The phone is a decent size. Here are the problems I have with the phone. It reboots by itself when I am reading or watching a video and I have to restart from the beginning again. The screen blacks out and none of the buttons would work and there were times where I had to remove the battery for the phone to restart it. Also, if I'm using my headset and the phone rings, the person calling won't be able to hear me unless I put that person on a speaker and then take them off the speaker. It is just inconvenient! The worst problem I'm having is that, calls go straight to voice mail and I'll only happen to know about it only if they leave a voice message. I called Samsung customer service and they said they won't be able to help me as the phone is an international version. I was trying to replace/return the phone and just found out that since the item was bought during Christmas season, I won't be able to return/replace it now. Very inconvenient!!!",Bad
"Got only Edge in 4G area. T-Mobile tech support tried to get it to work in different settings, could not. Edge only! Beautiful phone but according to LG for India market!!!",Bad
The description does not state the screen size for this version is 5.2 inches and will not fit in any of the 5.5 inch cases sold in the USA. DO not buy this. No way to find a 5.2 case in US. Dimension information is missing for most cases even if it states it fits your model phone. No way to call a vendor to get info before purchase of a case. Not good if you think you might drop your phone. Ever.,Bad
Did not fit my phone usable but u can tell it does not fit well,Bad
"If you need a rear camera do not buy this phone. Camera is blurry, does not focus and horrible pictures.There is no flash which makes the camera useless.",Bad
"They break very quickly, not long lasting and the touch screen is of poor quality",Bad
"not as easy as it should be to go thru the menus and buttons, Needs better labeling on the control keys. Also the 911 button is too easy to activate.",Bad
My problem was that my network is with Verizon not AT&T. Phones designed for one will not work on the other's network. This phone was designed to work with AT&T. I returned the phone.,Bad
It is a pain to get it to charge just my phone and my watch (iPhone 5; pebble time) also find it weird it comes with a dc power input but comes with a USB I get its a desk thing but maybe include both? Really disapointed,Bad
For a cheap phone it wasn't terrible except for the volume on the audio. Older person couldn't even hear it ringing.,Bad
This has got to be the worst phone out! This is my second phone like this cause I thought the first phone had a problem with it so stupid me bought another phone just like the first. The second phone is just like the first. Slow it can't do two things at once it freezes up. Only thing nice about this phone is the big screen.i will be sending this one back to you as well as I did the first one,Bad
"I got the phone, it had barely any scratches except for a small dent which was mention when i bought it. However, after a week or two it shut off randomly. Luckily, I took it to apple and they said they'd give me a new one no questions asked. Had apple not taken care of me, I would've been very disappointed with my purchase. I'd give it one star, but in the end I ""won"" by getting a brand new replacement.",Bad
"Haven't used it yet for phone calls.But when I check memory, I see 84mb used storage, and 36mb free after downloading google play (18mb) that's 120mb, not the 256 MB RAM advertised. Even the 256 mb was an oversight, and I shouldn't have gotten it based on that.If you're going to get this, just get a flip phone.Yes, you can use a micro SD card. Certain pieces of software can't be on the SD card though, and unless you like managing memory all the time, just spend a little more money and get more memory.",Bad
This phone is ok. It is not a 4g lte phone as mentioned In the owners discription of product. And yes i have a 4g chip. However this product passes. One more items. Phone was already programed so this product was new as also discribed.,Bad
"The phone is ok , but only when I have it plugged into an outlet , the battery last only for 11/2 hours before it goes completely dead , I think I should get my money back",Bad
"The operating system, features and aesthetics of this phone are just fine, but the only way I can call, send a text or get a call is if I have almost full service. If it has just half service or less it will not do anything. This is very frustrating, considering I rarely have absolute full service. I would not buy this phone again even if it was half the price!",Bad
"I purchased this phone about 4 months ago and from the time of turning it on to present I have been waiting on it to stop periodically sticking, shutting down without provocation and alternating between over-sensitive to my touch and completely non-responsive. I deeply regret not putting a few extra hundreds and getting an unlocked iPhone or Samsung. I just find it hard to let go of my Blackberry messenger service.Other than those issues though I have no issue with call quality, the package did arrive on time and was well put together. All wasted on a phone that I want to throw in the garbage!",Bad
"When I first bought this phone, I really did like it. The camera quality was really average, but everything else was okay, so I was pleased with my purchase. I've had it for a few months now, and I can only call it JUNK! The phone is super slow, it seems like the camera is getting worse, and today I couldn't even get it to come on! I'm looking for a new phone right now.",Bad
IPhone works and is like new and was unlocked. But its not The A1723 it's the A1662 with less frequency bands. The A1662 did not support all LTE frequencies outside the US,Bad
I like the fact that I was able to just pop my Sim card In and it worked immediately but I'm having issues with watching videos and playing YouTube. The phone seems very slow. I purchased a bigger version in the past that was way better.,Bad
Phone has some issues. When I'm searching the web it will just cut off sometimes. I can't hear well without earpiece.It continued to cut off when using the internet. I couldn't sinc it with my email.It finally died completely this morning. Not a great purchase. :-\Lasted a year and a half. 200 per year. Yikes.,Bad
I took it to Cricket wireless and they said I could not use this phone on my acct. Said it was not a cricket wireless compatible phone.,Bad
I buy this watch on here it dozen work well no signal in most area .it as no wifi it keep saying no service most of the place i go .not ringing im not please wit my watch look good but sucks,Bad
"The phone was brand new, and the shipping was on time. The reason why I am giving this product two stars is due to it not being unlocked, along with nothing in the package to unlock the phone. I had to get it unlock by another site. The description of this is false. But once it is unlocked it worked great.",Bad
The contacts are deleted from the phone directory. I need to upload a book with the phone numbers of my contacts for when I need not aparecen.La has long lasting battery and phone should be charged several times a day.Los contactos se borran del directorio del telefono.

"I purchased this phone for the dual cameras so that I can skype on it. It works fine for skype in an area with reception.***Be aware the reception on this phone is horrible. I can be in the middle of town and not be able to make a phone call because of lack of reception. I know it's not my phone service because my last phone with the same company worked great (it just didn't have a dual camera).*** If you use GPS on your phone, this phone is not for you because you will lose reception and therefore your GPS signal.",Bad
"I recently bought this cell phone, it was supposed to come unlocked, but no, this completely blocked. The google account is blocked surely with another person's password, Please I need HELP!!!",Bad
"the battery is not working now, it wasn't long time to now (just 9 month) so now, I have to invest to but a new buttery, not good",Bad
NOT A SMART PHONE!! we thought we were ordering a smartphone.. and boy were we highly surprised when we found out that this was a MAJOR downgrade,Bad
"this phone, just like my last My Touch reboots all the time, but I am not going to spend $600 for a new phone at T-mobile so I will keep this lousy phone till I dump T-Mobile",Bad
"The phone would not take/keep a charge. Because it was refurbished, I really didn't have much recourse. I gave up and bought a motorola GT",Bad
It's a mini versoin of the LG G3... except it's 4G band doesn't work much in the US. I ordered the wrong model... not happy and sending back.,Bad
battery life is like cell phones from the 90's. no news...you get what you pay for. xx,Bad
Product is not function properly. Ringtone was not loud and could not hear anyone on speaker. Other minor issues. Sent phone backk to Amazon for refund.,Bad
I loved the fact that this phone is red and it has a sliding keyboard with full touch screen. The price was great and I received the phone in a timely manner. The only problems were I could not get the phone to convert to my carrier for pic msg and the phone did freeze up a lot with the screen scrabbling at times. So I decided to send it back. I did receive a full refund so I would buy from the dealer again the phone had all I was looking for but had too many errors.,Bad
"I am really disappointed by this phone because there is no SD Card slot as stated in the product details. Was really looking to my expanded memory space, hence the reason I chose this phone above others. Would like some kind of redress.",Bad
"The Nokia 6350 itself is fine, but I needed an unlocked phone This phone from this supplier was not unlocked. I've purchased two other unlocked phones on Amazon and had have no problems using them on my network with my SIM card.I can't remember the exact wording of the message displayed, but I looked on the Internet and found the message meant the phone was still locked. I also found that unlock codes are offered online for about $20 with the disclaimer that the codes are not guaranteed to work. I decided to return the phone.",Bad
"Not too well .however, I have to used it.I actually buy it to send it to Africa for my wife. I thought it could make a voice call given the fact that it takes SIM card. But to my disbelieve , she calls and say it don't make a voice call. She has to used it for the unintended propose.",Bad
"To my dismay the phone was not unlocked, what an inconvenience ! Now I have to return the phone, ridiculous !",Bad
Came with European charger. There's been quite a few bugs. Group texting doesn't work without app. Camera is awesome! It want you to unplug it when it is charged but then runs out of battery by Tom. I do like it though just hope the updates work out the bugs,Bad
screens displayed upside down. dropped most calls. bad delay with buttons. Sometimes would give the blue screen of death and completely freeze. Would suggest buying legit phone from legit phone company,Bad
"This phone is GREAT. In perfect condition and works absolutely perfectly. HOWEVER, it was not unlocked like the seller claimed and I had to unlock it myself. I only bought this phone because it claimed to be unlocked. Very disappointed.",Bad
"BlackBerry Pearl 8110 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, GPS, MicroSD Slot, and Digital Media Player--International Version with No Warranty (Titanium)Purchased this from OEM Planet as an OEM plhone. what i got was a refurbished phone with a changed U-clip on the bottom, missing lens tapes as should be with new phones. Carrier branded wake up banner, charger was used, cable was in generic bag and no blackberry logo, battery was dead and used. this was completely not as described and not in correct condition. be very careful whom you purchase from.",Bad
Wrong usb core included in the package. I have to use a wire of mine for charging and connecting to my PC,Bad
"This Rugby came with no cover to the charging outlet. It also came with a battery which would not hold a charge for more than two hours. I tried to contact the seller multiple times and was unsuccessful. The Rugby is a good phone normally, but not this one. We finally put the old battery that we had in our last Rugby and it seems to be working will let you know if anything changes. I cannot recommend this seller.",Bad
"It was not marked as refurbished. However, Verizon verified it for me.As others have noted, it shuts off and restarts out of nowhere. For $60 you can get a better phone than this refurbished piece.",Bad
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",Bad
"The phone looks really good, but several features dont work. For example, althought I purchased a 2 GB memory card, I cant down load any pictures or video sent to me from friends and family members. The phone keeps asking for a media card. They need to stop selling this phone. It 's false advertising....",Bad
"Ok first off this is a Moto X that does work perfect, that being said there is no way this is a new phone. It has an ATT logo on the back and has ATT preloaded software on it. That should not be the case if this is a factory unlocked phone from Motorola. Also the accessories inside are not Motorola branded, just random POS earbuds, and USB cable. I did make sure I purchased this straight from Amazon instead of a 3rd party seller too. It is unlocked though as I put my Tmobile SIM card in it and it works. So in the end, yes it works and it's unlocked but this is not a 'new' phone :( Can't recommend this be bought from here because it's not what it's advertised as.UPDATE: 5/21/14 I called Amazon about the phone not being a new phone and they apologized and they cross shipped me another with overnight shipping at no extra cost. The new one I received is an actual brand new Moto X from Motorola with no carrier branding, just how it was supposed to be.",Bad
Okay but its glitchy and freezes and progressively got worse but since I had it for more than 30 days they wouldn't do anything for me.,Bad
After a day my phone would not register that the battery was charged. I can't stand not knowing if the device is 2hrs away from running out of power or 20hrs away from running out of power. The windows mobile features worked but the call volume was so low that even on speaker phone a person's voice could not be heard in anything but a quiet room. The keyboard and large screen are great but overall this phone is to big not to get in your way.(its slightly bigger than a DS lite) This product being returned.,Bad
"It works.... mostly. The speaker is broken so you can't hear the ringer or put someone on speaker to talk. Very disappointing. I just think the seller didn't check the phone out or try to repair the issue before mailing it out. I will have to see if a local repair place can get it fixed.I have another one just like this and love it which is why I bought this one as a second. It's a ""tank"" and works well as an emergency back up phone or as a prepaid phone extremely well. I put it on Verizon prepay plan for $5 at a time.",Bad
It never fit my phone properly! They inner casing never clicked closed and the plastic screen protector started coming unglued in like a week. Definitely would not but again. IDK if mine was just a bad one from the batch but it was just awful. For how much it costs its really not okay for any of them to be substandard.,Bad
time resets itself. loses sync even when phone is right next to watch. all features do not work.,Bad
"The phone came in great condition, it looks brand new even though it's refurbished. The only problem is the battery that came with it will only work while the phone is plugged into the charger. I wonder if this company will replace it since it's refurbished? Great phone, bad battery. Luckily I have an extra one since I have owned this phone before. Hopefully it lasts since I had that phone for 5 years. If they fixed this problem I would give it 5 stars",Bad
I don't know how people give 5 stars on reviews for this phone. Got one because I relied on people's reviews. Here's a couple main issues I am having:1. Picture is blurry. I don't know if it's the screen or it is something else.2. Can't read my US simcard which is a Tracfone. This is suppose to be an unlock dual sim phone.If you have any suggestions to fix these issues I highly appreciate it. But in fairness it gets in to my doorstep on time!,Bad
"Everything was in the Russian language, took quite awhile to figure things out so that the phone could be operated.",Bad
"I love the phone. I was however informed before buying, that the phone would be compatible with the T-Mobile network, but it is not 4G LTE compatible, so I feel like I have been lied to by omission.",Bad
"While the phone was unlocked as advertised, it ONLY WORKS WITH T-MOBILE 3G SERVICE. If you are using AT&T, you will be STUCK WITH EDGE. The company would NOT even respond to my inquiry about returning the product. All communication was going fine back and forth with the company until I asked about their return policy, at which time they would not even return my email.ONLY BUY IF USING WITH T-MOBILE.",Bad
I received this phone but it does not hold any charge at all. I was hoping to return it and receive my money back since we need to get a new phone.,Bad
"The phone is okay, looks a lil cheaper than what is shown. Delivery was fast",Bad
"Have to give 2 stars. This was a nice phone at first, but after about 3 months, I was using the phone and it just made a loud POP! I noticed shortly after that there was a single clean break down the center face of the screen. I chatted with Motorola and they said they had repairs starting at $100, no warranty coverage.",Bad
"For a flagship phone there is a LOT to be desired. The charging port is pretty wonky, to say that you have to fiddle with the cable to get it to work. The hardware buttons are already starting to act funny as well.I've owned plenty of high end phones, including the best from Samsung and Apple, and this is far below par.",Bad
"This phone would have been okay if it would have connected to my network. I have MetroPCS and it would not allow me to use data through Metro or the T-mobile APN. So, I assume it may have been a defective model, but just be warned, it could happen to you. It is a compatible phone seeing as Metro actually sells this model, but in white. Additionally, I noticed that the battery went down rather quickly when I was using it. Again, to be fair, it might be because it was a defective model. I really wish it would have worked because I love the interface and the 5.5"" screen is beautiful. The processor on it seemed fast, too. Sad I had to return.",Bad
"I purchased this phone as a replacement for my daughter's broken phone since we are not able to upgrade through our carrier for a few more months. Buying this phone was an economical solution to avoid the cost of repairing a cracked screen. The phone is actually a pretty decent phone for basic things like receiving and sending texts, however, being a windows phone limits the apps you can download to the phone. This phone does not use Play Store. Microsoft requires that you open a family account in order to download popular apps. My daughter and I spent hours setting up the account and trying to download her favorite apps but ultimately we gave up! Nothing worked so she basically has a phone that can only send and receive texts or utilize the preloaded Microsoft apps which she does not use. Not a good phone for a teen but okay for a short term replacement.",Bad
The phone does not provide more than 5hours of battery life in wifi mode and the battery keeps on draining even when stamina or ultra stamina mode is activated. Also the back panel gets heated up during charging or streaming videos or playing music. I am not satisfied at all with this sony product. I had ordered a replacement hoping that the next one would give a better battery life but it turned out to be same. I am going to return this product.,Bad
"The phone it's self is solid. There is WAY too much bloat and skinning from ASUS. It completely ruins the user experience. It will take you upwards of an hour to uninstall/disable all asus modified apps. Also if you arent updated properly, the Asus auto-start manager will block you from receiving texts, even if you exclude your txting apps from the block.Asus support is terrible. The unlock tool that asus published for this phone was not working, I called support and worked with them for over an hour with no resolution. They want me to RMA the phone and pay additional costs. No thanks.The front camera using the default camera app always defaults to a selfie beautification mode. This is really annoying and makes the front camera awful. You have to switch every time to the default auto mode manually. The back camera is pretty decent.",Bad
"I have tried using this phone with both T-mobile and AT&T service. Reception is poor, drops calls, loses signal in areas where signal is excellent and other devices work fine. When opening phone for use, it can be difficult or awkward unless you have fingernails and or small fingers. Annoying tone sounds while opening, turning device on and off unable to disable.",Bad
"The phone doesn't have a certain memory ""card"" that is needed to allow some features that this model offers, according to my son... Battery also is limited.",Bad
I got this phone and it was not working properly. I called and spoke with a representative and he stated he would send out another phone but never did and I waited a week then had to call back and get another phone. The screen stopped working.,Bad
"Not disclosed at time of purchase was that this is a Turkey Cell company branded phone. I would not have purchased the unit if I had known what branding it carried. Very annoying. Language issues. Still haven't cleaned up all the stupid little apps that litter the phone. And when I first selected a US AT&T branded phone, then had second thoughts because I didn't understand how branded US/International phones work, and canceled my purchase to clear up the issue, I was unable to go back and purchase the AT&T US branded phone. The price was raised on my views of my original purchase by more than $50. Then the day after I purchased this International phone the price on my original selection went down to where it was when I first selected it.Amazon's manipulation of prices to drive a specific shopper to what they consider the product they should have is not consumer friendly.The phone does work fine. Simply full of junk and a branded splash screen I can't kill.",Bad
"I purchased this phone as an identical replacement to the one I've had for three years. Unfortunately, I'm having the same problem with the new one that I had with the other one. It doesn't stay charged for a long enough period of time. I don't have a data plan and I don't use blue tooth so neither of those features are contributing to the battery running down quickly. I only use my phone for texting and talking.On the plus side, I like the keyboard very much.",Bad
"Disappointed - it has all ATT functions on the menus etc. I live overseas and wanted a phone I could use here. I cannot get rid of the ATT functions - I don't care if it's just the basic (calls, texts, etc.) but it has useless GPS, maps, etc. to me that I can't delete?",Bad
"the audio is damaged, and this very battered around the edges. not filled my expectations, disappointed",Bad
"I was not what I expected it to me and I did research on this phone but it still not right for what I need it for which was for business. Don't get me wrong the phone is ok but not for me it runs out of space to fast, it cuts on and off by it self sometimes, and it doesn't hold anything for a teenager this phone would be fine. I really want to try the vivo by this brand the brand I still like but not this phone itself.",Bad
"I was happy with the size, but it got hot when plugged in and that concerned me, so I returned it.",Bad
3 or more hours to recharge de battery and memory with 26 gb!!I bought something with 32gb.,Bad
"Slow, battery intensive, charges extremely slowly, camera crashes a lot, internet switch seems to be reversed with data, wallpaper is blurred always. Other than that it's a good phone.",Bad
"The internal antennae is all jacked up. I had to send it in to be repaired. Luckily I was under warranty. I had problems calling and texting where my friends with the same carrier had perfect service. Also, the side metal looking part was bent. I didn't notice that until later, but it's not covered in warranty.",Bad
"I am not very satisfied,but it's just ok but I was expecting a better performance from it",Bad
"This phone is probably the best for the price. It has a really bright screen, it's thin, has an sd card slot, fast processor, and front facing speakers. And it has nfc, which the new moto g, oneplus 2, and huawei p8 lite don't have. It's also going to be updated to get protected from the ""Stagefright"" bug soon. Nice to see a company caring about users.However....While this phone was in a bag it got cracked. There was a case on it but it still got cracked. The digitizer did not work so I shipped it to alcatel for repair and it is costing me $100 for them to fix it.So please buy a tempered glass screen, and don't put any pressure on the phone. I even noticed that if you press hard enough you will see spots, I guess from the lcd.If you are looking for a phone that doesn't crack easy and is similar price I recommend the OnePlus One. I've hade it with a small orzly fusion case and it isn't cracked. It does have a tempered glass on it but that's only been recently.",Bad
looks good but very flimsy. I thought i was gonna break my battery cover. power button required a firmer press to turn on or off device.,Bad
"This phone was locked, although I ordered an unlocked phone. It also came with a verizon sim although I ordered an international unlocked phone. Would not recommend this to anyone.",Bad
"It seems slow to me. I have had many IPADs, not a fan of this one.",Bad
Never getting one again took a week to get here when I paid for two day also it stopped working a week after I got it won't even turn on now just don't buy this at all you'll save that money and go spend it on an iPhone cause that's what I did when it broke.,Bad
Out of the box the Wifi doesn't work. The audio like doesn't work either...atleast the speakers work....not buying a motorola again,Bad
"I'll start by saying this phone is the perfect size, I really wish more phone manufacturers would make phones this size. Also the camera is great and on equal level with a galaxy S7. Unfortunately the phone gets pretty hot under normal use, and the UI is very buggy which makes the phone unenjoyable to use. Hopefully by the end of 2016 we will have more phones that are around this size and not be so limited in our phablet... I mean phone selection.",Bad
My Android died so I wanted to get something nice but simple and inexpensive. This phone had so many bugs and problems that I ended up having to find a new phone faster than I wanted because it wasn't functional. The screen quality wasn't good either. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because I had a friend with the same phone and hers didn't seem to have as many problems. Save yourself the hassle.,Bad
"Bought this phone in the States to use in Europe. Nice phone, but it is locked to Verizon. Let the buyer beware!",Bad
It actually was pretty cool but ended up returning it because the camera was coming off the back. That was the only major defect since the camera was 16 mgpxls,Bad
"It wont work with tmobile because when the phone came it was in a at&t box so the data does not work because there is no tmobile my account on it,instead there is my at&t.",Bad
"i got a broken batery, it doesn't work. the screen has a pale spot, it looks like the surface is sticked to the inner scree",Bad
The Cellphone was sold as compatible with a band i could use with my mobile operator but it didn't. The seller had the description wrong. The cellphone is pretty good but I can not use it where I live.,Bad
"Get stuck constantly, the screen is very weak in comparisson to its competitors, the thetering doesnt work at all. Really sorry about this adquisition.",Bad
"I am editing my review. At first I gave a glowing review after only using this phone for one week. However, not even a month into using this phone the GPS quit. I was completely lost and went an hour out of my way. If I were by myself it would be not that much of a big deal. However I had my infant son in the car. Then the phone started making selections on it's own and acting improperly. I am returning it and getting my full refund. This phone LOOKS pretty, but becomes useless after a mere 2 weeks. Paperweight.",Bad
"outdated phone. Does not work with modern sim cards. If you have a full size sim it will work, but features like internet are choppy because it is an outdated unsupported os now. design was good for the phone and very sturdy, but OS is now bad",Bad
"Bad radio. I have 4 yr old LG that works well at my home with AT&T (one bar). Once SIM moved to this phone it is hit and miss. While lying down on the table it gets two bars, receives calls and SMS. But when you pick it up call brakes and you can't place a call as well.With Verizon network connectivity is equally bad. I have flip phone on Pare Plus that works perfectly with Verizon networks (1G and 3G) even from the basement. I moved my number to Red Pocket CDMA (also Verizon) and this phone is equally bad on Verizon. I could place a call and I hear other party but other party does not hear half of the words. I made a call to a landline and yes, problem was this phone. Had to transfer account back to AT&T.It might work for places where reception is good but in the gray regions it is not acceptable, worth than any phone I had so far. It is compatible with Page Plus, Red Pocket and other Verizon, AT&T MNVO.",Bad
The case is really cheap cracked first day I got it and I didn't drop it.,Bad
Camera on phone is crappy that's really all I look for one phone other than that it's a good phone.,Bad
The phone had a burnt in shadow of the keyboard when it arrived. Other problems I've noticed since purchase are: it randomly shuts off when trying to take a picture sometimes and it gets really hot when running Waze/Google Maps.,Bad
"I was really excited when it came. After a short use i quickly learned that the battery would not stay charged. Battery power fluctuated up and down quickly. Would Charge over nite and it would show 60% charged. After repeated attempts to maintain phone connected to web for data it never does. 5 calls to tech support only solution offered was a master reset. I did not buy it to have to reset it repeatedly to work right for short periods of time. It has now gone back to motorola repair center. Although i doubt they will succeed. I say that because they did not want the battery, charger, sim card, memory card sent with the phone for service. How can you trouble shoot a phone with half the things that work with it?",Bad
"Bought this for my husband. Very poor sound quality. It was difficult to hear who ever your talking to, and there was an echo. Returned.",Bad
"I have had this phone since February and it has gone downhill drastically. Now the phone will not charge to full capacity without being powered off. In two hours the phone has reached than half of its battery life. The phone locks up continuously. First bad experience with a BLU phone, but probably will be my last.",Bad
My personal opinion is that it looked like a refurbished one.Because it had some dirty spots and small scratches in the sealed box.It looked like they repacked it again with dirty hands and attached labels.Just let me know if I don't exactly understand the process of packing the new product.,Bad
"Worked great for the first 3 months than lose it's performance. Probably received a defective unit just like the bunch Sony produced. Many of their phones are faulty considering many users are facing similar problem as me, the phone keep restrating constantly I can barely use it . Tried every tips still won't solved the problem. Front camera takes bad pictures in low light, pictures get blurry blurry and retouched automatically when taken. I will no longer need buy sony smartphones for that I can't take the risk.",Bad
"placed in the description that are new, and come with many stripes and details. DealFisher seller",Bad
It only work on 2g speed on T-Mobile. You can't use your headphone or AUX cord. This phone is not the best but it look cool,Bad
"In the zone where old Nokia 6350 is showing full bar, this phone was jumping from 0 to 40%. Numbers and letters are not contrast at all.",Bad
"Phone arrived on time as promised. However, I am running into some issues with the software which I've updated to the latest version.. I'm trying to get the phone to work on Tmobile here in the US and am unclear how to get support. Part of the problem working buying from a 3rd party manufacturer. The G-900M system comes preloaded Android 5.0. Two main issues so far.- It appears that any app that calls on location software crashes immediately, except Google Maps. I've updated the SW from the factory settings. So really unclear if this is an issue with the factory settings, or an issue with Google or an issue with location services on the phone.- Then since this a non-Tmobile approved version of android. Little things like the option to enable wifi calls are not showing on my phone.As I've said, not sure who to call about support on this being a 3rd party phone.",Bad
"Not reliable wireless connection , low quality pictures, some times working fine but sometimes not working at all, Do not recommend to buy th",Bad
"I bought it in view of my international travel and to have an experience of 3G phone.But it did not work in India!I am totally disappointed! I may never attempt to buy phones online, especially NOKIA!Though it is mentioned as Nokia E71, it has another number besides written in small fine print!Though I took it to the Nokia service center for reformating and they charged Rs 310, it was useless. Looks like they took the money and did nothing!!I lost my opinion about the Nokia Customer care as well!I wonder why they call it unlocked, when it is locked to North America!",Bad
"Tried to complete a wireless update and the phone wont come back on, it boots in recovery mode only. Called Blu Tech support which is only mon-fri, and they could not fixed the problem attempted to contact Amazon for another phone",Bad
Icons was burn on the screen and the charger didn't even work. Had to use my old one from previous phone.,Bad
"Ended up returning to Motorola for a replacement as it would not hold a charge. Not sure what rocket scientist at Motorola decided to start making batteries PERMANENTLY attached to phone but he should be working in a donut shop. Now to get phone to operate properly you must return it to Motorola, BE WITHOUT A PHONE DURING THIS TIME, and await a repair or replacement. Smart move. Fortunately after enough complaining on the phone to Motorola they agreed to send me a new one overnight shipment BUT charged my credit card $5 (which was to get the number in case i didnt return broken phone) fee. Be wary of ads for ""new"" phones.",Bad
Doesn't seem to be as durable as other name brand phones. My daughter dropped hers and screen shattered completely unusable. I cracked my Samsung 5 over a year ago and it still works great.,Bad
I am not sure if this is the phone itself or the os but this phone wont connect to wifi,Bad
"Such a disappointment. I had high hopes for this one. Dual SIM & 100$, sounded too good to be true, and it was. The screen hardly senses touch and the camera is terrible! That said, I was traveling and needed a Dual SIM phone and this did the trick. No fear of losing or breaking it! Then, of course, I did break it and the only way to get it fixed is to send it to Southern Telecom, which charges $75 for shipping. Yes, that is what two costumer service representatives told me ( I called and had an online chat). Also, costumer service was terrible. One was so busy reading the script, they asked me the same questions 10 times, but would not answer mine. The chat representative answered ""You can do that"" to my question of whether or not they had a dealer in my area - I never even said where I was chatting from. Just w/ customer service alone, I would rather buy a new phone - def not polaroid!",Bad
The box was already open when the phone came.... I doubt about the newness of the phone,Bad
"I was expecting to receive it in black, but it was white.However, it was seized by the French customs so I had to pay 109 to take it back.Disgusting!!!",Bad
"Great phone, unless it fails..... Nokia and their service agent apparently believe either your phone service is not important or you have multiple backup phones to use while shipping your phone in for repair numerous times... Sent it back for the third time and they have had it for over a week....",Bad
It was working good at first but it's not a well known brand here and it started giving me problems and now I have to get it fixed. Waste of money.,Bad
I used for a day before I got rid of it. The battery is not all that good at all and it is a little show. If it wasn't for them two reasons I would have kept the phone. So I sold it to someone that needed a phone and lucky I got what I paid for it.,Bad
The phone works well on wifi but it hardly keeps signal for network coverage. Thinking about returning it. Very disapointed,Bad
I WAS TOLD I WAS BUYING A 4S AND RECIEVED AN IPHONE 4 NOT A 4S THE HOME BUTTON STICKS AND IT'S IN CRAPPY CONDITION!!!!,Bad
"I like the service but the phone wifi and hotspot don't work I don't know the reason why, that's why I like iPhone better or Sony Xperia Z3, I am stuck with this phone I spent my money",Bad
"The phone appears to be working just fine for now... Broke the screen when it was dropped.Took the phone to the Apple store only to be informed that this is is not an Apple phone. They told us that the blue casing is not apple, and that the screen all the way to the inner workings were not apple and that they would not touch it for repair etc. It appears this is a knock off. It is working so far but for how long. This seller advertised this as a new Apple phone- Buyer beware.",Bad
"Received the phone, took it out of the box and it had dead pixels right away. Try to fix with dead pixel fixer app, only made it worse. Requested a replacement phone, since I am at an APO I still have not received it. I purchased the phone as gift for my girlfriend, otherwise I personally do not like any Samsung phone. Have had nothing but bad luck with them and receiving this phone with dead pixels granted me the opportunity to tell my girlfriend ""I told you Samsung sucks"". Go with a OnePlus One phone - much more bang for the buck",Bad
Unable to close this product after opening to install the battery. The phone is defective so i had to return it.,Bad
"We have heard all of the hype and enjoyed all of the marketing. We bought this phone because it has a very specific application that benefits music majors & musicians.This phone would have been returned if we had bought it for any other reason. The ability to connect to the wi-fi network in our home, is horrible.The connection to the phone network is sporadic at best. Maybe after 5 versions of this phone they will get it at least partly correct, but it won't be on my dime that I find out.The sell was prompt, and got me the phone very quickly.",Bad
"good item, I thought, but when you use the phone keys they do not work to put in numbers. If you try to hit a key you get a key above or below it. thought I could adjust and figure out just where to hit key but impossible. Made paying bills and such an impossible task. It is good phone for all else. Wondering if blu can do an update to the graphics??",Bad
It heats up a lot. The battery life is terrible. Last about 3 hours until I have to recharge. The charging stuff it came with sucks too. Doesn't charge the phone at all. Had to buy another charger.,Bad
"I just recently got this phone and I'm disappointed with it. 1st the weight is not what i expected, thought it would be a little bit beefier. 2nd I have AT&T and the phone does not seem to want to connect most of the time. 3rd I find that it is a little on the slow side when opening and surfing. The description says that it will work on 2G and 3G but I can't say what it works on since I can't get this thing to lock onto AT&T. I'm sure it's not an AT&T issue, I believe it's mostly the phone since it's an international phone. When it was working the sound quality was great. If I plan on traveling abroad I'm sure this phone would be great but for now it's useless to me. The price was great and it took the larger SIM which is mostly why I got it in the first place. So for now this phone is going back and I'm going to keep looking.",Bad
Phone is only compatible with TMOBILE 2g data speeds your data will be slow with this phone. My daughter is very disappointed. What a waste of 200 bucks!,Bad
I over paid my phone bill for several months before I realized that this phone was 2G n my plan was 3G_Ù÷¤_Ù÷©_Ù÷©,Bad
Purchased this for my elderly mother.Pro-screen is good sizefairly easy to use if you do not have eyesight issuesswitch out mini sim card for easy set up.ConsMenu button is not easy to use. Other phones have easy to read arrows for menu navigation. This one does not. You have to press the side of the button in the direction you want to move in. If they had arrow or directional buttons it would definitely be easier for someone with nimble fingers or poor eyesight.Our phone must have been refurbished or used because the voice mail was registered to someone else. very strange since I thought voicemail set up was determined by your sim card/service provider.,Bad
"No 4G but that was my fault. Ordered a different phone with 4G LTE and reselling this one. The phone itself gets four stars. The purchaser gets one star so they balance out to 2 stars, LOL",Bad
€¡ payed for and expected dual sim phone. But they sent me a single sim phone. I decided not to go through the sending it back and started using this one. But that was disappointing. The rest is fine. Phone works perfectly. Even the colour is as on the picture,Bad
"This is my 3rd BLU phone. The first 2 were the Studio Energy 2 and those phones were very sturdy as well as dependable. This phone not so much. This phone has issues and I will not go into all of them but I will say the main two that made me return mine. First off when making a call the phone would just reset back to DOS mode or Android mode. It would say Android needs a password to reboot. Five minutes later I would be able to dial the number. The second issue that tops my list the speaker was horrible. It would be louder for music but scratchy and then too low for the ringer and notifications. I see more people are having the speaker issue as well so back it goes. NO the plastic was not left on it. This is how they are trying to explain away the issue on other phones they sell as well. This way the potential buyer thinks, Oh buyer mistake. This is not the case on most.Also no thanks to amazon for holding back my shipment. Took over a week for 2 day shipping. Zero stars to Amazon for that.",Bad
"This phone is not rugged. The packaging was also the chintziest I have ever seen. It is serviceable and basic, but it does not deliver on the ""rugged"" quality.",Bad
Good price but thats about allNot a quality phone. Can barely hear anything! It is for a child maybe,Bad
"Call quality is pretty awful. Gave it to my daughter and have noticed that my data, standing right next to her and on the same network (AT&T), will be totally fine and I'll have to turn my phone into a hotspot for her due to awful reception. Needs to be restarted frequently for freezing issues. Very glitchy UI.I only bought this because it said there would soon after be an update to 6.0.... 10 months later and it's still running the craptacular 5.x (whatever it shipped with). I notice there's no mention of it being updated anymore. Shame, it could have been an awesome phone.",Bad
"Based on the previous Samsung phones I used and fascinated by all the good reviews here, I decided to try the Galaxy Blaze but it was a disappointment. In the beginning, the phone was working fine. But after 5 months or so, the phone battery life has been dropping 10-20% in one hour! I tried deleting the apps which I thought were causing this issue and even tried it with a new replacement battery but it didn't help. Not a good product!",Bad
"Basically u get what u pay for. Dont get me wrong the screen is awesome and it looks the part. It does not perform the part, i compared it next to my step dads note II and it's really laggy, everything is so slow. The cameras flash doesnt work well, i couldnt get my netflix, hbo go, or cinemax go to work even on wifi!! The battery says it's a 3200mAh which should last from morning to evening even if u r cellular multitasking, and it only last me halfway throughout my day b4 i have to charge again. Like i said earlier u get wat u pay for.",Bad
"Phone works well except for WiFi aspect of it. If you have a data plan this is good, however if you are dependent on WiFi hotspots outside of the U.S. then this is not ideal. At home I have my WiFi connectivity in one specific room and if am outside of that room, this phone does not pick up the signal. All other android phones work, but not this one. I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. RCA should stick to tv's and vcr, not cell phones.",Bad
I read the reviews and started worrying that my torch 9800 was not new that i had purchased August 1.Surprisingly it was not new when it arrived.You guys need to stop deceiving your customers. Wont purchase anything more from this company.,Bad
I got this phone less than a week on monday.and i find out it frezzes up sometimes when making calls i hit the call button but it does not call also typing messages i hit the key but it dont write my message. Us really fuastrating. Anyone know what i can do,Bad
"I'm a business man who own[...] in Honolulu Hawaii. Cell phone is very important for our business, I been looking for good smartphone meet the requirements for our business for a long time, this Nokia E71 is first smartphone we ordered. But I'm so disappointed. We Ordered this Nokia E71 on April 16, 2010, we return the phone to Amazon.com within one day, because this phone has lot defectives. You can't charge the phone with min-usb(it's bad for business person because you always need to carry Nokia charger with you), also all the SmartPhone has key lock button on the side, but this Nokia E71 don't have the key lock button, make it difficulty to use when the phone automatic locked the key after 1 minute. This phone also can't record conversation. All those defectives make this Nokia E71 useless for a lot business person.",Bad
I bought this to replace a broken phone. Battery life is terrible. I am continuously recharging.,Bad
Don't like keyboard set up.. too many keys to the right of the actual lettered keys.. lose network constantly.. It'll have to do until I can get out of current contract and get a new phone with new service.. but I'm sorry I cheaped out and bought this one. Not real user friendly.,Bad
I think that some of them defective and I just got one of the defective onesVery slowBad signalScreen colors look fadedBluetooth week signalNot always switch between landscapes to portraitThe good about the one I have is the speakersAnd the battery lifeYou can't exchange only Send it back and get ur money back which in my case its 199 when new one cost 249,Bad

Bought two of these one in November and the other in December. Both of them are acting up ie the screen freezes or blanks out periodically. The slot for the headphones is not working. Would not buy a BLU again. Going back to Samsung!,Bad
"Got the phone and first realized that its Tmobile and not ATT. For 10 month was working fine till 1 day started rebooting every 2 minutes and then stopped working. When took it to the service guys told me not to buy refurbished phones in the future, because they are using not original parts or doing sloppy job putting everything together. Disappointing experience",Bad
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",Bad
"I bought this phone because of the camera and is very disappointed.Very bad camera's focus.It's for only static objects, macro , not for moving objects.",Bad
Makes large phone too big. Screen protector does it lay flat which causes issues with the touch screen. There must be iPhone 6 plus caseouttjete,Bad
"I did not receive an original Blackberry charger. No hands-free set was available. The unlocked mobile is showing ""My Number"" as some other number instead of my own number for the SIM inserted into. It was not at all a good deal for me.",Bad
"over all the phone is good for it's price but not quality. I guess you get what you pay!I own this phone for 6 months and it was dead now. I have no idea why this phone will AUTO RESTART the phone...at least once a day, sometimes 4 times a day! It was frozen at least 3 times a day.When I make a phone call, It takes about 5 second to connect...Again, this this phone only last for 6MONTHS, I got it on May2015, and the pohne was dead on November2015. So sad...",Bad
"This phone breaks easily. There's a reason they stopped selling it. Not to mention the description didn't say that ""unlocked"" does NOT mean ""Verizon compatible"". I wasted my money on a rubbish phone that I couldn't use.",Bad
Great phone but CANT BE UPDATED TO THE NEW SOFTWARE. CHECK THE SOFTWARE AND MAKE SURE YOU LIKE IT CAUSE YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH IT UNTIL YOU GET ANOTHER PHONE. I TRIED EVERYTHING!!!,Bad
It would have worked great. If it weren't for the fact that LG got fancy and has it fitted with a NANO-sim instead of the usual micro.,Bad
"Nice phone however GPS did not work, WiFi would not stay connected and my SIM could not be found at times. I was in contact with Posh to try to fix the product. The fix did not work.",Bad
"The phone itself is slick and great. I bought it because supposedly it's water-proof.But after about 2 weeks, there was more and more static in the sounds/notificationsounds and not there's just a slight crackle... and people can't hear me on theother end... a phone (phono-sound) without a sound.... Never thought SONY wouldscrew me like that.... I thought SONY was a respectable company.... now I haveto throw it away.... it's useless....",Bad
when i got phone it wouldn't work I took it to a Verizon store here the battery didn't work even when I charged it for 12 hrs Verizon put another used battery in phone it started to work,Bad
It's a good phone good engine nice size loveable keyboard pretty good working with amazon apps too just google app store it need to be completed,Bad
"The phone was fine except that within a week of having the phone it began to have problems charging...I bought several charges thinking that was the problem. It however was not the issue, it was the phone itself. I do not reccomend the item due to the fact that it was defective.",Bad
The camera sometime just in black screen and I can not use it.I have to reset the phone to use camera when it was in that trouble. It is really annoyed me,Bad
"I bought this phone because usually Nokia is great but this one will turn on and off while you're on a conversation, then it's extremely slow phone and when you turn it side ways you must wait at least a couple of seconds with a white screenåÁ!Getting another one is your best beatåÁ!",Bad
"malisimo this product is of poor quality, nothing to do with the characteristics I would do if I could return it,",Bad
The phone seems to be ok but the battery had to be replaced after less than 6 months,Bad
Please do yourselves a favor and never purchase one of these phones......The phone seems to work fine at first but then about a week or two into using the phone my daughters phone started acting crazy this phone has not worked properly from the 2nd week we got it. I paid a good price for a phone that has not been usable in just about the whole year I had it. I am sure the person welling this phone is aware of this and just continues to take peoples money and send them crap phones.........I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE A PHONE FROM THIS SELLER!,Bad
its not like my other phone when you type sometimes the letters are misprinted. I had to purchase a backup phone,Bad
"Overall is a good phone, but mine has problem connecting to WiFi networks. Almost everyime I want it to connect to de netgwork it says laghingå¬",Bad

"When I tried to use it, the volume button did not work at all!! I tried and tried but alli got was whisper amount of volume when someone called me. I had to return it to get a replacement. i am still waiting for it's return to me.",Bad
"This was a great phone expect for the fact that speaker did not work, so I returned it. I could hear people when they called me, but they could not hear me when I talked. It worked well in every other aspect and was in good condition for refurbished. It looked brand new, you couldn't tell it was a refurbished phone. I would buy another Turbo, because I liked the features and ease of use, but want the speaker to work :).",Bad
"this phone is quite outdated, it has limited internal memory with no option to upgrade, there is no wifi and doesnt seem to work with 3g or 2g. the phone i bought the bbm didn't work and i had to return it. Its not a bad buy if you just want a phone to make calls but if you need a smart phone this isnt it",Bad
I received the phone in record time however it came without the SD Micro storage card or USB cable. Much to my disappointment. Hence the reason for only 2 stars. The phone is working good so far.,Bad
"I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It's only the middle of May, 5 months after she got it, and the phone is already having charging problems, power on and off issues. She takes good care of her things and does not abuse them. We've both been very frustrated with it. We like the big screen, sound quality, and specs it promised, but the issues I mentioned are driving us away from ever trusting the Alcatel brand again. Not to mention, this is not the first Alcatel phone I own that I have issue with. I had dealt with the Alcatel Onetouch Fierce's sound quality going bad and touch screen not responding in the past after owning it for only about half a year. I thought I'd give them another try due to all the raving and good reviews. The Alcatel brand failed me once again.",Bad
"Well, I think that the phone its Refurbished, so I dont know why u put at NEW Phones, whatever i hope the phone work fine for a long time. If the phone its Refurbished just let us know, dont sell like NEW ONE. theres alot of pll scamming ppl, selling Refurbished as new one.. NICE for u.. NEW 230 USD, Refurbished 174, I pay 230 for 1 Refurbished! LOLdissapointed indeed.",Bad
"The phone was in PERFECT condition UNTIL I turned it on!!! It had ZERO scratches or dents and powered up just fine. But no matter where I was it took FOOOOOREVVERRRRRR to load anything, even with full 4G LTE signal. So, I ended up dropping it on the sidewalk and being happier because I switched back to my old phone with less battery strength but quicker loading speed. But I took a chance and got what I asked for so whatever.",Bad
"It is a nice looking phone. The shipping was awesome got it in like two days. Camera is ok not the best. I only hade it for one day and the next day I shipped it right back. It ran vary slow lagged alot, froze up a good bit. Don't know if I got a defect or what but I was vary disappointed.",Bad
When I got this really delayed item the charger did not work I had to use one of mine and the slide out keyboared not smooth at all,Bad
"The phone its self is okay, main application, but it‰Ûªs not compatible in Africa, The only thing that this phone is able to do is just used it as an ordinary phone. It cannot be connected to internet as it cannot be activated by the local phone providers. The only time that you can use internet is when you have WIFI which is not possible in Africa-Zambia. When you want to recharge you pre paid card with airtime, you have to remove the sim card put it in another phone. I am not sure its worth the money if you are to use it in Africa as this is a Verizon Phone.",Bad
This phone came without a dialer installed. I bought and paid for a phone that I can't even use to make calls!!I had to start using 3rd party software to be able to call anyone. That software has ads!!Spend the extra $20-$50 for a name brand phone. Or risk being stuck with a phone you can't even make calls on!!,Bad
BUT IT COULD USE SOME MORE INTERNAL MEMORY BUT WITH A LARGE ENOUGH SD CARD YOU CAN GET ALL THE APPS THAT YOU NEED,Bad
"Had to return this phone immediately because it wouldn't work. Came with a user manual in some Scandinavian language. Tried to charge it but it wouldn't turn on, I had the battery in correctly. Couldn't troubleshoot because, of course, I couldn't read the manual.",Bad
"It arrived with some screen issues, couldn't solve it nor return it. It was a waste of money",Bad
The left side of the touch does not work at times. I am going to return it.,Bad
The phone had been opened. 3 Screws missing along with wifi connector clip and antenna clip under battery connector miss placed. Result little wifi connect ability. Hidden damage.,Bad
It was delivered with a faulty charging cable and couldn't replace it since my brother has taken it to India,Bad
Phone software was out of date. I took it to the Verizon store and they said the phone was not worth the money that was paid for it. The phone is very slow. Can't get on the internet etc.,Bad
It is not working properly for t-mobile carrier. Cannot talk and access internet at the same time.,Bad
"Ive never had an issue with certified refurbished items with amazon before so this is kinda disappointing. No big flaws or damage, screens fine and almost 0 body flaws on the phone, however the volume rocker is jammed in, so you cant actually do much because it constantly pushing a volume up command and pop up, ive tried resetting and taking out the battery but no dice, and it is stock so not an app conflict or anything. Just sucks but i guess ill try returning it but this has definitely made me wary of their certified refurbished quality",Bad
"I have buy 4 4s, two of them are in white and others black, all marked used-good, the white is ok but the black really have poor quality, the steel outside if full of scratch and the edge of black glass is broken, i don't think it can make used-good. much more difference like the same grade white I received.",Bad
"Does not come with 8 Gyga card, stead 4 Gyga. Careful for the same price one can buy the C6 which is much better. I discovered it one day after I bought but the return fees from the seller would make it 50 U$ more expensive, so I decided to keep it.",Bad
"The functions on the watch are very nice, but the Bluetooth is not very good. The watch disconnects if i put my phone in my pocket sometimes. I will be returning tomorrow.",Bad
"But it brings all its accessories. not only original charger, battery and tlf. so you only need to buy at the store in person. not recommended for those who live in other countries",Bad
I don't like how it doesn't say note 4 on the back but other than that I think it was good phone.,Bad
"Although the set-up was a breeze, after several weeks I found myself longing for my old flip phone. I'd have to swipe the face five times before getting the ""home page."" Several times the face went blank and I'd have to re-start the phone before I could place a call. Even though I didn't surf the web frequently and used the phone mostly for texting and talking, the battery drained rapidly, requiring charges every two days. When asked to ""tap for a reply"" to a text message, I'd peck away at the bar and no typing keys would appear. When I turned the phone horizontally to use the larger keyboard, the screen often remained vertical, forcing me to use the smaller keyboard.",Bad
"Not as protective as the Defender I bought at the Verizon store 2 years ago. The rubber casing around the plastic case has almost no ""give"" and would seem to provide less cushion / protection n a fall or drop. It is more like semi flexible plastic. I will actually stick with the beat up old case and include this (as a ""bonus"") with a phone I am selling. I might check out the Armor model..... Would not buy this one again or recommend it to others.",Bad
"I really liked the phone: great size (I hate the trend to bigger and bigger screens like the Note2), fast, did nearly everything as expected.... but mine had one BIG flaw:When I lost the carrier signal the phone didn't reconnect: so it happened a few times that my phone was sitting on my desk for half a day without a connection (until I checked it) and after restart I had 5 messages on my mailbox.Don't know if this was a hardware issue on my phone or a general issue on the phone, but I'm sending my phone back.",Bad
I don't know why. The quality of s7 is very bad. I returned it twice. The vibration motor is defective and make noise or there is a little dust in the front camera......,Bad
"the cell phone color/paint is chipping on the edges and i have not dropped the phone, normal use. this phone was a ""refurbish"" phone which I was not aware of prior to ordering the phone.",Bad
"I've only had this phone for 6 months and it no longer charges or passes data via the USB port. I had to buy a spare battery and external battery charger to continue to use this. I like the phone itself aside from the port issue which has been a known issue with the Galaxy S III. It's still functional for now but not convenient. I've never had a phone break so quickly and I've had a multitude of phones. In fact I still have a galaxy S that my daughter uses and still charges file. Clearly the manufacturing on this model was not up to par and many complaints have been made about this device issue. That being said the transaction went well and this is not a commentary on the seller by any mean, just the quality of the handset as produced by the manufacturer.",Bad
"The phone arrives with some problems. The battery hadn't durability nore than 1 hour since the bigining ant the flash doesn't work as well.I have a friend in USA now with the device, How can we procede?Boris",Bad
The chargers are European with a US electrical adapter. Unfortunately the one included with my phone did not work so I called for a replacement. They responded however the replacement adapters consisting of two components fit so loosely that you have to put them in some sort of a self designed fixture to assure a good connection between the pieces and a successful charge.I asked for just a US charger but received the European adapters. Maybe Nokia does not offer this phone in the US and therefore no US charger??,Bad
"The phone seems to be decent, but I can't be sure. The listing says it is unlocked, and can be used on Verizon Wireless 4G LTE plans, but when I tried to activate it with the carrier, I was told it cannot be used with them. This was supposed to be my son's 13th birthday gift, now I have to make other plans.",Bad
i just got this phone and put my chip in it and the phone just keep freezing up.trying to charge it and its not charging. I am so disapointed,Bad
The website clearly states the phone can be activated on numerous prepaid networks but I have yet to be able to get it activated on any of them.,Bad
"The phone seems to be good, but battery doesn't work well. It takes a lot of hours to get fully charged, and battery it's low in a few hours. The charger doesn't work too.Shippin was OK, on time. It has no scratches.",Bad
"I ask for an unlock BB yes , i did got one , but was unable to use right away with out the aid of on unlocking phone store , i was not able to put my Sim card in and use it with any other phone other phone company. i was not not in form it was a sprint BB that need the activation removed. even removed i still could not use the BB . i add to pay additional cost to get it ready to international and local phone call. got two BB 9650 from this company and i was looking to order my kindle from amazon but i am reconsidering using amazon for technology buying, as much as i wish to use it easy of shopping",Bad
Phone was great until the software problems. Tried to repair on my computer and still didnt fix the problem.,Bad
"We had to send this back as it would not work on our Verizon service. It is advertised as unlocked for GSM. What it did not say is that it was locked for CDMA phones and cannot be unlocked except for a specific carrier. We needed it to work for our Verizon service, but the one they sent was locked for Sprint. There should be a place on the form to indicate what service you would like to use the phone on, so they can pick the correct CDMA for your particular network. Or explain the differences between GSM and CDMA.",Bad
"The phone does not come with a useful manual, nor does one exist. I am a pretty tech savvy person but the phone is not intuitive. I've searched everywhere online for videos, manuals, etc. Little things like learning how to use the alarm clock on the phone, or how to access contacts or navigate the main menu. I know it sounds crazy- like how difficult can it be-- but it's basically like a trial and error process for every single function of the phone since there are no instructions. Also, I bought it to use with a consumer cellular plan, which works fine (to be honest the phone does not always provide clear reception), but you cannot press ""1"" for voice mail. This means I had to call consumer cellular to figure out what the number to phone voice mail is.",Bad
"Really low quality build, dont fit and wrong product, because the seller (Wirester) intentionally send the wrong item without my approval.When i asked ""Why you send me the wrong item?"", Wirester said the one i ordered was out of stock, so they send a different product.I know It's only $5 phone case, but the way they do business is not right.The phone case i receive totally different graphic then the one displayed. Also the phone case cant close completely.It seems its a bit too small or not tall enough by a bit. So one end always open up cant be closed or clamped completely.I gave them 2 star, because they told me to return it and they cover the shipping.",Bad
This phone on the first charging started smoking and fried my very expensive laptop. The charging circuit pins were bent. I have extra charging circuits from a previous phone I fixed myself with. I'm not happy with the tradeoff I would rather the phone fry then my computer. Made in chine go figure,Bad
"Though they say it is new with the box, it is not. This cell phone does not even come in the origional box, let alone being brand new. I have seen and touched this phone years ago and it does not look or feel the same phone that I have seen befor. This phone was supposed to be gold plate, whic is NOT. Now I am stuck with this stupid $300 phone.",Bad
I did not receive a charger with the phone just the phone itself and it was not what was pictured for sale plus it did not interchange with my account I returned it and don't think its fair they are going to charge me a restocking fee its just wrong because the whole sale was misleading,Bad
Got the phone today and found out the OS has no Chinese language installed. Very disappointed and have to return!,Bad
"In January 2016, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S5 G900H 16GB Unlocked GSM Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera, Black (Certified Refurbished) [ASIN: B00SAJ3QNG] from BREED to have on hand as a backup phone. I presumed that phone functioned as stated, i.e. the phone would be unlocked. In August 2016, I tried to get the phone to work but the phone was locked and therefore inoperable for me. I contacted BREED and their customer service was responsive in a timely manner. BREED‰Ûªs customer service apologized for the inconvenience and said they would work with the manufacturer to get the phone‰Ûªs unlock code. BREED later responded that there is no way to get the unlock code due to the length of time passed since it was ordered. The customer service agent stated that the length of time was over one year however it had been about eight months. In my opinion, BREED‰Ûªs customer service is friendly and timely but ineffective. On the positive side, the device is at least able to connect to WiFi.",Bad
"The camera on the phone displayed in a ""negative"" view while taking photos. If you flip the lens to take a photo of yourself, the view was perfect. Returned phone 2-28-14. Waiting on a refund, so I can order another phone from Amazon.",Bad
"This is a great phone, however I think the seller should add in the description the bands this phone uses for 2G, 3G and LTE",Bad
"this cell phone i ordered was delivered on time for sure in new condition, very nice phone i liked it from the first day, but after a few days it started to malfunction , took it to verizon and they worked on it and told me to forget about this phone because LG had stop production sometime ago because of to many problems, so i returned it and i expect a full refund, i am very confident that amazon will come thu as ususual, thanks",Bad

"Seems like a good phone, but ridiculously fragile. Had it for four days and dropped it a foot with a case on it. The screen shattered and now I have to pay another $150 to fix it. So disappointed.",Bad
"I thought I was ordering a new Galaxy Note 4, but was mistaken. They are advertised as new but are refurbished. I repeat, these are refurbished phones and not new! Buyer beware. My phone arrived with a severely scratched camera glass, which costs me another $10 to replace. The display has light scratches. There is a space where the metal frame connects to the lower right corner of the phone. Lastly sensitivity is off on the back button. I kept it only because of the Note 7 fiasco. I'm tired of having to set up new phones. Everything else works fine, so I decided to live with it. This is an honest review from a customer who feels cheated.",Bad
"My issue is with this particular refurb: *Very much not worth it.*It failed shortly after the warranty period ends - this one lasted 5 months, and it then was deemed unfixable by a very good repair shop, that's done great work on other items and tried hard to fix this one.I'd avoid this particular refurb if I were you, in favor of another one for which you could buy an add-on warranty. Versus this one, you'd be better off paying full price for a new phone - on a month by month basis, it would cost much less.(The Nexus 5 itself is a great phone - I've been very happy with it.)",Bad
"The XpressMusic phone by Nokia is a great phone but after 2 months of using, problmes arise. Firstly the phones functions begings to slow down and this is without using the memory card at full capacity. To change applications takes about 30seconds or more and in some instances, it freezes!It has come to the point now where I have to remove my phone battery when it freezes.I would not recommend anyone to get this phone.",Bad
ATT has phased out the signal these phones receive in my part of the country. So it drops most calls.,Bad
After one month using the cellphone my cellphone became whit some problems the battery is not working well . The firsts 2 weeks was perfect duration of the battery was all the day now it's 4 hours. Approximately don't know why but I'm having this issue,Bad
"HAd a dell streak that i love, love, loved.....and then.. i dropped it, broken. this replacement was delivered quickly , original packaging. but GPS was glitchy, and phone also did not function right. sadly , had to return it. dell isn't making these any more , so i went to the only available ( similar size, functions etc..) option-- the galaxy note. If i get a little extra dough aside though i may put it toward the (pricey) fixing of my streak- as a back up..",Bad
"Very useless ""smartwatch."" Would consider saving a little more and buying something more like a real smart watch. I used it for about a week and decided to storage it forever. Also headset wire was broken. Think twice before getting it!",Bad
Temporary Phone Not Worth it for daily use at all!!!!!I gave it 2' stars because it does work for a few hours.1. T-Mobile is suggested2. SIM card must be compatible3. SD Memory card is suggested*Overall I'm quite disappointed!No standby; battery drain very quickly. The charge is slower. For me this is just a temporary solution for when I go overseas. *Warning: phone will overheat while chargin . Best to power off device!,Bad
"Bought 2 phones from them. Delivery was on time. As we started using both phones, they gave trouble. And it's not the network. The phone itself is nice but It giving trouble is making it very frustrating to use.",Bad
"I bought this phone hoping to put my own sim card. When I put the sim card in, it slipped inside. It took me a while to get it out and it was damaged. The phone reset itself from time to time and it had alot if glitches. I didn't like it regardless.",Bad
"Was not so pleased with phone, I placed 16g memory card in it and it still said memory storage is low, the volume level is low had to use the head phones other than that it perform ok. I was able to return it to Amazon with no problem.",Bad
I bought this phone amd I've not even had it two months and the speaker has already gone out of it.,Bad
"I've had it for a couple of months and now it is beginning to freeze at the worst possible time. I've moved all apps to the SD card, and it has a ton of available space and still freezes. Spend a little more money if you can and get the Samsung.",Bad
Touch screen broke. This was the second one I had that did it. They work good for about a year,Bad
"I purchased this phone about 6 month's ago. Phone is great!!! The problem is that the battery went dead already. A battery in a cell phone should last at least 2 years, and since I hardly use my cell it should last even longer. I have emailed this company over a week ago and I am still waiting to hear from them. I am very disappointed in their customer service.",Bad
"the phone was in a very bad condition, the microphone isn't working, has a lot of scratch and few time began working hard. So if you wanna buy a s3, buy new one",Bad
Supposed to be new in box was broken and even was refurbished according to Sony scam,Bad
MY EYES AREN'T WHAT THEY USE TO BE AND THE PHONE WAS TO SMALL FOR ME SO THAT IS WHY I SENT IT BACK!,Bad
AT&T told me that this is a 2G phone and that their towers around here are 3G or 4G. I am not sure if this is right because no one else mentioned that. I read online later that 2G (generation) networks are being eliminated by ATT.,Bad
"pretty slow phone, snapchat was unusable and lagged. its a simple video app and if it cant handle it then that says a lot about the rest of the phone. returning it for a amazon giftcard",Bad
Home Button broken (is pushed in all the way) and therefore an unreliable fingerprint scanner. B ware...,Bad
"Just tried to register the product today. Confirmed that I ordered the US version for the order. However I received an international version which I cannot register with Samsung. The phone itself is very nice, but cannot get any support for it. Will be contacting Amazon by phone.",Bad
"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. After 12 hours of charging, and after inputting all the billing and account information, and setting up a phone book online, I have been told by Greatcall.com that due to an unprecedented backlog of activations, they won't be able to activate for ""several days"". I spoke with a manager, who could not be more specific, and refused to waive or give me a credit on the activation fee, which I have already paid. This phone was for my 80-year old mother, who is in a nursing home, and has no way to call her friends. I can only hope the actual phone works better than the technical and customer service staff at Greatcall.com.",Bad
"The phone I had previously was middle of the line phone that was 8 years old before if bit the dust to general wear and tear. That phone was pretty basic as you might imagine, and a lot of people poked fun at that phone. So, when I finally upgraded I didn't cheap out this time and bought name-brand off of the recommendations of those same people.Here I am, 4 months later. My phone looks brand new still because I take great care of my stuff. It's broken. Just broken. One day, it decided it didn't want to live anymore and I can't even find a shop to repair this phone. The screen no longer turns on. Oh, the phone still works alright, you know, if you can somehow use it blind. I had pretty mixed reactions about the phone's size, built in apps, OS, etc. I thought this phone was totally overrated as my old phone seemed more reliable and better put together in nearly every aspect except the actual physical build. But then, this phone only lasted 4 months, so...Yeah it's getting 2 stars for that.",Bad
"I bought this phone on Jan 7, 2016. This was my first phone and I was really excited because it looked so cool. I was happy with my purchase for the first few weeks but then I started noticing the battery draining really quickly. This was a new phone and I was already disabling apps that I can't uninstall and don't need and using power saving mode, airplane mode, etc. I charge it to 100% and after 10 min use its already 90%. Really disappointed with the battery life.",Bad
"I bought three cellphones. One is detective, curved screen. It does not support the glass. As I can make the seller replace the productos because the warranty is valid? Thank you",Bad
"It's sturdy. I used mine to release aggression. I'd thrown mine hard many times, squeezed it, twisted it while open. The weakest part is the plastic holding the battery in place, it broke when I threw it against a wall at work as hard as I could. I had to permanently glue the battery in place with super glue. I think this phone died after I twisted it in half while it was open.I'm only giving it 2 stars because:1. The speaker is horrible2. people had a hard time understanding me3. 1 and 2 caused me to attack the phoneIf it weren't for 1 and 2 I'd probably rate this a 3 star phone. If they also got rid of the side buttons it might be a 4 or 5 star phone, they were frequently accidentally pressed.",Bad
No NFC so cannot use android pay.. If u want automatic payment through your phone... Look for another phone...,Bad
"just recently got the phone. out of the box it was okay, nothing crazy fast but it was decent. then i started noticing how the reception on it was so much worse than my old phone, always randomly losing signal. Not a huge deal but i wish it had a signal led for messages and such. Also for an 8core processor it wasn't as fast as i expected it to be, in fact with the new found reception i got along with the phone it felt much slower then my previous phone( the Blu Life view, Loved it.) And as of now the phone is no longer charging, seems something has happened with the usb port. Just disappointing considering i've only had the phone a few months or so. Although i didn't have a problem with the Bluetooth like others have said, but i did run into just about every other problem.",Bad
Phone freezes during operation. restart doesn't always work and it can take up to half an hour until the phone starts to respond. The phone was sent back.Hope problem will be resolved.Nice design.,Bad
"The overall physical look and feel of the phone is great, screen resolution, buttons etc. but it really lacks in performance. It had a hard time playing the simplest games and it was pretty laggy like it does not have enough muscle to support the high definition screen. I really liked the phone, it was beautiful and the size was perfect but I ended up returning the thing. I'll probably buy it again if BLU does an update on it or something that will make it perform like the way it should.",Bad
"The phone itself is awesome, but, if you are a high-end Android user, you may want to look elsewhere to buy this phone. This is an international version of the phone which means, the phone can't get some basic apps like Microsoft's latest Word version. I'm also concerned this will greatly impact getting the latest Android version. The phone's location is listed as United Arab Emirates and can't be changed. This won't be a big problem for the casual user, just power users. I'm a power user and wish I would have paid a little extra for a US version.",Bad
I ordered a gold case with midnight blue band. Upon arrival I received a silver case with white band.,Bad
"Pros: Screen resolution is good, sound quality is good, physical keyboard is responsive.Cons: Touch screen not as responsive/precise as a smartphone.

I was satisfied at first but once the phone died abd charged it never turned back on so i am returning the phone what a waste of money,Bad
"Phone was very, very sluggish. Apps froze all the time. Screen is very grainy. GPS (which I use a lot for my job) was all over the place. It seemed to freeze or misread my location often. I'm returning this phone. I've ordered the Lenovo 5.5 phone that has much better specs. It costs $36 more, but money well spent to have phone that can at least work most of the time and handle everyday tasks.Some pros is that it had a nice heavy weight to it. This might not be a pro for you, however.It also came with a nice case and screen protectorsThe biggest pro was the battery life. Of course with a new phone it is always good but this one seemed especially long lasting. Probably because of the huge battery size.",Bad
My Verizon Samsung Brightside will not hold a charge and I've only had it for about two weeks. I'd like it if it worked properly.,Bad
"First of all, this product came delayed in shipping. One week late to be exact.Second, the cable charger usb that comes with the product is missing a line, slowing down my charging. Another small issue is that the charger plug is big and doesn't fit in most power extension cords.There is also a small heating problem with the phone when using it to play games or for long periods of time.For my personal preferences, I dislike the phone because all the buttons are very sensitive; even the power and volume buttons are sensitive and easy to press on.",Bad
"First the design and battery life were incredable, call quality was excellent.The Bad points of this phone where the screen is terrible, the Wi-Fi drops in and out.If you hit the Wi-Fi button Wi-Fi shows that it's on yet it's not connected.If I needed it just for the phone I might buy it,but the camera is very bad with no macro or auto focus.I returned the item because of the Wi-Fi back to Amazon and received a refund.",Bad

Small screen size and poor screen quality. Recommended for people who want the illusion of owning a smart phone. Start-up time and battery life are above par.,Bad
"I've had this phone for 7 months and on almost a daily basis, I exclaim ""I hate this phone"". I've had midrange phones before and really liked the Asus Zenfone. But the idol 3 is very slow, locks up a lot, has a lot of missing functionality that just seems like 'I can't believe you can't do that on this phone' kinda stuff. Also I was expecting a lot from the dual speakers and have been very disappointed in the sound and loudness of them. The camera is pretty dreadful, just terrible pictures and the video recorder is awful in terms of functionality. I think I'll go back to Asus when I can justify buying a new phone. Maybe I'll accidentally drop this one on concrete.",Bad
"It makes and receives calls very well and text messages, but that's it. Not a good phone for heavy data usage.",Bad
"Bought this phone for a research project I'm doing in Southamerica. Two major negatives:-After a 20 minute call, the phone started to heat.-Doesn't ring/vibrate. Tried using different sounds, etc. Couldn't fix this so far. I'm missing all calls.+ Works in Argentina.Would not buy it again.",Bad

"GPS function died within 6 months. Phone is sluggish during routine usage and touchscreen is inaccurate. Battery life has become progressively worse over the last few months, so I'll probably replace it with a flagship device this holiday season when phones go on sale again. I can't really recommend this one for most people. It's ok, I guess...but it's too expensive to just be ""ok"".",Bad
"This phone is definitely not what I expected there is not a lot I'm able to do with it. I know it's not an android phone, nor a smart phone, that I did know when I purchased it. But now because of this phone, looks Like I'm going to have to upgrade. I can't even get on the internet with this phone, nor can I send pics. and that's not good at all.",Bad
"I love this phone, and the operating system is actually pretty nice seeing as I came from iPhone. However, since the day I got the phone, I have been having random reboot problems 6 or more times a day. I'll be using it and it will all of the sudden turn off and back on. I've looked for solutions, tried updating it as much as possible, and even wiped and reinstalled twice - all to no avail. This seems to be a very common problem so I will be returning this phone and switching to Android, I want nothing to do with Windows Phone anymore.",Bad
Takes great pics but all it does is freeze! First my screen stopped then now it freezes alot smh i am not satisfied! Do not buy!,Bad
"it worked well for 2 weeks but now the screen ""spasms"" all the time. I cant take photos and often cant select an icon while this is going on.",Bad

"I got this phone this morning.. as a replacement for my old phone. And it works okay very slow at times.. The little moving ball only woks when you move it to the right, up, down, but NOT left. When your making a call and you put your face up to the screen it goes black then when your done making the call or you need to use the dial-pad it doesn't always show up so you cant access that menu, or hang up the call.. Got it refurbished and EVERY other Refurbished phone I have gotten is like new! this is a let down.",Bad

The Phablet seems to be okay except it advertises to go with Straight Talk but I can't find the right Sim card package from Straight Talk so it looks like I will be returning the BLU Studio 7.0 II,Bad
"As much as I would like to like this phone, I returned it as it is way too overpriced for it's performance. Lag Lag Lag.... screen also lifts on the bottom corner like the glue is dried out and does not stick. There is yet again pinkish tint on the top half of the screen. The 2.5 d curve on the sides of the screen make it difficult to find a tempered glass screen protector, and to date, there is nothing that can be used that does not produce a halo around the screen. Qi charger is NOT built in, and the original samsung Qi back is very thich and AGAIN mmakes it difficult to find a case. Though the Verus Thor works, the back of the case lifts up.I have wasted a lot of money trying to find the right accessories for this phone and am tired and skint of doing so... goodbye samsung",Bad
This phone was a bad decision. It has a bad touch expperience. Sometimes you push and you dont receive any response. Battery life is very bad. Im not sure is 2500mh. Realli Im dissappointed. I give this phone to a firend.,Bad
"I received my product it was working okay until the seventh day. Product stopped charging by outlet then, could only charge by my friends PC. Given this information I would tell you, once you receive the product make sure it does charge via outlet not PC, and make sure there is nothing in the charging port (where the charger plugs into), and that the battery is not damaged. Also, see how long it would take to charge to 100%. It took this phone to charge 8 hours to get a full 100% charge. I would NOT order this phone again and or recommend this phone to a friend for them to buy.",Bad
Bluetooth will not connect to my wireless earphones. It also not as receptive as my old Note 2 to my T mobile network. Shows only 1 bar or less where my note 2 used to show 4. I hve never seen a 4 bar reception on this phone.,Bad
"ITS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I GOT THE PHONE AND TO NOW I STILL DONT HAVE FULL USE OF THE DEVICE! HORRIBLE BUY! ITS NOT READING MY SIM SO I HAVE TO RESTART EVER SO OFTEN AND PROBLEM PERSISTS. NOW WHEN THE SCREEN GOES OFF THE PHONE GOES DEAD, EVEN WITH FULL CHARGE, THEN IT TAKES A WHILE FOR I CAN SWITCH IT BACK OK. WORSE WORSE WORSE BUY, I AM SO SAD AND DISAPPOINTED AND WHQT MAKES IT WORSE IS THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT! ! NOW MY GF HAS NO PHONE BECAUSE THIS ONE IS CRAP!!!!!!",Bad
"I bought the phone July 2014,It didn't work well on voice function since March 2015, when there's either incoming or outgoing call,both side cant hear the voice,unless i click on the ""speaker"" to have the speaker on, and its overheating when call is going on, there must be something wrong, other than that,the screen is big which is very good for browsing, but the voice function is not working well now,and that's the main function and purpose for having a phone,.i need to get it fixed or get a new phone,i hope there's factory after-sale service ,so far i don't know how to get this fixed.",Bad
"It's bigger than others has a bad, bad echo on calls. Hard to understand the conversation",Bad
The phone just always randomly cuts off or just goes to a white screen. People has a hard time hearing me now and i cant get 3g on it.,Bad
The phone drops calls on me a lot and I can't get any help for it.,Bad
Bought this phone as a gift. The person I gave it to had several complaints about it now working as it should. One of the many was not receiving calls for no reason. I have a S5 and I faced similar issues. I think it is time for me to try another brand.,Bad
"Well it worked fine for a couple of weeks, then it started having problems reading my Sim card....I had high hopes for this phone. But you win some, you lose some. Samsung is overrated!",Bad
"I bought two of these phones. The first one was Black and it is still in excellent condition. Then I bought a white one recently (August 2016). I exchanged the first white phone shipped to me, as it did not have a USB cover, which makes it waterproof. The second one had the USB cover, but it keeps falling open. The interior plastic or rubber part to the USB cover is defective. It will not secure. Further, it appears the other materials on the white phone are significantly inferior to those of the black phone materials. The white phone has both cheaper looking and feeling plastic or glass and metal exterior parts to the black version I received.I certainly would not risk dunking the white phone in water. So, I am not quite clear on what ""refurbished new"" means. Be cautious, certainly when purchasing the white Z3v or any ""refurbished"" product. .",Bad
"I bought this in march 2015 and about 2 months in I was having problems recharging the phone. At 3 months the charging/ data port burned out (scorch marks around the charging port), It looks like someone tried to put a cigarette out in it. Had that not happened I would have rated this a great phone however because of this the phone cannot be used.",Bad
"I can't say I hate it, but I do dislike it. This is my first smartphone and I can honestly say there are better phones out there. It dies too fast, you turn it off and you have to turn it off multiple other times to make it work right, the apps don't work good after you turn it off, and it glitches a lot. I don't recommend buying it.. Not worth it.",Bad
"the only thing separating the battery from environmental elements is a piece of plastic-like paper -UUGH!-Not described in website.. If I held it before purchasing, I surely would never have bought it. But this design does add to more access to parts, just not for my clutziness. Dropping the phone once or some other accident, I could imagine that being the end of a working phone.In addition, it is yet another phone I had to return because it could not be activated by page plus; it had an IMEI number instead of an MEID number on the back. MEID numbers are needed in order to be activated by page plus.",Bad
"The phone is nice, unfortunately the SD card interface does not work. I store all my music on the card, Whenever I play music from there, the phone will randomly lock up and reboot after some time. This happened with 2 SD cards. If you attach the phone via usb to your pc, mount the SD drive, and try copying file to it directly, it will crash too. It's a pity, no complaint otherwise.",Bad
Still has the same issues that the 6 does. Also the R1 HD. Take a photo and SOMETIMES it will let you view it. Others no viewer associated and the picture is Blank and gone forever. Reboot system and it comes out good maybe. but still loosing pictures. Not worth the money and headaches to go BLU Ever again. Searching for a different brand and hoping that it works the way it is supposed to the first time. Very disappointed.,Bad
"The phone has too many issues, ear port doesn't work correctly, camera flash weak, screen freezes up and phone shuts off and on by it self , volume low for media but rings loud.

Only had the phone 3 daysI9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.2 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROMåÊtoo many problems. Also hybrid phone case suggested with this phone does not fit.

Front facing camera has a defect. when taking pictures in a dark environment with the front facing camera there's a big blue dot.,Bad
Fast delivery for sure but I am so disappointed about the phone. I have had it for less than 2 months now and the phone's tactile screen does not work. this is quite frustrating. I can't turn it of to restart not change screens,Bad
Couldn't get connected with my Microsoft account so wasn't restoring properly. And wasn't getting text messages. Had to return for a different model.,Bad

I was sent the wrong branded phone making it unable to active on my carrier with rather poor button sensitivity.,Bad
The phone stops working sometimes. It still hangs on and does not respond to any command or key or button that you press. It is necessary to remove the battery and replacing it.4G does not work in Argentina apparently have a different frequency. No information or warnings about it at time of purchase,Bad
"Was disappointed. This phone looked great on the outside, but turns out it wouldn't hold a charge. Everytime the phone was turned off, even with full charge, it would have to be charged again to come back on. It was a Christmas present, but my son was understanding when I broke the news that I had to return it. Thank you to the seller though for processing my refund. I decided to go with a different seller and an iPhone 5 instead.",Bad
This has been a disspointment. After a few months of usage the phone is not working well and giving problems. Sometimes it boots and other it doesn't. If you buy from this seller you are risking to have the phone go bad in a few weeks.,Bad
"Back button is very difficult to press, and when I received it, the skin of the phone was already being peeled off.... And battery life is not durable, but other than those things it works fine.",Bad
"Had this phone prior to my blu life xl. This has a very delicate screen, cracked easily",Bad
The microphone has stop working after 2 months of owning the phone. Contacted blu 3 times and no reply. Don't buy the phone you will be disappointed.,Bad

"i't came whit the battery damaged, and whit other parts like the back cover im not happy with the products",Bad
When I talk on the phone it gets very hot in my hand and then after about 3 to 5 minutes it shuts down and I order a battery but I haven't got it yet. I am very disgusted with it because it gets good reception out here but what good is a cell phone if you can't talk on it.,Bad
Kids liked it. But its to small. Can't do much on it. Screen is dim. But for a 4-7 year old they liked it.... Then again having a phone is major. BTW I got it for my 11 year old.,Bad
"Have used this phone for a year, and found it a mixed bag.On the plus side it is a low enough cost that getting damaged or lost is not a huge issue. It is reasonably fast with most applications, allows for additional storage, a very good screen, a replaceable battery, and protective screen cover and case protector included at that price.On the negative side: although the camera is 13 MP, it does very poorly in anything othervthan daylight. The biggest problem is that the GPS is essentially useless. It has terrible problems finding sattelites with all GPS apps I have loaded, even given 30 minutes of clear sky. You cannot use this phone for navigation, which is a huge negative for me.I will buy something else in a mid range phone to replace it, but not another Blu.",Bad
"i bought this phone knowing that it will work, when got it home i found out that it is locked under some one else and can not be break, contacted the company and was offered to send it back and get the money back, they apologized too but this is not the way it should be1 they sold a phone that can not be used they should have checked what they have before posting it for sale.this is not ok.",Bad
"I do Like the phone. unfortunately it's not new, refurbished item. back lid doesn't even fit on the phone, it's cracked already and color doesn't match the phone either. Sure not worth $200. Need to return it.",Bad

"At first moment a great mobile phone, it worked very wel for 3 months but now has a major flaw that became a piece of junk: The Sim 1 slot is not working. I googled and discovered that many Zenfones 2 are presenting the same problem.I purchased in USA but I live in Brazil, now I have to return it in USA.PS: When it was working, it had two flaws that could be corrected on the next generation:1- The 3g and 4g only work on SIM 1 slot (SIM 2 is only for calls)2- The Battery could lasts longer (but they improved a lot since Zenfone 5-6)",Bad

"this item was way more not what was stated,am so vex now that i bought it and cant do nothing about it,its like i wase my money",Bad
Phone features are great but I received it with Chinese apps. It has English as language but no Google Play Store or a way to find English apps. It has Apps Center which gives you very specific Chinese apps options. Please be careful if you want to use it immediately this is not the phone. Not sure this is because of the seller as it has shipped from Hong Kong.UPDATE 2013/01/04Seller claimed that the phone has a good price because it comes with Chinese Apps. Offered no solution. This information is not available in product description. Please be careful and verify with the seller before you buy. You will have to find custom-built ROMs and root the phone in order to use with English and Google apps if you buy Chinese version.,Bad
"The phone itself works well. The sound quality is very good. Speed, operation, and screen quality are on par with other smart phone of this price range. Two big problems I'm having are (1) HTC own HTC Sense software is very annoying, I'd much rather use plain android OS; (2) the phone heats up in my pocket and drains the battery very quickly.HTC's support service is not very helpful. They ask you to go though ridiculous amount of diagnosis and testing on your own before letting you send it back for repair. Also be aware that they charge additional out-of-pocket fees for unlocked ""international"" phones such as this one.",Bad

This phone sucks! I thought I was purchasing a Galaxy III. This is an immitation. When I try to log onto any web sight the language is in Japanese. And I went to the settings I couldn't change it to English. Now I'm stuck with a product that was shipped to me from Hong Kong and the instructions on how to use the phone were written in German. And that's really jacked up.,Bad
I was happy with this phone until I tried to activate it. I couldn't activate it because it had an outstanding bill from T-Mobile. Pretty sloppy; they could have checked just like I did.,Bad
"It's a pretty good value for the money. Runs a late version of Android, has all the bells and whistles and is unlocked. I don't think anyone can be the value. The problem is that the screen cracked a couple weeks after purchase. The phone was not dropped or hit, just fractured screen from one corner to another. Now the touch screen does not respond well because the center of the fracture gets pressed in.",Bad
"Doesn't text right. Can't hit the e button. Not a phone for you if you text a lot. Could barely put data settings in, finally got after like 199 tries.",Bad
Didnt like the phone.wont hook up with my internet.very slow and. Very small phone.will be sending it back.cant use it.,Bad
It works very well with venezuelan operators but it has only to known lenguages: English and french. When using predective dictionary you'll have a lot of problems. The batery last longer than any other like phone. I knew about the problem with the lenguage but I did not know it would be such a problem when writing SMS's.,Bad

Was not as clear as I thought it was going to be.. If I would have known I would have just got the Kindle Fire XD for the same price. an a better look,Bad
"I bought this phone because it had pretty good reviews and I needed a new phone relatively cheap. When I first got it ran smoothly and did everything I needed it to. Now, I've had it roughly 3 months and it moves insanely slow. Whenever I tap on an app or any icon I can expect about a 5-7 second delay before said app opens. Also, the keyboard likes to crash sometimes and force close itself. I guess you get what you pay for.",Bad
"I bought this phone because I always liked the RAZR, and the phone was cute and cheap. What a mistake! The phone does not hold a charge. I talked on the phone for a little over one hour and sent a few text messages, and the battery died! It doesn't even last one whole day. Also, the phone shut off for no reason. I also could not check my email; I kept getting error messages. The phone was an AT&T phone, and even after I configured it for my carrier, it still didn't work right. I suspect this may have been a refurbished phone, even though it was advertised as ""new"". I think these phones are hit or miss. Let the buyer beware!",Bad
"It is foreign, so the plugs are european.The phone companies in the USa will tell you 'we will sell you a sim, but we guarantee nothing'Not worth the chance",Bad
"The phone arrived and the first thing that disturbed me was that I could clean the screen. The white plastic sticker paper that cover the screen in between was put on wrongly and after taking it out, I could not clean the screen. I have used alcohol but the screen is dirty. I installed viber, skpye and line and then ran out of memory to install any other program",Bad
"I got this phone because I travel often and am looking forward to using it. So far it has been functional with T-mobile network.I had to purchase the phone twice because the first one I got did not turn on. The battery would say it's charging but never charge and the power button did not work. So I sent that one back and got the exact same phone.The second one I have turns on and everything works except the volume control buttons on the side. However, seeing as I am travelling soon I will probably not get it replaced.I am assuming the problem is with the dealership not with the phone themselves. They need to do a quality check to make sure the phone is functional before they ship it out.",Bad
"It is beautiful, fast touch screen, very nice, it's a ""Cellpad"". The only difference between a iPhone and this HTC is the warranty. I have a lot of things that is from apple. The warranty/customer support made the difference. Apple just replace without putting you on the ""bandit"" side. Warranty from HTC is not international, have a lot of ""Limitations"". I have mine one for almost an year and it does not connect to the computer through the cable (they said it's the hardware). That's it.",Bad
Well it kept freezing and locking up...then all of a sudden half of the phone dont work...its like half of it got damaged and it was just sitting on the table...idk all i know is im not happy about spending 400+ dollars for it to work only a couple weeks,Bad

"I got issues with the carrier which was meant to delivery the product in Venezuela (my home). Bizglobal is the carrier's name, they never gave me a answer about the product, it seems to be lost. I wait a lot, six months, hoping that the carrier bring my package. But now knowing that all this time passed without an answers via email or phone I realized that that is not going to happen. I am really sad about that.",Bad
"I really feel cheated with this product! I supposed to buy a new phone but did not! is REFURBISHED! Phone out is very good! actually that looks back to 100%, display, keyboard and trackpad are new but inside is USED, please if you offer a new product, do it for real! the phone apparently was new but has more than 35 hours of use!",Bad
The WiFi isn't working properly.It keeps disconnecting every 10 min and takes time to connect again.This is quite frustrating.The gaming experience is OK and the slide is hanging loose and looks like it might break anytime.,Bad
"It's cute, but the screen protector traps all kinds of dust/pet hair, scratches easily, & leaves a pocket of air that really reduces the sensitivity of the touch screen. The edges of the box also make it very very difficult to use the edges of the touch screen (trying to scroll through contacts, or text the number 1, for example.)",Bad
the phone has been tempered with and was not written the review but i ordered for the phone in the first place,Bad
"This phone is international phone but not USA phone. I thought it was sell in USA; However, it is ship from China. The ac charger is too big too fix in USA plug. The phone is color gray but the ac adaptor is white. I does not have 4 G for my Tmobile , so it is very slow connection for online.",Bad
My honest review is: This company sent me 2 a white and a gold. They didnt even have the same operating system. The gold mustve been updated. The white had no back button or tools button. Had to click main button and start over just to get back into settings menu. Yeah that had to go back. Gold one was fine but it would freeze every now and again and you have to remove battery and shut it off. That was a pain and not worth the headache even for cheap. Oh and the camera that I thought was supposed to be 2mp wasnt even VGA 640x480. It was only svga 320x240 max size and even then the picture was so unbearable that you couldnt post it to social media at all. was of time. Really. I gave it 2 stars because im giving 1 star to each of the 2 i brought and returned. Save your money. For the record im not blaming amazon. Im blaming Pandaoo for the product. Other than that the notifications work ok with app. Just physical watch mechanics that is horrible.,Bad
"It works. It's terrible. There are, like, 120mb of free data. I spent $40 on a phone, I'm clearly not trying to pay extra for more space.Android 4.0 is WAAY older than I thought.No 4g.",Bad
"I find this phone to be difficult to work with. First, the touch sensitivity is poor. I find I frequently need to touch things twice to make them work. The screen needs to be unlocked with a swipe...many times I have to swipe twice. I like the push and hold method better. Second, the navigation is terrible. It is difficult to see how to exit from certain function such as messaging, contact lists or the phone pad. Finding settings is difficult too..still can't find the auto-word-complete for sending messages. Beware signing up an existing Gmail account. It totally loads the entire gmail contact list and mixes it in with your phone list. Suddenly, you might have hundreds of contact names. I tried to delete the GMAIL account, but it require an entire phone reset.My other phone is an iPhone, which I find to be superior, so, I've obviously experience a higher standard.",Bad
"Nice phone. My daughter loves it. Seems pretty durable. It even has great features.Sadly, as my daughter's last Blu phone ..... the SIM adapter is horribly designed. You must use an adapter for a nano SIM cards. The card will not fit nicely. It will take several attempts.We ended up destroying the SIM slot by having to re-insert the SIM card so many times.",Bad
"This was a great phone back when I had it when it was current, however we purchased two of these, and some 8-12 months later they have become quite laggy all the time for no apparent reason. Tried cleaning up bloatware and a few other things, but nothing seems to be causing the problem or able to fix it. Not sure what the issue is with it. It was a really nice phone for the first part of it, and has a nice big and clear display, however, and still functions ""okay"" some of the time, just occasionally you will be sitting waiting some 10-20 seconds out of nowhere, even when doing very light tasks on it.",Bad
The phone would not accept a SIM card for the carrier and couldn't be programmed.,Bad
"I spent a long time deciding whether or not to get a replacement phone for my galaxy s3 and I was so excited to receive this in the mail, new and unflawed. I was able to set up everything via wifi with my google account, social media accounts, email, and even pokemon go... until i realized that I was unable to send text messages or make calls with my sim card in. I called the AT&T tech center but they didn't answer. I went to the AT&T device tech support store this morning and was there for hours. They tried everything and were unable to activate the phone. I am actually really upset and frustrated that I have to return this device for a refund. I already bought a case for this model as well but now I am unsure if it's worth purchasing it again. Wi-Fi works great, but that's not the point of having a smart phone. **I bought this from seller Amazon Warehouse Deals**",Bad
"I bought this as a last resort as I had broken a phone and needed a quick replacement. I believe people like me were the niche for this product - desperate customer looking for a quick fix. This phone has very limited capabilities in its initial version. Once you've updated it, the phone SLOWS DOWN IMMENSELY. I've had my phone freeze and drop in the middle of a call with someone. This phone is outdated or refurbished or something, in any case it is NOT WORTH $230. Invest a few more $100 into an actual working phone.",Bad
"I like the phone , it just that this one is defective. The n and the i doesn't work properly. You have to push them several times to get them to work.",Bad
"IT'S NOT REALLY THE PHONE I THINK IT'S NOT THE GOOD ONE. i CAN NOT COMPARE THAT PHONE WITH SAMSUN GALAXY IT'S LIKE AN iPad BUT IT' S NOT, SOON IT GONNA PUT ME IN TROUBLE",Bad

"I purchased this phone for a number of reasons unfortunately my desires are not being met.The battery life is so poor that it lasts only about 6 hours after full charging.

"I really like this phone everything about this is great it runs fast is the best ZTE phone I've ever had. But about 1 week after use, only one of the two speakers work and I'm really disappointed this phone used to have such great sound and now is terrible, I wish I could contact them and have them send me a new pjone",Bad
Phone would not allow any kind of download. checked with T-Mobile and they informed me that the phone had a manufacturers defect. I returned the phone and have not received a replacement yet.,Bad
"Was not expecting a lot out of the phon, But just the speaker is really bad. It is really hard to hear anything or understand what people are trying to say.",Bad
"The pick-up range was very bad, setting alarm was very time consuming,was not able to get the ring tone I wanted.It is built tough and I will keep it as a back up phone.If the phone had a good external antenna it would greatly improve the range and you would lose less calls.",Bad
"I was expecting that company with the name in mobile business will treat its flagship product with proper attention. Especially when the sales are poor and company loses money every month.I was wrong.Not only the OS is half-baked, no useful programs, no maps of my region, no even descent music player. In addition, the phone reboots itself for no reason, 2-3 times a day, no matter what I do.That is super-annoying.Having said that, I admit that I like the overall idea of WP8, but honestly, implementation is horrible.To whom I would recommend this? I dont know, maybe to my family's enemy or to some crazy microsoft lover/Nokia geek, so he/she could spend days and nights setting up and rebooting this useless piece of hardware...I dont know. Seriously, with all this hype around Windows Phone platform, and how it is so much better then other competitors - why is the flagship hardware, backed by 2 super corporations, is so buggy, unreliable, useless? How come?",Bad
Phone came in unused condition and fired up fine but when going to activate it to our already existing verizon plan as a replacement phone it was not recognized and could not be activated.,Bad
Very nice phone if it would charge. Unfortunately it would not charge at all. I tried several things including a new charger and cable. I guess it must have had a bad battery or charging port. I had to send it back.,Bad
There are some scratches on screen and the phone's back. I do not think it's new at all.,Bad
"I bought this phone and received it Tuesday. It has quite a few chipped places that I didn't expect it would have, but a case covers it. Read the description of the phone well before you buy. I bought the unlocked international phone and didn't know that it was Verizon and would give me so much trouble trying to use with Straight Talk. After spending $200+ I now get to purchase a $40 activation kit even though I've been using straight talk flawlessly for 4 years. I will update if and when I am able to use this phone.",Bad
Had to buy a SIM card and have to buy a memory card just to take pictures and to go onto social media site.,Bad
"I wish I had believed the reviews. This phone worked good for one day then froze up. This phone is listed as ""NEW"" and wasn't. I did return the phone for a full refund.",Bad
Phone was great except they gave me a bad battery. The battery drained really fast and I wasnt even doing anything on it. At first I thought it was just cause I was trying to set everything up on it but then after I charged it all night it I checked my phone and its battery was just going Down for no reason had nothing running but I could just sit there and watch it drain. So I returned it. But over all great phone,Bad

"I loved this phone when I got it. But it hasn't even been a month and the phone started having major problems. When watching videos the volume just disappears, also it started acting as if the phone was on silent when it wasn't.

"I bought this phone (htc 7 sorround) about a month ago. The phone was broken, when I turned on the screen was frozen (white screen) and never passed that level.. Sorry, but my advice is do not trust this seller... certainly they do not test the phone before sending it..Nando",Bad
"this phone has its good days and its bad days. It shuts off randomly while i'm browsing the web or replying to message and it'll do it 2 or 3 more times after i turn it back on. Battery doesn't last too long when browsing and The battery can go from 20% to fully charged in a matter of seconds when plugged in so i never really know how long my battery will last, or much it has charged. also the touch screen is glitchy when it's plugged in and it's very hard to type or scroll, sometimes i'd rather just unplug it to type a message then plug it back in. but on other days the phone works perfectly fine, battery will last all day regardless of browsing and i have no problems with it? the seller said it was new, but i really don't think it is...kind of sketchy. hope this helps.",Bad
It does the job for the most part. party failed to mention that the phone already had water damage and does not always ring when someone calls you...,Bad
"Three weeks and the battery will not last more than 10 hours, ON STANDBY!!!! Phone is okay for a basic 3g phone that we are being forced into, but the battery stinks!",Bad
After 3 months of usage. I am facing quite a big draw back on the performance.Any application takes more than a minute to open and the phones seems to have slowed down considerably.Not a good buy,Bad
"The phone itself is very good. its well built and looks great. Performance is great. Battery life is average, lasts about a day on a normal to heavy use. My only issue with the phone is that it does not perform well T-Mobile 4G. You will not get 4g speed as the band is not supported. Also its a little pricey considering how old is this model. There are a lot of other models available in $300-$400 range which are only 6-12 month old and are far more superior.I would have given it a 3 stars but I am taking down one star due to incorrect description. Android 4.2.2 is not a Kitkat version, its still jellybean. I should have paid more attention before buying this phone.",Bad
"The phone overall is decent. A lot of people that reviewed the phone claim they can get several hours off of one charge. I on the other hand (I've had it a little less than a year now) can only get about 5 hours with moderate use. I usually end up charging the phone twice a day. And this has been the case ever since I got it. Picture quality is definitely great but nowadays the cameras that are coming out, you can get about the same quality. Bottom line, dont get this phone. What's the point of having an amazing camera when its battery will be low all the time?",Bad
"Something was up with the MicroSim card slot. It would not fit a microsim so either the sim converter was wrong or it was the phone. My nano sim was too small and the microsim was too big. It did have a regular size sim card slot and that worked however, This phone would not accept the Project Fi Data Only sim. This is the reason I had to return it. I planned to use the phone for Uber and only needed data but it wouldnt recognize the sim. Also the phone is a bit too big for uber. Even with a CD or A/C mount. I think a 6"" sceen phone or 5.5"" would be ideal for uber. This thing is just too massive to be a phone and too small to be a tablet.",Bad
"How can the battery be charged itself, it is loosing power after short time, almost 24 hours after it should be recharged again. Please advise.",Bad
I was really excited about this case and loved the color but was really disappointed after the first couple days. The gray parts of the case started picking up dark pigments from my purses and pockets. Literally only a few days after I was so upset that I ordered a new one. It's too bad because otherwise the case would've been great.,Bad
"Good for what it is. It is a 2G only phone, so if your carrier uses 3G for MMS, Internet, etc. you are out of luck for any of that stuff. Has a decent camera for a feature phone. FM radio reception is marginal at best.",Bad
All I wanted was an explanation why this does not work? x xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xx xx xxxx xx xxx xx,Bad
"I bought my phone a week ago. Today the device was deleting contact info so I shut it down, now it will not start back up.",Bad
"Very disappointed with this phone, for having Gorilla Glass it shattered pretty easily with a case on it. Would not recommend wasting that much money on this phone when there are other brands with similar specs for a bit cheaper. The phone performance overall isn't anything spectacular, lots of little things that just don't make this phone worth it overall.",Bad
"Within a few days , gallery crashed. I reset the phone, worked for a few days, then it crashed again.This phone is a hot mess.Told my siblings do not buy please, please.",Bad
"Purchased used phone advertised as ""like new"". Although phone arrived in original packaging and all external appearances Iwere as advertised, the phone receiver volume is so low that it is for all practical purposes unusable. Diagnostic at Apple Store resulted in conclusion that the internal receiver speaker was defective and not repairable. No warranty. Apple offered to exchange for $199, or suggested that I consult my carrier. In the end I have a killer music device but for a phone it, it is about useless. Caveat emptor.",Bad
This phone was great at first but now that I've had it for a couple weeks it is extremely slow. It freezes all the time. It is absolutely garbage. Even with an SD card to store stuff.,Bad
"We bought this phone as a gift for a family member. In less than a year (without the phone having sustained any kind of damage from being dropped, getting wet, etc) the screen had become completely unresponsive. Despite many conversations with customer service, nothing was done to replace or fix the phone.Maybe we just got unlucky on this one, but in replacing the phone we certainly didn't look to LG and wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone based on our experience.",Bad
"The phone works with AT&T, but the data doesn't. Not sure what to do with it now.I like the stylus and the dual sim, but if it is not fully functional, I guess it is useless.",Bad
"The devices was in good cosmetic shape, but the battery drains pretty fast and the internal camera does not work.",Bad
"I had to send it back, ;( Boo! I plugged in the phone for about an hour or so, once I turned the phone on and began downloading all my previous apps, it became very very hot. I've had this phone before, about 3 times to be exact, and I LOVE IT. The memory is awesome and, honestly, it is better than some of those new phones on the market. I didn't even want the updated version of this phone, because this one is SO AWESOME!!! Any who, it may have been that I just happen to get a faulty phone, otherwise, you know it'd be like 20 STARS!!!",Bad
"Was working great and setup on PagePlus was a snap. I went through the setup of my accounts and other personalizations when it asked me to update the software. Great! The device did its thing and was updated. A few hours later, another software update was needed, downloaded....and then the device goes into a black screen with tiny white lettering and an error message. Unable to recover from that. Attempted to do some research on online forums and it seems it is a consistent problems with that version of the software update for android on the droid 2. Was able to return with not much fuss. I think I'll steer clear of the Droid 2 from now on.",Bad
"The only good part was that it came with a charger. The battery life sucks, its an older model phone so I can't get a new battery through Sprint. It constantly cuts off whenever itwants I am disappointed",Bad
"For some odd reason, I am unable to send picture messages. I can send FB, Messenger, ect. just not in a text..otherwise, I love it!",Bad
One of the phones have a bad charger port. I want to send it back,Bad
Love that it had a pull out keyboard but the battery didn't last long after a few months and it started having issued after the few months of use.,Bad
The phone is good only for talking. No applications or games work on it. All keep asking for a smart chip...waste of money,Bad
Its cheap but the back kept falling off and I had to use tape to keep it together,Bad
"At first I loved it. Exactly 3 months later, the phone is dead in the water and won't charge. Too late to return",Bad
Wasn't in the box it showed & the battery doesn't hold a charge very long.,Bad
"This phone is the perfect size but the camera is terrible. It doesn't receive MMS messages, I have tried everything ! I wouldn't recommend this phone.",Bad
"I am extremely dissapointed and would not suggest this seller to anyone. The phone came not in the original packaging, it has had it's screen changed, so at&t logo wouldn't show up. There is a missing bolt on the bottom (only an empty slot left, where on the other side it's ok). The screen protector is on, but it has been changed and is not the original one, because I kno how lumia phones come when they are new. All the side stickers have been removed and there are scratches on the sim slot, because it probably has been used. There is a scratch on the back of the phone as well. AND it doesn't even turn on, is just stuck on the empty battery screen. I'm just very mad right now. Exchanging it.",Bad
"Seems good value for the price, I am unable to say whether its a great phone or not, it had a few glitches and I returned it.",Bad
"It constantly shuts down apps my sim card doesn't fit in it, you need full sized sim card for this phone",Bad
"Purchased this phone for my Dad for Christmas. He's a Blackberry fanatic! Sadly, after 3 days of charging the phone the battery still was unable to go past the 30% mark without any use at all. No SIM inserted. No phone calls. No wifi used at all. And still the battery won't take a charge. Returning it with a heavy heart.",Bad
I don't like this phone because it was very basic. Small screen display and small text. I would not recommend this phone.,Bad
"I have had this for a couple of months now. It freezes all the time. Most of the apps on this phone is a mess. I had to call my network service provider several times blaming it on them, only to released it the phone. Most recommended solution is to turn the Phone off and on. It sucks imagine you are in the middle of an important issue. Though the price is okay , it doesn't worth buying it. I will advice you add a few dollars to buy something else.",Bad
"I am honestly not pleased, I purchased this phone because I taught memory card can be used I Even ask and I was told yes now i have a phone with only 32 memory space. Kmt I am so disappointed honestly, the phone is only pretty i made a mistake when I purchased this phone.",Bad
"I bought my phone in January 2012. It worked well for the next 10 months. Since then, I have had to have the buttons cleaned several times. After talking on a call I can't hang up. I'm losing money by added time going to the phone company because I can't hang up. I can't transfer from different topics on the menu without getting frustrated. Whenever I sync my phone and laptop the time always needs to be reset. This is very annoying. I'm now looking for a phone without buttons - only touch screen. Maybe Samsung.",Bad
"First HTC 610 worked perfectly, but this one is out to the factory for repair. Will update when unit is returned.",Bad
"Well, I will first say that when I bought this phone I was very excited bit the more I use it the more I dislike it. I like the fact it has a big screen but it freezes time to time. It doesn't hold a charge like it was suppose to but over all I like the phone.",Bad
"Battery is so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Taking it off the charger at 8am, it's down below 20% by 2pm and today was my day off (very limited use). Without the ability to switch out the batteries (very poor decision Samsung), it greatly limited the effectiveness of this phone. Come on Samsung,get your program together. Add the removable battery back into your flagship phone for power users! (I would have given this a 1star but the rest of the phone is pretty great).",Bad
I love samsung but this is AT&T phone but tmobile compatible. Alot of features cant be used. I use it only for talk/text. My internet is used on my tablet since I dont have AT&T service to cell.,Bad
"This phone is not strong enough. The phone I wanted to replace is a 16GB. I don't live in the United States and purchased the phone to pick up while I was on vacation in the U.S. Could not get all my Aps and info on the phone so had to go back to using the old phone. I will use this phone when I'm in the United States about 5 weeks a year and I'll make sure I don't have many aps on it. Sorry I bought it but it was my fault, not anything wrong with the phone. When I return to the U.S. I'll be sure to purchase either 16GB or higher.",Bad
I just got mi phone over a week ago done freezing when tape videos not clear in sound wen send voice note it empty at time,Bad
The phone never turned on... some type of electrical glitch. Very disappointed. Returned it promptly.,Bad
"was handy little gadget for $40. connecting via bluetooth was simple enough if youre familiar with bluetooth devices. The speaker was surprisingly loud and quality was decent.The touch screen was a bit difdicult to use as it needed a heavier solid touch/swipe. Most of the ""apps"" built in worked fine, except that the clock did not sync with the phone and had to be set manually, and the pwdometer which was complete garbage. it would add steps sitting on a shelf. the bluetooth range was steong up to 10 feet and decent up to about 20 with few issues. the real failing in the end was that after a week the usb port died and it would not recharge or even send music through the headphone adaptor. I retirned it and instead decided to try an android smartwatch option and much preferred it.",Bad
"This is advertised as an unlocked phone that will work on any GSM network. That isn't true. I can make calls and send texts on AT&T's network, but it will not send or receive data over celluar. Data works when connected to WiFi. The phone is basically crippled.When it works on WiFi, it is amazing. Windows Phone is better than iPhone or Android. Just beware of the limitations of buying this T-Mobile model that starts in German and only has instructions in German.",Bad
"I liked the idea to have a cell phone always with me ... as a watch... but the technology is not yet enough advanced ... the watch cell phone is too big vs usual watches and looks ugly ... it's not convenient to answer calls ... everybody can listen what another caller is talking to you ... sales of such watch cell phones should be accompanied by free earphones that may improve sales but anyway it's not a solution ... it may seem as fantastic idea but directed voicing, so nobody except you can listen another caller, will help to promote the idea with watch cell phones ...",Bad

"Please allow to clarify that the one star is because the incomplete and non-real info related to the cellphone description.They never mention that is a Mid-East brand, which would never be able to connect to the FCC modules from America, in other words: I CANNOT CONNECT TO LTE OR 4G SERVICES BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN AMERICAN BRAND CELLPHONE.I'm really mad, despite the product came in excellent conditions and it is a great brand.I cannot explode it to the maximum performance because of this...I would take my considerations if the description of the product was the correct.",Bad
I thought it be easy to operate. I can't do anything on it. I was looking for something to write my journal into. I could keep track of my calories.I could put it into my purse and all things to my journal. I need to start a journal.,Bad
"At first i really liked the phone and although frustrating to learn a new IOS, (I was an iPhone user), it seemed to be a nice phone on day 1. Then i realized it drains the battery ultra fast, then I couldn't get the settings to where the screen wouldn't go haywire every time I was texting. Then the worst - the charger port pin bent and it won't take a charge. I've had to purchase a spare battery charger for now and contacting the seller has proven to be WORTHLESS! I filed a claim to return it and also sent the seller and email to make sure they saw the request and they basically said ""since you filed a claim I won't help you!"". Now all I want is to know where to order the charger port and instructions of how to do it (since it's a clone, some cell phone repair places will not work on it). The seller has yet to help me and I have no idea how to contact the manufacturer directly!I guess i'll be paying more $$ for a replacement since the seller won't stand behind the product.",Bad
"I bought this phone for my mom and while it worked well, now after two months the battery DIES very quickly. I am very disappointed as the warranty expired. Unlike other phones, changing the battery is a laborious process. Buyer beware what you are getting.",Bad

It has a small manufacturing defect where you enter the SIM, has a protruding plastic to be lifted in order to enter it.",Bad

"I had one of these phones new and after two years, the Wi-Fi just stopped working with no way to repair it. So I had to ""upgrade"" to the iPhone 5. Unfortunately, it fell out of my pocket from quite a height while I was still paying for it on Sprint's new framily plan which means no contract. That iphone 5 was pretty good, probably 4 stars, but it had to be replaced. So I bought this refurbished iPhone 4 and it is a piece of crap. Weird stuff happens all of the time while I'm using it, like different screens popping up out of no where, or apps just starting up when I haven't even touched the phone. But, the game Apple plays with their phones mysteriously stopping working when it's due for an upgrade is one I have to play, unfortunately.",Bad
"This product is not big enough, but we have a durability problem as we shipped it together with Class C.",Bad
"This phone only lasted 9 months. When I contacted the seller all they could say to me was - ""Unfortunately our phones are used and don't come with any warranty, just a 30 day money back return policy. Unfortunately the time frame has passed. My apologies."" I guess you get what you pay for. The entire audio portion of the phone died. All you could hear was crackle noise until it got to the point that you heard nothing. Doesn't give me a lot of confidence in ""This device has been extensively tested, is fully functional, and ready for activation.""",Bad

So far I have had two of these. And so far both phones have lasted about a month to a month and a half before the touch screen stops working and ive had to order a replacement.

"Phone I got was REALLY slow and laggy! I hate it compared to the BLU Studio 5.0C HD Quad Core I purchased last year! That phone rocked!! Thought I was buying the same one again, as that what seller showed in photos; however, that is NOT what arrived!",Bad
I ordered this phone to replace one that my teen aged son had broken. I really like the more rugged design of this phone but the seller included a charger with the phone that was a piece of junk. The charger that was sent with the unit looked to be a cheap travel charger that wasn't made for the phone. When plugging it in it wouldn't transfer a charge to the battery. After spending another 30 bucks on a charger that would work the phone now works great. Be mindful if you order a phone from this company to check and make sure that the charger they include with the phone actually works.,Bad
"Well guys , sorry but the phone does not work, first the battery is not good, second the SIM card reader does not work either, sorry guys ,I really disappointed",Bad
"This is the second time I ordered this item, per amozon, they suggest I return it and reorder this item. I did not contain the cade, car charger, cd and other items that were suppose to come with this phone. So be awaer it does not contain the accessories.",Bad
Came slowly 7 days. But seems to work. Phone was Cingular but working fine with att go phone sim. Decent shape for the age of the phone and made my finance happy. Would have rated a five if I could have selected faster shipping \ been prime eligible\ Anyways seems to be work the 26 bucks. Mind you its only been in use today. Oh ya and came with charger and charged a plus. This phone takes the old style USB you know the phat one......... So have down graded my review because after 2 days of use the battery life was very noticeably limited to two hours or less. The phone now will not hold a charge at all. Granted a new battery on amazon is around. 5 dollars. Low and behold this phone lasted around two weeks even the charger died. I believe that it was wet a one point further inspection the battery was new not original and the little water sticker is missing. Battery is fine long as charge in a different phone. Wouldn't buy from passport again.,Bad
Excellent phone but somehow it seems as if the phone has been sitting their for a while not even six days with the phone and the screen cracks and keeps cracking all over even though i had a tempered glass on it. The LCD is fine but the screen is horrible. At least for me.,Bad

"Ordering this I knew it wasn't in pristine condition, but this was still a huge let-down. When it arrived it was scratched and worn all over (this I expected), and had dirt/dust stuck in every crevice (that was unexpected). The charger was worn and nearly broken at the end. It worked alright for a few weeks, didn't hold much charge, but that is understandable for a used battery. It would occasionally freeze and require restarting, and the screen sometimes didn't load properly. After a few weeks it wouldn't charge at all. I tried an old charger that fit, and while it turned on one last time, it was barely functional, and completely gave up on me later that day.I knew I couldn't expect much from a used phone, but this was still a let down and ended up being a waste of money.",Bad

"Being a Blackberry user for 5 years, I did want to like the new Classic Blackberry. It has a nice interface, good screen, and fantastic keyboard. However, there was a 2 major flaws with the battery on my phone which is why I am giving the phone only 2 stars. First, on my unit, once you power the unit off, it will NOT power back on until its connected to a power source i.e. pressing the top power button does not turn it on. Second, the battery barely makes it through half a day. Having seen the other reviews, I am guessing I may have a faulty device so am returning my phone and have ordered a new one from Amazon. Am hoping that the new device will be better. Also called Blackberry support, and they were willing to do a warranty exchange on the phone but returning is to Amazon is easier. However, am really disappointed at the quality control or rather lack of quality control with these new phones, and am hoping the new phone will be better.",Bad

I am a lil disappointed because she really liked this phone and the color was just perfect....SORRY!!!,Bad
"I believe this phone was replaced by its original owner not only for an upgrade , but because of the glitches,, the phone is definitely not in perfect working conditions,. The screen doesn't even rotate to landscape consistently. I guess not wanting to search for another iPhone is the only reason I haven't tried to send it back, as well as my recent denial for a money back ""guarantee"",. With eBay. My online shopping experiences seem to not be so great",Bad
"I am disappointed in the battery life of this phone. The last Casio G'zOne I owned had a much longer lasting battery, even after using it for 2 1/2 years. I have to charge this one every day and then it still sometimes dies during the day. I think the battery is bad.And now the trim ring on the front fell off. It was just stuck on with double back adhesive. I think it's too late to send it back or I would do just that.",Bad
This was much flimsier than I was expecting. Definitely wish I would have just gone with the otterbox commuter wallet.,Bad
"There was half an hour or more getting this on my line because wear and tear removed the numbers. The battery wouldn't charge. I FINALLY got it connected with the patience and expertise of the Verizon clerk and I bought a new battery. With the new battery it works better. It would be nice if sellers of older phones would spend the $5 to get a new battery before they sell the old phone. They might even get a few dollars more for the phone if they added ""brand new battery"" to the ad because we would know we didn't have to buy one.",Bad
"The phone was clearly labeled as UNLOCKED. That's why I bought it. Only to discover it was LOCKED to T-Mobile. I eventually got it unlocked 2 weeks and $25 later, but I was disappointed in the deception. Other than that, the phone is a decent one.",Bad
"Buyer beware, through my own experience & things I've read, many things can be passed off as new when they're not, and this model phone doesn't do well when the firmware is forced on there. This site has no way of tracking ESN's or verifying if the seller has an accurate description before it's sold. One can, google swappa. Again, if new, this phone is great, but if not, don't buy it, spring for a higher model that can work as a refurb.",Bad
"nice looking and handy phone, but after a day or two it just gets super slow. Every app you open takes forever to work and function, taking pictures takes forever etc. and picture quality is horribleNo problems with writing messages and calling, but since it is a smartphone you expect to be able to do a liiittle more with it than just call and text. It's just a pain. I wouldn't get it again, it's worth spending a little more money on a phone that won't make you wanna throw it on the wall just because it keeps freezing and taking forever to load or open apps",Bad
"The microphone is not working after 3 months, but when I turn on the speaker it is working again.I reset the phone and the mic work for like 1 day and then fail again.What is the problem? I want to return it and get it refund.",Bad
It was an issue getting it to respond to the server of t mobile. The phone is glitchy and memos keep poping up saying something is wrong with it. plus its not insured by my company so i have to find an alternative source to insure it to fix it.i would return it but its been a while since i got it.,Bad

"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",Bad
"I bought a BLU that is supposed to be 4G, but it turns out to be 3G only. The phone is ok but the data runs slowly and in many occasions, the signal is very poor.",Bad
"This phone shuts down often in the middle of my correspondence, or when I am viewing a page. Also, Ihave not been able to send or receive pictures in my messages. I would simply like to trade it for another phone.",Bad
"I love the phone, but the seller didn't specify that the manual is in some other language, I dont know if it is japanese or chinese or what. WTH I don't understand anything it says",Bad
"The pros for this phone speak for themselves and are what seduced me into excitedly ordering it. I was in disbelief. Turns out, it was too good to be true.I LOVED that it had dual sim. Well, dual sim apparently doesn't mean dual the antenna power, because anytime I engaged dual sim mode I had TERRIBLE reception on both sims.Very weak bluetooth connection, to the point that I could only use it for music but not for talking.It's wifi wasn't nearly as good as the 3 year old beat up iPhone 5 that this phone was replacing.Occasionally (4 times in a week) I would get an incoming call, answer, and just hear myself echoing back. My caller (on the subsequent call) said he had the same thing on his end (his own voice echoing). Can't be sure it is this phone's fault, but, hasn't happened before or after so I think it is.I returned mine.",Bad
"The Phone is dead. When i start it it switches off immedietly.The phone had some issues when i got it 3 months ago - like the WiFi would not connect, but then i kept it because i loved the wake up alarm. But now it has gone dead in 3 months.To add to it, the Nokia warranty guys are not returning calls or emails. They had me fill out a warranty replacement form and said some one would get back, but it has been 2 weeks and no news.I would recommend everyone to stay away from this phone and possibly Nokia too.",Bad
"Well, the listing showed a New ""Black"" ! The iPhone is as ""White"" as ""Sunlight"" plus, Verizon could ""NOT"" get the phone to work on the ""DATA"" System for the Internet! I was told it had an Insurance Claim from 2 Sources!The iPhone was new as stated. This was the only truthful part of the information describing the Apple Zebra Cellular Phone.I had to purchase a new phone from Verizone with a 2 yr. contract, & it works.Just my luck !",Bad
when I shook it i could hear some sound coming form inside of the phone like something was broken... when I received calls the sound was not at all clear...it came in a box which was supposed to be of a yellow lumia 920.... the original charger of nokia was not included.. some cheap white charger was there... (original is black),Bad

"well after I finally decided to upgrade from my HTC Inspire to this phone. I was excited, it worked for the first day, then I decided to put on the vonage it just kept freezing and shutting down so had to reset or take the battery out. the camera was not what I expected.

"The phone had a crack. On the back that was not listed on the description. It did say normal wear and tear, but I think a crack is more than normal when you pay that much for a used phone, you expect the truth.",Bad
"I bought this phone for my mom to use in another country. She said the phone turns off all the time for no reason and sometimes the phone gets very hot and she has to turn off because she is scared that the phone might explode. I would return the phone, but she is too far away and shipment costs would be too high.",Bad
It came with problems on battery and charger. I live abroad so I have to bought other battery in my country.The battery was turns off with 40% and the charger had a weird noise.,Bad
Had this less than a month and it wouldn't let me open my apps or type anything.,Bad
Good for the price but. The phone would sometimes register a tap on the other side of the screen from where I tapped. And it had very poor viewing angles,Bad
I wasn't aware that I couldn't get the 4G service in my area and the talking/ sound quality is not good.,Bad
Nice little phone but keys are too small which would make it hard to use. Not much different than my old gusto phone.,Bad
"I loved this phone until updating to Nougat and it turned off randomly and got stuck in a boot loop. It was under warranty, so I shipped it to LG. They received it 20+ days ago. They've deemed it repairable so they won't replace it. But, they don't have the parts to repair it and don't know when that part will be back in stock and so my phone just sits in a warehouse. So, if you want this or another Nexus phone, I would recommend buying it from Google and having their warranty service instead of LG's, which doesn't seem to be so concerned with customer satisfaction.",Bad
"I loved many features about this phone, but the one thing that doesn't work is multi media messaging. My grandma cannot receive images via text. That was very important to her so we can't use it. I'm on the search for a phone that has the same qualities. Big buttons, non-flip cause she lacks the dexterity to answer before hang up, pictures of her main contacts so she can make a call by just hitting a photo pic, but it has to be able to receive photos via text and archive those photos.",Bad
i bought because in the page said that it works with 4g in argentina. that is false.,Bad
"Why did Otterbox change the Defender design from the covered home button on the 4s to one on the 5s in which the slightest moisture on a finger seeps under the clear screen protector thru the unprotected home button? I work in a very hot & dusty environment where my hands get wet from condensation on drink/ water bottles. I didn't used to have to worry, cause my iPhone was fully protected. Not with this design change. Otterbox makes a fine product, but perhaps they need to change the name when they change the design. I will need to get a new case now, because this ""hole"" defeats its ability to PROTECT. Otterbox should try to poll the previous users to see what's most needed. ""Weak links"" seem to keep happening.",Bad
The phone looks great but the home button does not work. I immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. I was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. I am not satisfied with the seller at all.,Bad
"REALY I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING BETTER , IT DOESN'T WORTH THE $ 610 I PAID , THE BATTERY IS HORRIBLE , I HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY , I HAD THE 9780 AND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER , REALY IT DOES'T WORTH TO CHANGE FROM THE 9780 TO THIS PHONE .I REALY REGRET BUYING THIS BLACKBERRY MODEL",Bad
"Pro: Great screen, fast processor, good memory. This phone punches well outside it's weight class performance wise.Con: I'm getting real tired of phones designed to look sleek without a single thought for ergonomics. The finish is slippery, the edges are sharp, the back isn't rounded, and it's just slightly to big to use one handed without being a faux-tablet necessitating two hands.P.S. The ergonomically best smartphone I've found is the motorola moto-e.",Bad
2 stars because I ordered 2 from the same seller and one phone stopped working a week after. Unable to return because I was out for vacation.... So money wasted,Bad
i have been using this phone for a few months and just dont like it at all. THis is not a quality phone. the camera is not very good at all despite being 13 MP. the screen is extremely slow when typing it can NEVER catch up even if i go slow it doesnt respond right.,Bad
Pros :1) Low in price2) Good HD in vidoesCons:1) Poor and horrible in camera pictures both front and back end camera. Image is not clear.2) Heating,Bad
Ask if the phone worked in Venezuela with Digitel with 4G and they said yes and it does not work with 4G !!,Bad
We got this phone for Christmas. Now is end of the January and battery on phone is gone. It does not go for a full day without charging it. it was doing ok for about a month. We did all that a book said to preserve a battery. no help.,Bad
I just bought the phone and the language is in Chinese or Tai. I've tried to change it to English. I will have to return it if I can't figure how to change the language,Bad
"Great for basics,call quality is crystal,texting is okay,but for entertainment purposesand apps its downright awful it loads apps really slowly ,youtube takes forever and this version of android is ancient but tolerable.",Bad
"The battery doesn't last a full 8 hours without needing to be charged, but the phone was in good shape.",Bad
Its a good phone but i ask a lg f400 and they gave me a lg d851 of tmobile...wtf?,Bad
"The phone itself is okay. Performance it is pretty snippy.I use it for travel and it does what I need it to do.However, it is probably the most fragile phone I've ever seen.The screen cracked from the home screen button from heat general use.I set the phone down onto my desk and I did not slowly place it down, but dropped it from a few inches. When I picked it up the whole screen was spiderweb cracked. I've had this phone for about 40 days.This will be the last BLU purchase I'll make.",Bad
"It is ok, it does what I need it to do and that's the main thing",Bad
"This phone is not ATT compatible! When I went to the store to switch it out the ATT SIM card does not fit this phone. The contacts can't be transferred. The Customer Rep had to make me a new SIM card to replace the one that came with the phone. I get the phone home and the Voicemail function does not work. Reading the instructions to go to ""Voicemail Tutorial"" when I get that far it requires a name and address to access the tutorial. Well, what name? what address? Not my own because the selection doesn't allow it. The SPEAKER ON/OFF button is backwards! And it defaults to SPEAKER ON when incoming calls come in. I do not like this phone and sadly have to say bought it on the reviews I read. If it worked properly and was compatible I may have felt differently but this phone is messed up.",Bad
"This phone has slightly weaker reception quality than my old phone but it is a lot faster processing wise. I tested the phone by calling it with Google Voice and it didn't start ringing till the second ring on Google voice. The auto-focus is okay for the price. I suggest using this phone on wi-fi when possible to help with the weaker reception. Edit: This phone started locking up and going unresponsive after a few months. I can barely use it now. I do not recommend this phone. I know it is cheap, but unresponsive is bad.",Bad
this phone worked for a week and a half and then froze in the middle of the night while charging and never came back on again.,Bad
"Pros- Thin. Is water resistant.Cons- Weak radios for wifi and LTE signal strengths weaker than $25 Moto G. ""Skips"" during playback of MP3 files-- that is just downright pathetic! Comes loaded with all kinds of Sony bloatware. Slow loading apps. Slow switching apps. Slow loading Chrome and Maps.About me: I'm a old school nerd. Was born with a silver AT 286 in my mouth.I do NOT recommend this phone.",Bad
"Just 5 months spent and I need to replace battery because the phone turn off by itself. Also it gets hot,",Bad
"I bought the item on November 27, 2015, I got and started using it around February 2016 (it was with my brother in NY till he came back to Israel- he DID NOT use it). Since June 2016 (4 month after I started using it) I'm having trouble with it- the phone reboots itself every once in a while (sometimes when the battery is low and sometime it's full, sometimes I don't have service and sometimes I do...) and it's not like it's restarting itself and that it- it keeps doing it until I plug the charger in or take off the battery.two days ago (on September 25) I took it to a mobile laboratory to see if I can fix it, the guy there told me that this is must be a refurnished phone and we saw that all the screws on the back (after you take off the cover) are loose (the phone was never open/fixed/in a laboratory before). Moreover- the battery swelled so I had to buy a new one after 10 months!!! (he told me the battery is gotta be a fake).NOT COOL.That's it. I was really looking forward to use this phone. too bad :(",Bad
Not a good phone at all as soon as i got it it started freezing up and not wanting to call out or send messages. Never again will this phone be a choice of my choosing.,Bad
I've had the phone for about a month now and I'd say it's really nothing to write home about. When the CPU usage is a little too high it starts to freeze up quite a bit. I can only use Instagram and Snapchat when most other applications are closed out and when you plug headphones in the volume is automatically throttled down to about %50 even when it says %100 and there's no work around for this issue. I had to purchase a separate Bluetooth headphone adapter to get decent volumes. Other than that I guess for the price the phone will do in a pinch.,Bad
"I initially purchased this phone due to the dual SIM Card feature. First phone I received the second SIM card slot didn't work, Amazon was very prompt on sending a replacement out. Received my replacement and he SIM slot still does not work. Besides that issue the phone isn't bad for the price. Would have given 4 stars but I really needed to run two lines off this phone and cant.",Bad
"Phone runs well. Nice picture, can't complain about operation. However, these phones are about as sturdy as a cupcake. If you bump it, it's done. I'm not just talking about the glass, the screen, and any touch recognition on the entire surface is gone. I wouldn't expect it to be a tank at this price, but obviously no thought was put into reinforcing a phone this size when it was designed. I ordered 3 of these, and they've been babied. Unfortunately none have lasted more than a month's use. The last dropped less than a foot onto carpet, and the screen was SHATTERED. I now own 3 epic paperweights.And, there are NO cases that FIT this.",Bad
came with like 5gb and a broken headphone jack but at least it came thanks.,Bad
"the item is cool, however slide is no too strong to hold. it is shaking when slides open like need support. seems like a gab.back light stays lit all the time when engaged in a phone call. real player music if played fro my galary goes to sleep as soon as the back light goes off. you need to hit any button on the phone to resume playing. max. light back 90 secound. so every 90 secound you need to hit something on the phone to wake it up to be able to continue playing the music if it is realplayer. if it is mp3 not a problem.",Bad
"Good otterbox quality but too much for the iPhone 6 plus. Moveable cover where to put in phone charger is so stiff, it's hard to plug in the charger. Built in screen protector sits a little far from screen making you tap the screen harder to text or use apps. Almost impossible to use the fingerprint recognition feature as the case is deep and the iPhone won't recognize your finger causing you to use the password feature instead. Should have tested this case before releasing it. Had the defender on my iPhone 5 and it was flawless.",Bad
"The phone looks fine. If you are interested in looks go for it. This phone however has the lowest ring volume. The phone will literally be beside me but when it rings, sounds like it's in a room far away from me. no matter how much you increase the volume...still is very low. This is horrible. I would return it if I could ....i'm all the way in Jamaica so that's a real challenge for me.",Bad
"I bought this phone because it was capable of supporting 700mhz band 12 LTE which has better building penetration. Unfortunately, Alcatel was unable to design the phone to support VoLTE, and realized it only after marketing the phone to be compliant. The entire band 12 must be disabled to prevent a situation where the user would be unable to reach emergency services. The phone has lost a lot of value in my eye as a result. If I had known that band 12 would it be supported, I would have purchased a different phone.",Bad
"I was so excited to get this phone. Two folks dear to me had recently purchased it and were very happy about it. Unfortunately I seem to have get the dud phone karma. It looked great out of the box and in tech details, however after literally two days and two different Metro Pcs store, one authorized, one main office, I was never able to get it to work with the network correctly or consistently. Gps was all sorts of not happening as well, but I would think that is absolutely related to it not connecting to a network source when I was out and about. I bought it because of all the reviews saying it jived well with Metro network without trauma drama or strife? Maybe I just really did get that one bad apple in a barrel of great phones, but I can't rate it anything higher as it just didn't work like it was supposed to. Absolutely returning this phone and not sure I am really wanting to try again with the BLU phones. Back to my Samsung galaxy 3 mini I will go.",Bad
Phone works. But its OS becomes unstable after 3 months and has to be factory reset. A brown sticky substance also comes out of the phone in the back at times often leading me to think that at some point my phones previous owner let it go for a swim in some coffee :/ Not too happy with the refurbish job due to this sticky situation.,Bad

"The phone had quite a few issues that cropped up immediately, I am unable to view pictures because the phone claims I need to ""Write script!"", and the flash content is ""not found"". Thus am also unable to change display settings from default, in fact there is no option to change settings on this phone. The outside speaker has already stopped working after 4 days, which was the issue I'd had eventually with every other enV3. I was also unable to use the backup assistant, so I had to manually enter ALL my contacts, and am currently operating without my previously set calendar dates. I have also been receiving blank messages from my friends who have smart phones. Also, the charger the phone came with is ""Not recommended for this phone"" as the phone tells me whenever it's plugged in. Overall not terribly pleased, but I needed a phone in a hurry.",Bad

I loved it for the first few daysthen camera just diedI googled and found that it is common software problem with Lumia and Windows - automatic windows upgrade kills your camera; inserting storage card kills our camera.

"This is NOT a 4G phone. I use it with Tracfone/AT&T and I do get good 2G to 3G coverage. The phone itself has a lot of issues and I don't expect it to last long.

Really disappointing for a person who spend 400$ on a phone who is supposed to be solid and use that as a selling argument...

Considering that I hadn't notified the default at first and over passed the return delay, Thank You Very Much Amazon, great customer service, I won't thank Samsung for their really poor quality control....",Bad
"I amvery disappointed that only after just purchasing the item for 5 months the battery for my I5 Model A1429 has gone bad.

"I buy a smartphone BLU Energy X, last December 2015. It is an excellent phone, but unfortunately with so little time to use, the touch screen does not work, and here in my country is not accessible to find the parts. You can help me, it is very important to me solve this problem.",Bad
"The specs for the phone stated ""multi-language"". I didn't even think to ask in which languages it did its menus until after I received it. It turns out it had English, Spanish & Portuguese. I needed Italian & German.In light of that, I basically could not use it.I did feel that the touch screen was too insensitive for comfortable use.... my comparison was Atrix & iPhone.The company was great in handling the return and refund. I would definitely do business with them again.",Bad
"Let me preface by saying I never write reviews.It's very simple: the phone is fantastic. The seller, not so much. This came as the 16gb variant of the phone with 2gb of memory, as opposed to the 32gb and 3gb of ram variant.The phone is fantastic. I love everything about it. The one problem I have is that the call quality seems to be absolutely awful and it has been since the phone was opened (I've been using it for a month now).If I didn't love the phone so much I would have given a 1 star review. This seller is terrible, buyer beware.",Bad
Like the phone but the charging is now taking for ever with the charger that was shipped with it...,Bad
Because I send it to guyana so do I don't know how it work I could have the and find uot it work,Bad
"The phone looks stylish with sharp corners, rectangle design. But that is it. The apps collection is very poor and the amazon apps didn't help either.Without the apps, whats the entire point of using the smart phone?. Most of the apps in the blackberry collection are very disappointing. Other factors like battery and build quality all are good though. Display is okay, but not so great compared to smartphones which has less cost than this. Back camera is decent, but front camera is disappointing.",Bad
"It worked perfectly for 5 months. The hd quality was astonishing, pictures came out amazing, but it didn't last long. It started after about 5 months. I would take a picture and the phone would shut off. After a while It would loose battery fast, until one day it stopped turning back on. The specs are great in this phone but you won't last long with it, so I do not recommend this.",Bad
"The phone is overheating. Added to that, it has to be charged very often, like every 2 hours or so. I would appreciate it if someone can tell me how this situation can be rectified. Can I have it returned and/or replaced? Please advise me soonest.",Bad
"I was looking forward to the Vivo 5 but I was actually very disappointed and returned it.First off their ""gold"" is actually more of a ROSE GOLD. So it was more pink than gold. The AMOLED screen is clean and wasn't as great as reviewed, its way too oversaturated. The reds appear orange making skin tones in video look natural. Scrolling through Instagram, I could see the 720p screen pixelate pictures. The speaker was very loud and clear which I liked.As for camera, I have a Blu Life One (2015) and figured the Vivo will be just as good if not better, but it was actually a downgrade. The 3GB RAM was good, made phone overall nice and snappy, no lag. I ended up returning it and getting the Honor 5X. Its not as snappy (less RAM) but has so many more features (fingerprint scanner), 1080p screen with better / natural colors, better camera.I would say if you are looking for a 5.5"" budget phone, Vivo 5 and Honor 5X are good buys, but it comes down to preference.",Bad
I Ordered This Phone From This Company. Bad Idea!....This Is A Very Good Phone (When It Works). So If You Would Like To Order It I Dnt Blame You Just Dnt Order It From These People...You Are Unable To Reach Them By Phone! And Thru Email They Had The Nerve To Tell Me The IMEI Number On The Back Of The Phone Doesnt Match There Files! Bt They Sent The Phone To Me! Sounds Fishey Huh???,Bad
"It is remarkable how bad this phone is after only 4 months of use. The pros are it does all the basic stuff your standard smart phone should. Nothing flashy or great, just average to good.But here is where this phone goes from ""ok"" to ""worthless"":- Randomly shuts down or restarts for no reason. Sometimes in the middle if using an app or or phone call- shuts down and won't restart without removing and replacing battery pack- camera is so bad it cannot take a picture that isn't blurry- call quality is only slightly better than a pay phone in rural Uganda- key pad is laggy and frequently unresponsive while texting or typing- the body and structure of the phone is 80% plastic making it flimsy and brittleIf you need a phone to get you by for a few months till your upgrade is available, this phone is ok. If you are looking for a long term upgrade, this phone is worthless.",Bad
"Pros:The device works well with no issues so far and it looks like a brand new oneCons:1- This is NOT factory unlocked, I took it to the Apple store and told me that the device was unlocked a moth ago2- This is a Refurbished device. When you buy the device you have the option to choose a ""new"" or ""used"" device and I chose the new one but was told by the Apple store that it is used for several years.3- I was told by the Apple employee that the Back and front screens are after market parts and not original, even the box is a very cheap replica of the original one.4- Not worth the price. You can add $50 dollars to the price and get a Refurbished 5C phone, much nicer and updated version. I would have done that if they had mentioned it's condition in advance.",Bad

"First ever review on Amazon. Bought this phone about a month ago. First few weeks thought it was a pretty alright phone. But... then you start noticing the phone activitng the flashlight by it self, music will all good office sudden stop playing, and now people can hear me when I'm talking on the phone. Sounds like I'm in a tunnel to tell me. This phone is not worth the purchase, it has too many everyday problems. I'll honestly give a 5/10. The price and screen are the only positives. This phone is full of glitches from top to bottom and very frustrating to use day to day.",Bad
"I LOVED this phone! I love Windows OS and this phone was a big upgrade from Nokia Lumia 521....then all of a sudden it died... would just turn off and not respond to power button. The screen had come loose and it looked like dried glue was around edges. This was supposed to be a NEW not refurbished Nokia Lumia 1020! I am soooo bummed. Waiting to see if I get full refund. I will be upset if I don't bc I paid over $300. Loved the camera on this phone... if you can get a LEGIT new phone it might be worth it... but look into known problems. Nobody sells them anymore perhaps for a reason. I did not drop it... it was in a good case, I was SUPER careful with it bc I had lost my last phone and hated spending so much money... plus I loved it... until it died 2 weeks in!",Bad
HTC is a great manufacturer with outstanding widgets but the device has charging issues therefore I am returning.,Bad
"The seller that I bought from wouldn't ever email me back and once the phone got here, it had nicks and dings in the outer metal and the screen is messed up in one spot beneath the surface and now the screen can be bended in on the side and top right corner. You get what you pay for I guess.",Bad
"It works, but it could easily be better.Issues:The contrast between the primary characters and alt characters on the keyboard is not good, unless the sun is out the alt characters on the keyboard can barely be seen. Utterly useless in the dark.The processor is rather slow and interactions often get bogged down.The phone storage is very limited. There is a large amount of bloatware on the device and on a regular basis we have had to delete messages and app info on a regular basis to ensure we can get messages.",Bad
"While Windows Phone is the absolute best phone OS on the market today, BLU does it injustice with this phone. While they purport that it will work on the AT&T and T-Mobile networks, SMS only works occasionally, MMS almost never, and Data is spotty at best. T-Mobile states this phone will only be able to get phone service, not data or MMS.This phone constantly lags, and is slow. After having use a Lumia for years, this is a total set back and I cannot get rid of it soon enough. Do Not Buy.",Bad
"I do not recommend this phone for the elderly.Pros:* Big buttons and simple interface for elderly* Dual simCons:* Awful cellular reception, even where other phones get great signal* Phone has a cheap feeling to it.* No volume control buttons on side make it hard for elderly to increase volume* If only 1 sim slot is filled, the display keeps displaying ""Insert Sim"" which confuses elderly* Poor overall volume - not for hard of hearing* Manual does not match phone (it talks about an included camera - there is none, and Bluetooth - there is none)",Bad
"Purchased this for a relative in Jamaica. Chose it because of the dual sim feature and the phone was unlocked. These are ideal features for islanders since most residents carry two cell phones, one for each carrier. Unfortunately, the instrument didn't work as well. It froze from time to time or dropped calls a lot. I am disappointed.",Bad
The phone had a crack in the back and the volume on the phone was very low. When turning up the volume I still unable to hear others people on the phone. Returned to seller and they were gladly to refund my phone.,Bad
"Well I recieved the phone in time, arrived in a sealed box. Having a lot of difficulty with phone calls- getting service on the phone, dropping calls, crackling noise, difficulty hearing people. I do not know if it is the phone because it is an unlocked phone or just the service but before when I had my other phone I did not have this difficulty. I would like to know if others have had the same problem with phones that they have purchased like this one.",Bad
"While the item that I received was, in fact, an unlocked version of this phone, it was an AT&T branded unlocked phone. It will work on any GSM network, but the unlocked AT&T versions of this phone are currently unable to receive security updates or other software upgrades unless you are connected to the AT&T network with an AT&T SIM card. If this is acceptable for you, then by all means this phone will work well. As for me, I can say that the return process has gone very smoothly.",Bad
"Most of the apps don't work with a Samsung S4. For the money it's a decent geeky watch. But it is not a smart watch, at least for me. It kept dropping connection with the phone which is my major gripe. Battery life is fair and the recharge connection is a pain. Good for a pre teen.",Bad

I tried to update it and be able to set maximum speed to 3G (which shoukd work) but it does not allow me this option (blocked by ATT).

"The first couple of days the phone worked great. Soon after I got it though, the speaker stopped working and the headphone jack no longer worked.",Bad
"This phone was great, in the initial design. Everything else sucked.Okay, so you know how you press the little symbol button and then other buttons to make the symbols on them? This works for about half the keys, but the rest are mistlabeled. Also, a ""qwerty"" keyboard has the space bar in the middle. It's so inconvenient to relearn the placement of this after years of use with it in the middle on other phones.As far as user-friendly, this phone is not. If you haven't used fancy expensive phones before, you might wanna try to get someone who knows what they're doing to show you how to use this phone.Further, I have not yet been able to figure out how to get the web and MMS to work on it for StraightTalk and there is NOTHING on the internet about that.",Bad

"This was listed as new. It was not. The box had been opened and there was debris on the phone. Upon inserting the battery and my sim card the phone started up and all seemed promising but the screen immediatly went black. No results when I pressed the power button. Considered that maybe the battery was not partially charged I plugged the phone in and allowed it to charge however there was no amber light indicating that it was charging. After 2 hours I checked again and it would still not power on. I removed the batter and sim card, replaced both, and tried again. This time all I got was the HTC screen. Third time, not a charm, absolutley nothing. Not really sure if I will reorder or not but this is being returned tomorrow.",Bad
"Bought this phone for my mom since she liked the slide screen and the ease of typing. We received this product in the mail just fine. When we put her sim card in the back of the phone the back piece would not snap in place this was frustrating. We somehow got the back piece in place even though it was a super tight fit and taking it back off as now just as hard as trying to put it back on. Then a week later I see the slider side of the phone was dangling from the keyboard piece of the phone, upon further inspection I saw that the slider hinges came off and were useless to the phone. Now the phone is in two pieces and useless. Worst phone ever.",Bad
I bought this phone and took it abroad. It worked for 2 weeks. After which the battery turns dead when it shows 75% charge left in it. I need to charge it again at which point it shows it is starting from 0%.Not sure if the battery needs replacement or the phone itself. But since I am out of the country right now I cannot even get it replaced. I really wish the manufacture or seller would give me a new battery. That would help me check if it is the battery problem.So not happy with the product.,Bad

"Having previously owned Blackberry's I thought this phone would be a cheap replacement until the 9310 came out... I was dead wrong. Upon arriving, the the scroll ball was already coming loose from the phone and the phone froze often. I could hardly use it, not to mention it has a odd sized charger so if I left my charger at home or in the car, I couldn't use anyone elses which resulted in me having a dead battery a lot of the time. Don't buy this product, I'd opt for the 9310.",Bad
"Represented as certified refurbished. The cable(slightly shorter) and charger are not original.Most importantly, the charger has no test lab approval markings. Various companies conduct tests for quality and safety. Although test lab approval may not be required by law, many local agencies frown on non approved products and may prohibit their use especially in schools and hospitals. Better manufacturers submit their products for testing and evaluation approvals which can be lengthy and very expensive.I suppose if I asked the manufacturer for support regarding charging issues, their first question would likely be, ""Are you using an original charger?""If I were the manufacturer of the phone, I would be very concerned about the substituting of the original charger with charger not bearing an approval from one of the test labs.",Bad
The phone I received has a loose homekey/fingerprint sensor. Its so loose that you can hear it rattle. How does something like this get past quality control and actually make it to the consumer? Returned.,Bad
"The phone had some great feature and was exciting for the first couple of days. However, I realized that my internet was slow, so I called customer service and was told since it wasn't a T-Mobile phone it didn't pick the 4G and I was only able to run 2G or edge and those are extremely basic and slow. It was like trying to use the Internet on a Nokia. Interne being one of the most important features it pretty much out shine everything else about the phone. Its a real pain to always have to try and find Wifi just to pull up Gogogle.",Bad

"The on/off button sticks so it's hard to lock the phone, also the battery doesn't hold its charge well. I think that's a common problem with iPhones . It can go instantly from 60% to 20% and then from 20% to zero and turn off completely.",Bad
"After buying this phone for a friend, she loved how it worked but it cracked when slipping out of a chair and falling 11 inches and it ruined the ENTIRE mid section of the input area, which denotes something of a ""cheap"" screen to me. When we ordered parts to repair it, we found that the wiring for the screen was so tucked and glued it was a lost cause and we had to just throw the phone in the trash (and i replace laptop LCDs for a living along with a few phones). It was just too much of a hassle so we just bought a different phone.This phone could be called a ""nice"" throw-away phone, kinda like the ones you get in Dollar General. Use it, you will enjoy it, but protect it like it's an infant child because it will break at the drop of a dime (so to speak) and it's a serious hassle to even get into with all the gluing going on inside of it.",Bad

"The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are.",Bad
"I'm pretty disappointed...the seller said that this would run on AT&Ts LTE network, it does not. It only gets 2G, which is utter crap.

It shuts off and won't turn back on right away. I can't believe I wasted almost $300 on this!!! I have bought phones that have cost less then half of this and they have worked ten times better.

This os was actually older than the one on the phone that I was replacing; which was android 2.3 (jellybean).

There is no way to change the button/apps in the home screen3. There is no way to reassign the scroll buttons, I want to be able to access the camera quickly by reassigning a button, but I could not find it after trying all options4.

"I wanted a gift for a friend I was going to see out of the country, & I ordered this Motorola RAZR which was delivered promply, Thats the ONLY reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1,,,the Reasonfor this is the phone speaker did not work at all, No one could hear him talking,It is Not convienent to return it because he lives in the DR and shipping is a nightmare! However I gave him the money it will take to fix this, I'm hoping this can be fixed so that my friend will be able to enjoy the gift I gave him.",Bad
"Not really what I expected. This model seems to have issues connectin to the TMobile data network. Never would it give me 4G LTE, OCCASIONALLY would I get a 3G connection.Ontop of it all I had to deal with a factory Hungarian configuration, so if you do not speak Hungarian, you will have some hard time around.Good Luck!",Bad
Very slow . Nothing to notify messages . Apps must be downloaded for everything . Have to download phone app to use the phone ...like dialing .,Bad
"phone has poor sound quality .. cannot change battery ""internal"" within 3 months have to charge every night sometimes twice a day, know its not the most expensive phone but the battery on a new phone should not stop working well at least longer.. sometimes takes a bunch of tries to get it to turn on, that's been happening since it was only a couple months.",Bad
"Bricked within one week of owning it. I was driving to a work assignment, using Google Maps to get me there. About 3/4 of the way there, system froze completely, and would not respond to any commands, or any soft or hard reset attempts as indicated by Motorola support, who then said to ship it back for replacement. Of course, the replacement would have been a refurbished model, and not a new one, so I returned it through Amazon and got my money back.",Bad
"I bought 2 Sony Xperia Ion Lt28at&t almost 5 weeks ago and with many apps confirming what in effect the memory ram is: 646 mb not 1Gb, even has 2 cores not 4 how in the characteristics appear and when it is in 3g network appear the symbol 4G in the notification bar, not has tested in LTE, but must admit it the OS is the ICS more it the 2.3.6 Android version. And this Phone not came with earphones thing that if doing the other models of Sony and must say that battery is poor to many specifications that has..",Bad
"The iPhone was represented as used, which it was. The description did not mention the Otter commuter box which came with the iPhone, which was a nice surprise. However, the iPhone has been less reliable than my previous new phone was, although how I use the phone has not changed. I noticed the first day that the battery runs down faster, and is sometimes depleted before the day is over. A new twist is that now I cannot put some calls through. When I enter a phone number to place a phone call, the screen indicates the call is connected because the seconds are incrementing. However, I don't hear a ring or hear the receiving party. This is inconvenient for a phone. I wonder what feature will have reduced functionality next. I expected that a phone, although used, would be more reliable and that its deficits would have been clearly described in the offering information. Even on Amazon, with a highly ranked seller, buyer beware.",Bad
Hard plastic casing ha two large cracks after only three months of use. Have never had problems with other protective cases cracking in the past.,Bad
"I really wanted to like the phone, but I had to return it. It looks and feels great ... but used on my AT&T service I had almost NO 4G LTE data speed. (my old 3 year old phone had much better 4G LTE speeds). I read somewhere that the phone doesn't have all the 4G cannels that it needs to provide 4G service for several US providers.",Bad
"The service from the seller was ok. The phone is a disaster, especially while making, answering and viewing phone calls. If I am in a call already and I need to press 0 for the operator, the hang up red button covers the zero and my only option is to hang up! Other times while the phone is ringing there is no option to answer it! I can not see my full call history, whenever I tried to recall it the phone goes back to the home screen. Many people complain that they cannot hear me through the phone. Some of these problems get fix when I reboot the phone, but I have to do it a couple times a day!!! Even when I reboot the phone I cannot recall my full call history.",Bad
"After some months of service this device has become extremely frustrating in that the phone function is frequently unresponsive. I have to press dial over and over and have missed several calls as I could not get it to respond when I tried to answer the call. Seems to be a progressive problem as it has gone from OK at first to infuriating now. Despite all the other nice stuff it does, for heaven's sake it's primarily a phone! Looks like a good deal up front; it will cost you more in the end when you are so aggravated that you have to replace it!",Bad
had this for a year and it has had several problems first off has to do with the processor it keeps shutting down programs and bugging out in addition to that I has been rapidly turning the Bluetooth off and back on again and lastly starting about 4 months ago the charging port has only been working about half of the time.,Bad
"I have to keep rebooting to keep signals but, if you want it to work with just wifi it's ok.",Bad
I was taking back that the phone doesn't use a regular Sim but a nano Sim which had to be inserted in the side of the phone that was a deal breaker for me cause I had gotten the phone for a family member overseas,Bad
"I have problems with my camera, doesn't work properly as an iPhone 6 normally do.Please let me know if I can replace it or change the camera.",Bad
I thought Sony was the best brand I m very disappointed with the camera picture not very good and other stuff,Bad
The phone works by 10/4Battery and the camera does not work well in addition to the presence of scratches on the screen,Bad
Phone was cool my current phone is with boost mobile so I couldn't switch over to use this phone because its not compatible battery is good though the phone is big but nice. I would give 5 stars if I was able to use boost mobile,Bad
Very slow in everything..I mean it's not an iphone but still...I would not recommend it.,Bad
"Phone works good but the charger you sent does not work. This is an issue for me, as I purchased one of the more expensive phones available for the purpose that it came with the charger & head phones.",Bad
"I waited a month before writing a review.I love this phone! I have my data/minutes thru Net10 and I had no problems switching from my LG phone to this. I use this for everything! As my kindle, social media, shopping, Netflix, camera, everything but as a phone.I hate talking on the phone but when I do this is fine. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is sometimes when I'm texting or commenting on FB it posts before I finish. Honesty it's s terrific phone with tons of coolness for less than $100.****August 8, 2016*****Well, I loved this phone up until a week ago. I had problems turning/keeping it on and now its dead. I think $100+ is a lot for a phone to only last a year. It refused to charge, not the battery, it was the charging port. It broke my heart cause I really loved this phone. Im using the $50 phone I bought with a Net10 package several years ago. No problems with that little LG phone.Im doubtful I'll buy Blu again.",Bad
"The cell phone is good. You get what you pay for. The functions are ok. The good point is that it is android, easy to use. The bad point is the battery that needs to be recharged everyday. It takes more then 4 hours to recharge it and after 20 hours you'll have to do it again. It is driving me craaaazy!!!!!!",Bad
it is new open one as i found the package open and has now user manual,Bad
"I did not like, it worked just 24 hours. After putting on the sim car, explore the phone and charge it. I trailed off and now does not work",Bad
Junk phone. If you're broke and need a phone in a hurry then I would recommend this phone.,Bad
blu is the worse types of phone... would not spend another dollar on anyone of them... I went through 3 blu in one year. Do not worth it,Bad
"If your idea is to save money and have a dual sim phone, then you should buy this one, but be aware that this phone is slow, has low resolution and it gets ""crazy"" sometimes...",Bad
"I only had this phone for 7 month. First of all, I had spent countless hours working with ATT on 4G without success. But the same sim card works just fine on iPhone for 4G. Even with Asia sim card, it was the same issue. So, 4G never worked for me. Now this phone randomly drop my calls at the middle of the conversation. Charging is starting to giving me issue as well. Connecting the original charger would not charge sometimes (I had bought additional ASUS charger, so it was not the charger issue). I have to reboot the phone then it would start charging. This phone is worse than the Android phone I had for $99 earlier. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. If you think you are getting a barging, well think again.",Bad
For the money you can't beat this phone but the internal speaker is CRAP. It sounds all crackled up and you can't hear your ring tones clearly or if your playing a game on it. I did get it today on Sunday and the instruction manual is so small print I'm sure most of the people can't read it. Thank goodness wasn't too hard to get started. I wouldn't waste your money on this phone.,Bad
Was great while it lasted.... for my son that was only three days! Not near heavy duty enough for wearing it on your wrist.,Bad
It disconnects a LOT and tells me to download the BT Notifier app..but I already have. I just want it to stay connected to my phone and work properly.,Bad
"The battery just work a few hours and gets off. Also the screen is not sensitive enough, You did not include head phone in the box. I wish you could send me another battery and head phone.",Bad
"As its an International version, please make a not that your carrier would not support it. TMobile you wont get 4LTE data at all, they have separate model built for T Mobile.",Bad
"I could not get this phone to work with Sprint. It is my understanding that Sprint is CDMA 2000. I tried for 2 months, with Sprints help. No luck. I really wanted to like this phone but couldnt get it to work. I have read on multiple sites it works with Sprint......not for me :(",Bad
My phone was supposed to come by the 18th. I needed it to take pictures at my daughters wedding! It's now the 20th...still no phone and the wedding is over!,Bad
When the phone was sent to me the charging. Port didn't work had to buy a separate charger for my phone so while my phone charges up no one can contact me if there's an emergency other then that it works great but I feel not being able to charge it normally should have been mentioned in the details before I spent $264.,Bad
It's a shame to sell a refurbished product without functional testing. Storm received my 9530 and it just came with a defect in the telephone jack to charge the battery. Have tested the charger on other phones and it is working perfect. The USB does not work (since the defect is on the phone). I am totally dissatisfied with the phone because of the defect. If there was no defect rate the phone 5 stars. Unfortunately downside for Amazon!,Bad
came in looking used. have not really used so will return it. i bought before and was nice. but this one is far below par,Bad
Got a Nano sim card and Micro SIM adapter. It was almost impossible to put it in the device. Finally dropped the adapter somewhere during the numerous efforts to put the SIM card. Have not been able to use the phone yet.,Bad
Phone came with no sim card. This should have been clearly stated in the what's in the box description.,Bad
"Loved this watch's features such as camera, and Bluetooth and that it works using Bluetooth with I phone but it wasn't very comfortable on my wrist..I stopped using it after I purchased the new rose gold Apple Watch",Bad
Looked and fit great... unfortunately it would not stay connected to my Note 4 and had oto return,Bad
I've had this phone for a month started out good but two weeks later the speaker blew out then its slow i have only downloaded one app. I will so be buying a new one phone,Bad
"Please...In the description at Amazon, it says: ""In the box - Blackberry Storm 2 9550 Unlocked - Battery - Travel Charger - Data Cable - Stereo Headset - 16gb microsd"", but 16gb microsd didn't come, the memory isn't in the box. Up and down of the cellular has scratch. Please your comentary.Regards",Bad
"It is not described as is, bad picture never show reality, next time i will not buy before seeing picture and will never trust sellers",Bad
"I like the idea of a simple phone, but this OS isn't very usable. I wanted something closer to Symbian for Nokia. Sound quality is really good though.",Bad
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,Bad
This otterbox is terrible compared to the discontinued same model. Because of the hole in the plastic water is constantly getting inside. I wish I hadn't paid 20.00 for this because I am going to have to use my old case. I have to take this one off and clean it way too often.,Bad
Phone glass is littlebit scratch n than back site too it looks like old phone,Bad
Might have been a nice phone if it worked. Updated the software over the air and would not ever restart past the samsung screen.,Bad
"El celular viene en versiÌ_n China, no tiene todas las funciones, mÌÁs bien yo pienso que funciona como sÌ_ fuera un clon",Bad
Phone look was brand new. After only one month the phone had a software issue. I advise you if you purchase get the phone checked out.,Bad
"Good:- Great camera.- Smaller size fits in your pocket better than most phablet phones.Bad:- The inductive power charge jack broke. I must return it for repairs.- Terrible Sony version of Android. They made Android much worse in my opinion.- Terrible Sony apps can't be deleted, but clog the device, and trigger annoying notifications.- If you want to switch to straight Google Android OS, it makes the camera image processors not work. This makes the camera below average.- Easy to break/scratch glass on both sides of phone. Sony is too cheap to use Corning Gorilla Glass.- Phone feels more bulky than expected.",Bad
"Storm 9530 purchase 3 wks ago not working anymore,just ordered another battery, it doesnt charge d other battery and dnt come on anymore",Bad
"very fine product, its works perfectly, is exactly were i spected good conditions very weel nice deal thanks you at all butthe battery was damage in the trip",Bad
I ordered this but it came it a pastel lavender. Not what was advertised. Like someone wrote looks like Easter egg color.,Bad
"It came with scratches and dents on three of its edges.and the worst part is the so-called refurbished phone did 382 battery cycles!The seller is called ""MyWit""",Bad
"The was suppose to be new but my phone dies at 49%, which should be happening since its a new phone. I know not to charge it over night or have on longer then needed. But i only had the phone for 3 weeks",Bad
Not very good...the connection to upload or download is so long...would not recommend this phone,Bad
"It works, so it is worth more than 1 star. Its description is ""new"", but the battery is 0%, the box is a bit old and has ""double stickered"" to hold it tight, and the screen protector has bubbles. All these ""features"" make me believe that it's not really a new one. But I don't have enough time to return it and buy another phone, so I can only use it.",Bad
"The phone's appearance is great as what's been said on the description. However, im having problems with the sound. Sometimes when it play a video, it wont make a sound..and it types incorrectly most of the time. :(",Bad
