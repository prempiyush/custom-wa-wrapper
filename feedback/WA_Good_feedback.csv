"the htc wildfire is a great phone and everything that i needed.if i could have just anything i would have it be an inch larger but this is easy to carry and use and does everything a pda and game system and mp3 player three times its price would do. entertains me at the gym, keeps my schedules, checks in on my social media and email all on wifi. the modern apps all download and play. it also makes and recieves calls.love it",Good
"I love everything about this phone. It works perfect 95% of the time. The problem is that on occasion the media/main speaker on the back of the phone will turn off and all sound will emit from the small phone speaker on the screen side. This is fixable by restarting the phone which takes maybe 15 seconds tops. I love the screen size, its comparable to the iPhone 6. Very customizable interface, as Android always is. Never have a problem with apps closing or freezing. Long battery, especially with the power save option. With regular use (using apps, internet, GPS, calling and texting), I can make the battery last an entire weekend. Camera is also great quality, front and back, ans has a lot of built in editing. I would recommend this phone to anyone.",Good
"This is a great, stylish phone which holds up a lot better than some people say. However, it isn't very loud. It's often hard to hear people talking when it's on the highest volume. Speaker phone helps some, but that means everyone else can hear your conversation and no one wants to be like Dennis Franz on those Nextel commercials - annoying.",Good
This has become my wife's favorite phone of all time. She told me she wanted a smaller phone but I got her this as a gift anyway knowing she uses Skype all the time (also hoping she would make me get her another one and I could take this one but she kept it loves it). I got her the watch as well so she wouldn't have issues with the size but she rarely uses the watch.,Good
"The BLU Vivo 5R is a pretty good budget phone. The fingerprint sensor is fast (faster than Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x). Sound is great and the UI is pretty intuitive. However, the BLU software could use some tweeking. I have noticed that sometimes after opening the device it doesn't respond to touch immediately. That only happened a few times, though. for $199 this phone is a steal. However, if you have some more cash to spend then go for the OnePlus 3 or Huawei Honor 8.",Good
Friendly. main advantage is the battery life. very good screen resolution. The micro processor is a little slow but I recommend it.,Good
I bought this item for my cousin. She was using for 2 years and then suddenly it has some problem. Because of the connection of screen and keyboard. But it was fine phone for 2 years.,Good
"the mobile is operating well, the only thing bad is their poor battery life that rapicimo download.I do not really like that part",Good
This is a great looking phone. It works great and was in prestine condition. I bought it as a gift and almost want to keep it for myself. I can't wait for my son to begin using it. I was very impressed with the quick turnaround. I'm very satisfied!!!,Good
One of the best phones out there. Only con I can think of is that the screens are very fragile. Not for an active person,Good
Protects phone well but sometimes water or steam will get under screen cover and had to be completely taken apart to clean. Button functionality is good. Would have been better in green and black but the grey isn't bad.,Good
The size of the screen is great! Specs wise good value for money. Camera would need to improve specially for night shots. Wireless charging a wish!,Good
Phone is dependable. It does the job its bought for. I recommend this seller. Only reason it didnt get 5 stars is because battery life is not as long as it should be.,Good
The product meets expectations. The check for the Amazon.com page and adjusted to my needs and to make a gift. With a good price.,Good
"la experiencia fue un poco nerviosa porque era la primera vez pero ya conociedo los prosidimiento ya puedo dar fe que son seria en las gestiones, ya pueden contar con un nuevo comprador en amazon.com estoy muy complasido con sus servicios atentamente german padron gracias",Good
"I'm from Venezuela and this phone looks great, I love it, it comes almost ready-to-use... The only minus is the charger, I can't use this type of charger in my country and there is no adapter that fits to the plug. BUT: I bought an universal HTC charger and it solved the problem...Soy de Venezuela y este telÌ©fono luce genial, me encanta, viene casi listo para usar. Lo Ì¼nico que no me gustÌ_ fue el cargador, no puedo usar este tipo de cargador en mi paÌ_s y no hay adaptador que le quede. PERO: ComprÌ© un cargador universal HTC y esto resolviÌ_ el problema...",Good
"I purchased this phone for my mother who is abroad, and for the price the phone is good. It takes great pictures and the screen images are extremely crisp and clear.",Good
"I love the phone but had a problem with the screen acting up while charging. I got a hold of motorola and I am sending it in for repairs. They knew of the problem but still are sending them out while this happening. I twould have been 5 stars execpt for this. I have only had this for 2 days. It would have been a 5 star if it was not for this I love the size the speed, the camera and it in general. I will update this review when I get the phone back.",Good
Great phone. Delivered with Europe and American charger. It's working fine and simlock free so you can use any micro sim.,Good
This phone was a good choice for someone that has never had a smart phone. He has been able to learn it mostly on his own,Good
"From 4.5"" to 6.0"" phone I believe I will enjoy this phone. I do not know if this isl really the most powerful phone as mentioned in the description. The phone is working perfectly, although the phone announces on the bottom, ""T-mobile 3g, no sim card"", everytime I turn it ON. Is this a concern? I have this BLU phone for just two(2) days and enjoying it. So far, so good. No adverse comment..",Good
Great phone. The front and back camera are great. The quality of the pictures were pretty good. The video quality is great. The speed of the phone is pretty good. The phone is well made. Doesn't seem cheap at all. Works well with Net10 in my area. The only downside for me was that it was a bit large. I needed it for work and it was a bit large for my pocket. Still a great phone. To some the large screen would be a great thing. Just not what I needed it for.,Good
"i got this phone for $144 from CellDepot, it says i saved $500 _Ù÷¦. Definitely worth 600 bucks exept on amazon it said perfect condition.....not in perfect condition. it came with a few scratches on the screen and the microphone for calling does not work.BUT....everything else works perfectly so there goes a star because its not in perfect condition.congrats...",Good
"This phone easily replaced my older, broken phone and has been easy to program and use just as I did the older version.",Good
It 's my first Sansung. I had a Blackberry before it. SO NICE! I'll buy another one to my husband. The cam is very good.I,Good
"I love , is it very easy !!!! en works fantastic!!! I recommend !!! works very good all counties!!!funciona muy bien todos los paises !!!!",Good
"Really nice phone. Simple to use - just like all Android phones. What I really like is that it is water resistance. It's slim, light, and fits comfortably in my pocket.",Good
"Used Samsung Rogue was in pretty good shape. The screen had a fleck of something (don't want to know what it was) that was easily cleaned off, so there's no excuse for it being sent out that way.I ordered it as a replacement for my old Rogue, which no longer had a functional touch screen. Touch screen on this one is fine... everything seems to work, except adjusting the sound volume for specific alerts...I decided to go ahead and take advantage of a good offer on a smartphone, but I'm keeping this as a user friendly phone for an elderly relative.",Good
"Great phone for the price. Everything works well, integrates with my Windows desktop computer. Now with Windows 8.1 update, it features the Cortana personal assistant. the Camera is very nice as well. Not the top of the line Nokia windows phone, but for the price performance ratio, it is great for what I want it to do. This is a new phone, the one I purchased, from Mango Wireless, and I only had to take it to the closest Verizon store to buy a 4G SIM card for $10.00. The GSM is unlocked, but not something I have needed to use, at this point. So check with your carrier to see if it will work. Oh yeah, I really like the ability to set quiet time, so you don't have to be bothered by calls. You can schedule it at a specific time everyday, or turn it on manually. And you can set a list of contacts that you want to allow through the block.",Good
Better than my last phone would give 5 stars but the battery takes a long time to charge.,Good
"This was a much appreciated gift for someone who wanted to stay with a flip phone instead of switching to a new touch screen type of phone. The speaker works very well and is loud even in the car. There has been some difficulty transferring the contacts from the old phone. All in all, it looks and feels sturdy and well made and was ready to make and receive calls as soon as the SIM card was installed.",Good
"I used to be an iphone guy. For a really long time.My problem now is to find the replacement to my apps, as and example, my home banking app.Not everyone think out of the android or ios box, so, for me, now, thats the only problem.The phone indeed is beautiful. The camera is good (not so good when you use the fancy nokia app) and the performance is flawless.The only thing that bother me is when you unlock the phone or when you change from one app to anotheryou see a loading screen for a brief time.Besides that, the phone is a great piece of hardware and windows phone is still growing.",Good
- It more or less works like it's supposed to.- I like the sturdy build quality...doesn't have that cheap plastic-y feel- I find that I need to recharge every 48 hrs regardless of how long a talk (which isn't much).- I wish it had a more standard audio ja,Good
"Have had many Otterbox products, and again, this did not disappoint. I am partial to the built in screen cover. This phone gets used on my farm regularly, so it is exposed constantly to dust, liquids, oil, grease, and more substances than I care to mention. My only gripe is that the well built holster is no where near strong enough for me, and I need to find a large holster that can hold this phone with it's case. Reason is say that it is not strong enough - put it on your belt, lay down in the gravel under a truck or tractor, and roll around on it. Yes, that is the abuse it needs to take. Also, I have broken several Otterbox holsters catching them on metal objects and having them torn from my belt. Again, the case for the phone is first rate, and few consumers want a holster as heavy as I need it, but wanted to point it out nonetheless.",Good
"I did not know that it can only use mimi-simcards. I don't really think that that makes it very ""international"" as the title says. Other than that, the phone is everything I wanted and more. Greaut Buy!",Good
"For all of those having issues with data connection, this is an issue that shouldn't arise, but I have your solution!!! I just fixed mine today. I have Vodafone DE for reference. All you have to do is download the app called ""APN Settings"" from the play store and find your carrier. Record the APN info it provides you with, then go to your mobile data settings, select APNs, click the three dots at the top and select New APN, and fill in the blanks and save it. Then click the dot to the far right to select the APN you created, and viola! Welcome to your unlocked, functional HTC Desire 610!*Note: This method has worked for me and many others. I hope it works for you too, but I'm not claiming it will. Also, you must alter your APN every time you switch carriers.",Good
"previous owner did not remove some features, and we do not have pass word to reset",Good
"I'm still getting used to it. It's a much bigger phone than my iPhone 4S. One issue already. When putting the sim card from the 4S into this phone, I received a message stating that I needed a new sim card to unlock all the features of the Galaxy. However, all of the features that I've tried so far work. I chatted with an AT&T Rep online, and he stated that a new sim would be free, and that he could send one, or I could go and pick one up at the AT&T store. So it's plug and play, but not if you want all the features.The phone comes packed with features and for my taste, a superior OS. Taking the back off is a snap (literally). No more proprietary screws just to swap out a battery. Because it's bigger, it's a little more difficult to hold. Even though the back is textured, it's still not very grippy. I've ordered a rubberized shock resistant case, so should help.::Edit:: Went to the AT&T store for my new sim, and was in and out in 5 minutes. Only costs the gas and time to get there. Great service.",Good
"Amazing phone for the price. It's got everything the average smart phone user wants and pretty sleek as well. The only limitation is its 1GHZ processor, which means your limited in the number of apps you can run concurrently. However, methinks BLU Wil sure improve on this by the next Life View release. Being a frequent traveler and based in Nigeria, the dual SIM nailed it for me.",Good
"They made another of their top quality Nexus phones, only one note on this one: the lock button and even more the volume button are located too low, when you hold the phone is quite easy to press them. The rest all perfect",Good
"I have had this phone well over 2 and a half years. It is always reliable and there when I need it. The camera on the LG Vu is outstanding! It seems like it takes 6MP pictures but really it is 2MP. It has a simple user interface and easy to use for the average consumer. The call quality is good too. The only flaw I found really is texting, with a full touch screen QWERTY keyboard, it can be a little inaccurate sometimes. Overall 4/5 on this phone. Long battery life, great pictures, and this phone is meant to last!",Good
IPhone 4 is pretty good.. However many features which are added in ios6 are not available for iPhone4. I don't see any real reason as hardware for many of the features. So little disappointed with that.,Good
"Well,I didn't actually purchased the Posh Mobile Icon s510 GSM phone foright myself,I bought it as gift for a friend,according to the friend,he likes it,and really enjoyed it!",Good
"Nice phoe for the price.It arrived on time and have not had any problems with it yet,for the price it is very good quality",Good
"The plastic is thinner than the genuine Otter Box holder, so I am concerned it won't last but only time will tell. The clip rotates nicely so you can angle it and it doesn't dig into your waist. You can't beat the price.",Good
"I purchased this phone a few weeks before the Curve 9320.This phone has a ton of great features and upgrades from my Blackberry 8820.Small, great screen, Blackberry features and fast.A very good value from a vendor that shipped quickly.Unfortunately this phone was lost in transit to work and I was forced to buy a new one. I just hope that whomever found it is able to enjoy it as much as I did for the few days that I had the unit.",Good
phone is pretty good...android 2.3 is ok. Sometimes its a little slow but what do you expect from a relatively old phone,Good
Performs as expected as good as the original. In new condition as advertised. My daughter is very please with the phone.,Good
Great durable phone for my non-tech savvy husband. This does the job for him with relatively no frills. Very happy with this purchase.,Good
Great phone for the price. It has a great display and the phone takes great pictures. I would recommend this phone to anyone.,Good
"Nevertheless the power adapter was European type. Also Facetime is not available in this phone. It works ok for the rest, it was new, wrapped, no scratches.",Good
"i'm really happy to use this kind of mobile. evrey easy use, clear eecreen, nice sheap and verey semble mobile.",Good
Only complain is that the phone had no instruction booklet with it . Or any other paperwork or proof of purchase.,Good
"Just bought 3 of these in pink, blue and orange. First impression they have amazing HD screens. Honestly better looking than my Note 4 screen! Very light weight and the back you have to make sure it's snapped back on all edges (kinda flimsy compared to high end phones which is why I gave 4 stars) but for under $100 it's okay! Came with whats pictured, gel cover, charger, screen protector, and ear buds which is a PLUS in my book! The pink is more of a salmon bright pink, the orange is neon, and the blue looks more teal to me. Overall pretty cool. Only made one call and message and so far so good. Will update after the kids use them more. They are christmas gifts and I think they will be pleased! We have tmobile and the SIM card went right in SIM 2 spot easily. This is and upgrade for the kids from the tiny galaxy light smartphones. They wanted iPhone 5c because of the different colors but I think they will love these more!",Good
Nothing fancy but exactly what I paid for so I like it. Got it on time as well.,Good
"I got a Verizon GSM global unlocked product delivered.It did not need a sim to activate the phone. That's good. But when i saw Verizon in the product information, i tried an AT&T sim to check if its actually unlocked and it worked fine. I removed the sim. I'm using the phone just for Whatsapp, camera and sometimes songs/videos. Phone is awesome for pics. 8GB storage is the only drawback. Considering that its an apple phone, it wont let you do much anyway. Transferring photos and syncing stuff is a nightmare if you have been an android user forever(which i am). Otherwise, if your expectation is set right, this phone is an awesome steal.",Good
"second blu phone this one feels cheaper in your hands but over is a fantastic phone so far. so many features, good screen size, battery life is less than a day on heavier use. also come with a gyro not sure why none of ads listed that.",Good
The only problem with the phone was that not include a Spanish language to change to it and was a present for a Spanish speaker person.,Good
"It is good, no more, no less. It work well, but it is not too fast. Camera iss good, but at nithg, quality get down. But, because of its price, it's a very good product.",Good
"This phone is everything its cracked up too be. The only issue I had with it was the screen / ghost touch issue, that i hear is fixed in newer ones. If you havent checked out the OPO you are missing out on one of the best phones for the money. There is literally no reason this phone should be as cheap as it is",Good
"Every couple of years I buy this same exact phone for my 80+ yr old grandmother. It's simple and does what a phone is meant to do, make and receive calls.Reason I had to replace the last one was it decided to jump out of her pocket and wash itself in the washing machine...lol",Good
"Finding a study case for this phone was a bit of a beast, but managed to do so. We needed a non-camera phone due to work restrictions and refuse to migrate to Verizon and their horrible customer service only for that. So we found this phone and it really is wonderful. Still working out SIM kinks with AT&T, but it's doing all that we hoped and more!",Good
"I bought the phone for my 17 years old son, had minor scratches in the back barely noticeable, but the functionality has been perfect, is the most important, my son is happy!!",Good
Was dissapointed it didnt come with a cord or wall plug. Not sure if that was stated in the description. It did arrived promptly and works well.,Good
"Replacement for wife's phone of same model that she was very happy with. The sound had started working only when on speaker (not real convenient). This phone seems to be working great, no complaints yet. Verizon was no longer carrying this model and don't feel the need for a smart phone yet.",Good
HTC has been a beautiful job with this phone I'm truly impressed with Beats Audio it's a joy watching a video,Good
"it is better than the optimus one.. on hands feels kinda cheap the plastic is not at all smooth for my taste.PROS: Screen, 1ghz cpu, dual slim, slot for sd card, gingerbread feels fastCONS: is a no, big NO multistasking phone because the low memory ram, the touchscreen is not very responsive.for the price and you want to know what is the ""boom"" about the smarthphones i think is a very good first phone.",Good
"I purchased this for my wife for our anniversary. This is her first Smart Phone and she loves it. She learned how to use it pretty quick and is still learning, T he only reason I did not give it 5 stars is, like every other Smart Phone, it has a faster battery drain (you are not going to go 3 days without a charge) and they do not have as good of a signal reception as our older phones. But, you have to give a little to get a lot. I own a lot of Samsung products and this also is not a disappointment.",Good
"Really nice watch, works well when paired with my galaxy avant. However, I just got it yesterday and the screen cracked. Is there a warranty on this?",Good
"Perfect for an average user, and feels good when held. I find its quick and responsive, and takes out good photos to share with friends and family.",Good
"A very good phone for that price! recommended if you do not have much money, in venezuela dont work with 3g",Good
"Wanted a TALK phone and Nokia has the Power for Towers.User friendly,individual keys. Only drawback...ringer is not loud enough because I work outside on a boat.",Good
I bought this phone for my mother who broke her phone. The sales rep from Verizon wanted to charge her an arm and a leg for a new phone. She had no problems setting up this phone.,Good
I had one and it stopped working. I was glad to find a replacement so I can make it until my contract expires.,Good
THE PHONE WAS GREAT WHEN I BOUGHT IT. SO GREAT SOMEONE STOLE IT SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT . I REALLY WISH I HAD ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT...,Good
"Good phone... It's the international version, which calls for a EU sim before it can be used anywhere else. That said, my T-mobile sim, unlocked, worked here in the US. Mercate group offered some solid customer service too. Will likely improve with more widely available in the US - as early adoption leads to lack of online support for issues.The good: 1. s5 features, in a smaller package. 2. Price. 3. Availability well before US version gets here. 4. Very light and feels great in your hands. 5. Delivery and customer service from seller. 6. No US manufacturer bloat-ware!A few nit-picks - 1. came with kit kat 4.2 and not 4.4. 2. LTE support is supposedly there, but doesn't seem to work very well (limited band, most likely in the US) 3. battery life is terrible (cannot make it throughout the day, with minimal use). 4. screen isn't quite as good as the s5 full-size. 5. uses USB 2.0 as opposed to 3.0 on the full-size s5.",Good
The phone stopped working and I had to spend 50$ in a new battery because the battery didn't worked any more. what a shame!!!(Previous Review: the device works great. If you use a lot of apps who usually demand higher RAM this is not the kind of phone you would like to buy.),Good
"I purchased this phone brand new, I receive it fast and the next day. It was in the original box still sealed. The phone works great but the charger that came with did not work so I had to go out and buy a new one other than that it was a great phone.",Good
Item is good. The only thing is AT&T does will no longer provide 2G network service,Good
"I like the phone, but the calling on it doesn't work properly. I can make calls but I cannot hear the other person and they cannot hear me.",Good
"For the first couple months the phone worked great. It came in the condition advertised and in a very timely manner. However, we've been using it a little over 2 months and have issues with it charging for the 5 weeks; it is getting to the point you have to sit and hold the charger in the slot or the phone won't charge. Did not have this issue with the previous phone, same model.",Good
I really like this phone. Has most all of the amenities as any Samsung. I have had a phone from this brand before and liked it too.,Good
The phone is great. The connection to the ATT network can be problematic at times even when there are cell towers close by.Bought two phones. One updated to Lollipop 5.1 while the other is still using 5.0. Not sure why the delay in updating the Android software in the other phone. Overall very nice phone that could someday earn five stars if service connection problems are addressed.,Good
"This is a very good product. However, it arrived set up in a different language and was extremely difficult for someone like me who is not tech savvy, to figure out how to get it to English. After having to make a trip to my local phone store, which was not close to my home. They were able to figure it out and it is working fine now.",Good
"I have had it for almost two years and it has been a good phone. Iam kinda clumsy and it falls once a month at least and has survived, my 14 month niece likes to play with it and sometimes she drops it. Draw back: it does NOT have a FM radio",Good
The product is great. However it easily flips from English to Korean? language when you are texting. This can be annoying. I think once the language of choice is selected it should be difficult for any other language to be accessed easily.,Good
nice screen size. well buit and sturdy. my 12 y.o is able to go into the android play store download lots of free apps,Good
"This is a basic smartphone, perfect for someone that doesn't have a lot of needs or expectations, someone older or a kid. Great price for the quality.",Good
I've had this about a month now and I really like it. The only negative thing is there is a lot of bloat-ware on it I don't need or want. But the features and performance of the phone is excellent.,Good
I was NOT packed in bubble wrap. So during shipment. The inside were shaking/moving. So far it works well. As advertised. Happy with my order. Thanks!!,Good
entregado en el tiempo indicado ya este se encuentra en mi casillero solo falta revisar el articulo . . .,Good
Much better quality than the 720p version but had a real hard time getting it onto WiFi. Had to direct connection then teach it the network.,Good
make sure you buy drop warranty.. the screen is very fragile.. it will crack even when dropped within 1 feet.,Good
Excellent phone have several frequency technology available that you can shoose.I like the CDMA technology because is really stable.I use the phone with CDMA technology and the phone working very good.,Good
"14yr old loves it, has office on it and she can pull her school work from her laptop up on phone. Very efficient! Does break easily so protective case is a must!",Good
Got this as a replacement for my hubbies phone. Cannot get it to send and receive pictures :( but otherwise works like the other one.,Good
"I'm an iOS user, but found this to be a pretty pleasant experience. In particular, the screen is big and bright and the UI is uncluttered with some of the ""enhancements"" common to other Android vendors. Things that I particularly appreciated:- Worked well in both Laos and Hong Kong (3G sim cards in both places)- OTG support worked like a charm -- used it to download and program small sensors we use for work.- Common services -- Dropbox, Mailbox, Wunderlist -- work beautifully.Recommend this phone for international travelers!",Good
"My iPhone 5 was stolen so this was my replacement. Fit the description, working fine - saved me a few hundred dollars.",Good
I like the Phone the screen was big so i could see it great there was a few problems the phone over heated after about 10mins lost calls like crazy i was upset got a hold of the seller and they made it right it was just one out of maybe 100 that was like that but i would buy from this seller again cause they take care of you if your not happy they called me on a Sunday to take care of the problem and the buttons on it is lg so you dont hit the wrong one with my other phone when i text it takes me a few cause i hit the wrong letter so yes if your thinking about buying this phone go ahead nice phone you can get on the web fast .Thank you,Good
"The phone was exactly as described, in very good shape. It works great, very happy with my purchase",Good
"Nice phone, great value, I was looking for an iphone, but didnt want to pay $300 or $400 for a newer version, so I went with this 3gs. It arrived in like new condition with all the features of the iphone for a much more affordable price.",Good
the phone works good but it was not the color I chose pedi white as in the photo that you offer me to get blue sky from white to blue sky is much difference really was not what I expected or better is not what pedi,Good
"Great phone with a great screen and the dual sim is a nice touch. I live in Canada but travel allot to the the U.S. I have my Canadian provider in sim one and roam mobility in sim two works flawlessly.My only criticism is the location on the usb port which is on the top and would be much better on the bottom, also the only headset that gives a nice sound is one that came with the phone. My monster headset sounds like crap with this phone my bluetooth one works perfectly.All in all for occasional use when travelling very useful probably not a good phone for everyday use.I also like that it runs pure android with no add ons pure android is a real pleasure to use unlike the one that comes with Samsung phones which is overly complicated and junked up.",Good
Samsung Grand Prime. Best Cell Phone I have owned yet. I have never had a bad Samsung product.,Good
"I just got the phone so I don't ""love"" it yet...it has a lot of nice features, quick response...very vibrant colors, takes nice photos. I am pleased with it so far",Good
I'm not a cell phone junkie so this may not interest those that are but if your looking for a good unlocked phone with a keyboard this works great.,Good
"Great deal for the price.. more so if refurbished. Fits great in the hand, good audio performance, great display and an all round package. The only downfall is the battery life. I'm not a heavy user but regardless this battery doesn't last very long. On an average day I have to recharge this phone at least once.. sometimes twice. Leaving home for work with anything less than a full or nearly full battery usually results in battery death before I return. Simple solution is to buy a second battery and battery charger.",Good
I had a very good experience with samsung but the note 4 is a really very good and also a very good battery backup what we need in the mobiles,Good
"Just that battery life, just that! The Phone is great Windows Phone 8 too. But the battery last just like 6 hours when I'm using internet if I don't, like listening music or watching movies it last for ever. Buy it again may be, I guess the 930 or 1520 with a bigger battery are more for the kind of person I am.The camera is great, better pictures, better videos, better software and holding it is awesome!",Good
"I bought this for a friend who lives in Costa Rica, my only complaint is that there are only 3 languages to chooses from and Spanish is not one of them.",Good
It came right on time. It is pretty scratched up but nothing you can't hide under a case. It works fine.,Good
"This is a cheap, but good phone. For someone who wants a simple phone and needs it fast this is the phone. The messaging feature is a little tedious as you have to hit several buttons to send or read a message.",Good
This is for my mom and it does the main purpose of calling/receiving phone calls.,Good
"The phone came without US mms settings but were easily downloaded from the Moto site..It now works great on the ATT network.The phone came with a foreign charger and the wrong US adapter. After contacting Amazon, they immediately sent me the same thing for exchange.I ordered a charger from Ebay and am very happy.The phone is chargable from the mini usb port so I was able to use it until the charger arrived.I would give it a 5 star if not for this problem. Also hope I don't need the warranty.",Good
"Excelente enviÌ_ (RÌÁpido), telÌ©fono en perfecto estado, original esta nuevo. No comparto las 5 estrellas de excelencia porque prefiero esperar a tener algo de tiempo de uso con el telÌ©fono, y si es asÌ_ les darÌ© las 5 estrellas!! Contenta son honestos con lo que estÌÁn ofreciendo.",Good
I hav had this phone for 7 months now and I actually like it. I am not one to like change and of coarse I didn't care for it at first as I learned how to navigate it so I wanted to wait until I understood the phone before posting a review. So the phone is super thin so having a case makes it a comfortable size. The buttons are easy to use. The speaker has decent sound to it and the battery life is just now starting to degrade. The hardest feature is to do a screen shot as it wants to turn the volume up and/or down when trying to complete the screenshot. Another key factor is there is No place to add additional memory and the phone doesn't come apart at all which means you can't get to the battery for anything as it is not able to be taken apart. For these reasons I didn't give the phone 5 stars,Good
Beautiful phone. Arrived on time as promised. Amazon shipped white instead of black but my son LOVES this phone and wants to hold on to it! I've ordered a case to put it in so it will stay clean. Now I want one! :-)!,Good
"Nice smartphone. Fast, really fast, amazing screen, good camera. For the price is an excellent product.",Good
"I have some difficulty writing because letters get mixup and the internal memory is not enough for my use. Yes, I recommend it to my friends.",Good
"the big screen is amazing to watch videos, read articles, send messages and play games. White color is great, its a good looking color. The only negative point on this device is the chrome edges, even if they give to the phone a fancy look, they are too easy to scratch it and little by little you will see more scratches on the edges. Despite of that, the phone is amazing and the quality pictures is incredible.",Good
Great case. The flap for the charger broke off however after a couple of times. I haven't been able to find out if it's a warrantable issue.,Good
"Everything in this phone from the processor, software, camera is great but the outside is very fragile and slippery. Today this phone fell out of my pocket during gym and the side bezel got chipped everywhere. I recommend buying case as soon as you buy this phone and be careful of clumsimess",Good
"I just received the phone. Love the size and it's lightweight. I was able to smoothly sync everything from my previous device. i like the build and quality for the price. I have 4G with family mobile, had no issues with the mms, sms, or the wifi. The camera is decent- a lot to play around with. My biggest complaint is the battery life. I fully charged it and lightly texted my contacts and the battery drained at a rate of one percent a minute!! The speaker is fairly loud but my incoming calls are soft. I would recommend something else if you are a heavy user or just get a better battery. You do get what you pay for...",Good
I had a phone like this one before and it works just fine. I was happy with the price also.,Good
"The case feels comfortable in your hands and it feels like it can protects your phone if you accidentally drop it. However, if you have a full cover screen protector, it makes the corner of your screen filled with bubbles, otherwise, it's a good case.",Good
"Very nice phone, a little smaller than expected but otherwise functions perfectly and maintains a good charge. I enjoyed getting my items in one package. The packaged was wrapped and packed perfectly with great protection. I really appreciate the time and care you put in packing my orders perfectly. Thank you",Good
"The phone as received looked good overall , and worked as well ! Would use Wireless 2 Go again ... Perry",Good
"Bought this for my 66 year-old mother who needs a simple phone to use in an emergency - she said, ""It doesn't have a camera!?""Who knew!!",Good
"The phone was in a great shape, no doubt, but it was said to be new but wasn't. I know this because the battery was not genuine and cannot hold a decent charge.",Good
"Good phone, image and video quality equal to iphone 6But when battery power down to 20% this turns to be hot iron boxNot able to speak without speakerOther than this it is an excellent phone",Good
"Wonderful phone,came on time but the box looks kind of old.The phone and the items in it were new and never used .but it was difficult to connect to my data at first,called at&t and they helped me get connected.apart from that i love this phone.",Good
"IT works well, but I felt that I got better battery life with my other Lumia's. It has solid performance and it does an excellent job as a phone.",Good
"At the price point, its an overly amazing phone with one snag: no virtual reality. There is no software or settings fix for the problem either. I have communicated with Blu about this and they have admitted that there is an issue with their coding in what the DPI is of the device.If they fix this I will update the rating to a 5",Good
"Very good. Clean and untempered. Just that the battery didn't work, guess thats factory default. Overall, amazing.",Good
"I WANT IT BECAUSE MY BABY DESTROY MY RAZR, IT'S JUST THE SAME ONLY THAT IS NOT A FLIP PHONE, SOMETIMES IT'S AN EXTRA, SOMETIMES YOU MISS IT. WATHEVER, IF YOU THINK IT'S BETTER THAN THE RAZR, FORGET IT, KEEP YOURS,",Good
"sorry but I sent the invoice for the product the urgent need, if I send the invoice to the address you return the product. happy day",Good
"It worked perfectly well in Venezuela (Movistar) I just have 3 days with it; maybe later I can tell about the performance. But till now, it works good! It's really nice and I love the design and new features :D",Good
"Great phone, but the instructions leave something to be desired.. that said, the Amazon Q&A section for this phone makes up for lots of the missing documentation. I would definitely buy this phone again.",Good
This is a great phone I bought this brand because I had a AT&T phone made by Huawei for 8 years that still working. I almost let the reviews about the camera turn me away I'm glad I didn't because unless you're a professional photographer you'll think this is a great camera. I would trade for any I phone or Samsung out there well maybe the S7 but nothing less hope this helps those who can't decide.,Good
Worked for a little while until it quit charging. Tried several chargers and none of them will charge the phone.,Good
"This blackberry is a AT&T unlocked phone, not factory unlocked. It does not look new, more like refurbished. I'm not sure if it works in Jamaica where I need it. I'm hoping it does. Shipping was fast.",Good
Sometimes the speaker phone button doesn't work but all else is fine. It's so nice to be able to find exactly what I need in just a few clicks. Thank you for a great quality product at a great price.,Good
"Buyer Beware!!! This phone does not have gorilla glass! After owning it six days I dropped this phone less than a foot from the ground, now the screen is shattered! Now I have to pay Blu $131 dollars to fix it! Other than that its great.",Good
"I really like the Defender cases, but unlike my previous version (iPhone 4 Defender) the outer rubber cover is smoother and easier to mark up. Using the fingerprint reader is fine so long as you setup the fingerprint with the case on because the height of the case slightly interferes with the angle of my thumb. The opening for the rear camera and flash is great and doesn't appear to interfere with taking photos. The ""plugs"" over the sound mute switch, headphone jack, and lightning connector sit flush and don't need massaging to sit flat like my old case. That said, the ""plug"" covering the lightning port is fairly difficult to open, but I'd rather have that than it opening up all the time letting in dust.In summary, my only real complaint is how easy the case is marred with everyday use discoloring the blue to a teal color where the holster rubs the phone during insertion.",Good
Love the phone. I have had no problems with it and the fact that the battery last two weeks before you have to charge it is an excellent feature.,Good
This phone is just what we needed. Our basic old phone was dying and we didn't need a smart phone. Instructions for changing service to the new phone were simple,Good
This product is good for the price although i haven't had it for a long time. it is perfect for my daughter's birthday gift,Good
"It would be a five star but when my dad recieved the charger didn't work so my dad had to buy another charger but so far he says the phone is good . Honestly, I would recommend you but if please check your chargers before shipping them.Overall, it's a great buy.",Good
"While i had some difficulty in understanding that this phone only worked with a select set of service providers, Shopebest was extremely responsive to my need to return the phone. They were very helpful in processing the return transaction, and I greatly appreciate their professional attitude.",Good
"I bought this phone and it came within 2 days...the screen was loose and I had to pay $100 to get it fixed. Other than that, it has been great. Rather big, of course and it's hard to use without bluetooth.",Good
"Quality and functionality of the phone is great, but my huge concern is battery life..this phone's battery starts decreasing as soon as you touch it, battery doesn't last all day, and needs to be on charger by afternoon, is this normal??? Can't be!",Good
"Let me start off by saying this phone is well worth the cash! I was skeptical at first with it being a new phone and a brand I had honestly never heard of but I was wrong. All the features are great, I have yet to have any real problems, the camera is awesome (even the rear facing)! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't get my background or keyboard to stay the theme I want..??",Good
"so far, so good. blu seems to have found a niche for making durable phones with all the bells and whistles comparable to other phones on the market with the highest mark going to its overall affordability. i purchased 3 different blu models most recently available all for considerably less than i could have gotten just one of your more advertised brands available on the market (samsung, lg, motorola etc.) only having the phone a short time now, I'm curious to see how well the phone performs/holds up over time. for my initial review, I'm happy!",Good
The SD card slot doesnt work on my lg g3 dont know if anyone it having the same problem and there isnt any update centre on this device so cant get the latest android version but over all its a good phone,Good
"I needed a replacement phone as I ruined my iPhone 5 last October. The phone arrived in a timely fashion, great appearance, but better yet it has been working flawlessly. Plan to get one for my husband.",Good
I really liked this phone but could not get it to work for me. The return was made very easy.,Good
"For the money, this is a brilliant little phone. It's dual SIM and fully unlocked, so stick the full size SIM in and you're good to go. Internal storage is at a premium, but it takes a SD card up to 32GB and Windows 8.1 allows you to download apps to the SD card. The OS works well with the phone, so it's pretty much lag free. Downside - it's not a Lumina so the version of Windows is slightly crippled. Loading contacts is a pain.While the 512MB of RAM limits gaming apps that can be loaded, most apps work fine. Overall a great phone for someone whose priority is to make calls and message people.",Good
phones come in time have small scratches A cell phone battery does not workbut I think the price is right only suggestion is that the product should indicate the status of cellular,Good
"This phone arrived well packaged but completely without instructions. Not even from where I could obtain them. Fortunately for me I have a computer and was able to search. Huawei have a website from which you can download detailed instructions. Without those instructions, I would be lost.As a phone, it works very well. It has a good screen, though I find it too small for my large fingers and strain eyes trying to read such small print.. Calling numbers is fine as the numbers are quite large but typing is too difficult for me, even using a pen.I have other jelly bean devices for internet so am not really concerned as I bought it as a phone and for that it is good.I found the camera a little disappointing but useful to have available.",Good
"This is a great phone. When I opened the box it appeared that the phone was locked and required some ""unlock codes"". That was not the case.I put a sim card in and it worked right out of the box.",Good
The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the battery cover. Cracked mine removing it the first time. Love the large screen and buttons. Battery life is triple that of my old Casio C811. Even with heavy Web usage still have close to 50% at the end of the day. Camera takes beautiful clear pictures. Set this phone up with Straight Talk with out any issues. Just hope it lives up to its milspec rating.,Good
Although I returned this item I actually liked it. Is easy to use the camera was excellent. colors were brilliant and sharp.It was loaded with apps.which was part of the problem for me.There were built in features that were no where in. the owners manual ! The screen would occasionslly freeze notpermitting either outgoing nor incoming calls.Pop the battery out and back in it worked fine Its such a neat little phone really was reluctant to return it!,Good
"I've had this phone for about a month or so now. I've had no problems at all except one that could be a major deal breaker. For some reason, my SAMSUNG phone isn't compatible with SAMSUNG apps. This is making me feel as if the phone is a fraud. The UI is exactly as a regular s6 edge should be but the fact that i cant download samsung apps like samsung+ or samsung gear is alarming. If this doesn't get fixed i will be returning this item in fear that its fake. Also on the back it has a code in the place of where it should say samsung galaxy s6 edge. It says CE0168 . Most of the s6 edges, including the one i had before this one had the logo instead of this code. This phone is becoming a red flag for me. Looking for some solutions ! If not it will be returned.",Good
"Awesome phone..This is my third blu phone, due to several accidents, that would have damaged any phone. Will buy again.",Good
Love the phone . nice smooth no problems . very light weight . it's is unlocked just wish all the att stuff was taken off ... Seller was quick to respond with questions . seller said scratches on the phone but there wasn't any . 4 stars because usps just handed my package to I e of my kids friends and it took me a day to find it . no signature was required either. Fast shipping,Good
"Very nice phone for the price. Its better than my expectations. The only complaint is that doesn't came with a headphone, and i think they can include a screen protector too.",Good
"It is working, however because it is unloced it would be nice if they either A: rooted the phone, or B: disabled the carrier updates. I keep getting an update notification for t-mobile, but am using it on another carrier.",Good
Had a few problems with OS and had to replace battery after 2 years of use.,Good
The return button has to be pressed hard to go back from a particular menu,Good
"bueno y barato, menejable excelente equipo, lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados, navega bello 3G incomparable al mejor precio, fino",Good
"Bought this for my sister, I ty s a great phone and she's loving. It came on time as well but the only downfall is I though it used the small sim and out doesn't. You van buy am adapter and it will work fine.",Good
Phone is great but headphones were Samsung ones and the two charges stopped working after 1 week,Good
"Great phone. Camera is amazing, but sometimes the software lags. Hopefully software updates sort that out. The fingerprint scanner is BLISTERING fast and 100% accurate. Feels great in the hand, love the 'smaller' form factor and phones less than HUGE are getting hard to find. Battery is what kept me from giving it 5 stars. If you have the money, and want the pure Android experience, go for the 6p. If not, this is a very capable phone and you will love it.",Good
Frist time user of a smart phone and they loved it very much easy to use and product came on time,Good
"Well for one thing i didn't get a new one and when i did get it, it had a very volgure e-mail left on it (rapepornog ) what the rest was i can't remeber, and there was still some chinese writing left on it, i was lucky to get it off, so i really do think ALL THE PHONES SHOOULD BE LOOKED OVER A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY ARE??????????",Good
Phone is nice. Just wish the charger was made for Turkey. They did send an adapter so it could work in the US. Overall pleased with phone but will have to find another Samsung fast charger overseas.,Good
"I didn't order a new phone, it was ""like new"", it came in great packaging and everything with the phone was perfect, I was in love with the phone. The only issue was that when I tried to put in my Family Mobile SIM card the phone couldn't read it (I entered the SIM card into another phone and it worked perfectly so it was definetely the phone). Otherwise, I would've kept the phone. I simply returned it with no problem. I just ordered the Vivo Air, a ""new"" phone that was roughly thee same price as the ""like new"" Life Pure XL, hopefully that will work better.",Good
"This was adequate, it is only G3 which was not what I expected but was in the description so, my bad. Affordable, yes!",Good
"In the past I had this phone and love it so much, I wouldn't have another in it place.",Good
This phone lives up to its name the rock. Very durable and water resistant. Battery life is pretty good as a charge will almost always last at least 24 hours. If you are considering this phone make sure to buy the cradle charger with it. The usb port on the phone tends to fail and makes it seem like the phone will not hold a charge. however with the cradle you do not run into this problem,Good
"The phone works perfectly. The only thing that bothers me is that the screen is broken on the left top. It's about a millimeter, but I don't agree this should be on sale. Just my opinion.",Good
"Fast delivery, Good looking phone, performs well, nice speed, The camera not great and the speaker phone isDelivery was fast. The phone features and performance were better than expected. My only true complaint, is that the speaker phone is not loud enough and the camera was not great.But,it was a Great purchase for under $200.'''''''",Good
"At the end of week one, I have to say that I am pleased with the phone. It does what it is supposed to do, looks good, and is a form factor that I think is a sweat spot. I find it easier to wield than my wife's larger, 5 inch phone. The water-proofing is a good feature, and a key reason I bought the phone other than the size. I do not necessarily like the glass on the back, but I bought it along with a screen protector and a simple case.Pros: water-resistant, speedy, good battery life, expandable memory, nice screen, excellent size and heft, looks good, and updateable to KitKat.Cons: Glass on the back is liable to scratching. The usb port for charging is awkward and the weak point in the phone's design. I immediately ordered a magnetic charger and would say it is a must for this phone.",Good
"The phone came on time, it is exactly as shown. Right now its working quite well. Its a little bit bigger than I thought.",Good
"The NextBit Robin is a very nice sleek phone.Gives you the feel of prestige as it is a phone that is regarded as a new technology. It's extra storage to the cloud really does help as it opens space for photos. It's ability to archive barely used apps and quicky recover them is actually a cool feature.My only issue with the Robin is that it does tend to heat when streaming, browsing and multitasking but can be remedied by not using the phone for a few minutes.Overall it is a really good phone.Video of first fire up[...]",Good
"This phone is NOT compatible with Verizon Backup Assistant software, so be prepared to spend some time re-entering your contacts. Otherwise it works great for the senior it was purchased for: big buttons and screen, easy menus.",Good
"I had one before and loved it but it was time for me to get another one. I couldn't go wrong with the price either, thank you very much. LindaCrooks",Good
"Great phone, easy to use. No problems since i started using it 3 weeks now. Camera takes very nice pics and the video is nice and clear. Much better than the one I had before.",Good
"Yes, it meet my expectation and the phone is what i needed. I didn't get my order the first time but with the help from customer service, i was able to get the phone.",Good
"its good, fast, and cheaper than its similars... i give it 4 out of 5 because ive had a hard time setting it up and managing the settings... to set up the data network, the guy from at&t had to be with tech support for over 30 mins had to create something on the net settings... and some of the notifications are just odd and cant find to change them... however ive only had it for a cupple of weeks and im new with android, hope to figure it out soon",Good
"The problem with this is the verizon actication on it, it denies most of the programs to run eg: a mere internet, but can read email only. It heats up, and the battery never lasts for at least 6hrs, every two to three hours you have charge, very dissapointing though",Good
Love the phone works great only problem I did not receive the charging cable how am I suppose to change my phone,Good
"I have two months using the phone .. could not be more satisfied, is an excellent phone for the pricePros:- acceptable quality camera- slider qwerty keyboard- Browser with Flash Lite 3.1- Good overall quality, very solid- Connection Wi-Fi and 3GCons:- A bit slow on the navigation menu- Battery with very short durationI only see two negative points, so I say that for the price of this equipment is nothing better in the market .... you manage your email accounts and notifies you the arrival of each new message, when you want you can surf the Internet quickly, enter into any sites like YouTube thanks to Flash Lite 3.1, and keeps you connected to social networks (Twitter, Facebook , Hi5 ..)... 100% recommend it for the price.Apologize for any misplaced word or do not understand, I do not speak very good English.Thanks.",Good
"great phone, its versatile and durable. the battery life usage is very good, it last for ten to twelve hours if your browsing and playing music. moreover i can also switch my phone wireless browsing to my laptop while still browsing on my phone.",Good
Exactly what I ordered. I'm not thrilled with the android system. I'll probably get used to it in a couple of months. ***former Windows phone user.,Good
"I bought this for my dad for his birthday. He's a mechanic and, while I wanted to get him a phone made to emphasis durability, my dad wanted something shiny with a big screen.When I first unboxed this phone, I was wary of a few things. The entire back removes from the phone and, when doing so, you get a feeling that you might break the plastic. It comes with a screen protector and rubber case, things which you usually buy separately. Free goodies sounds good, but it made me question the quality of the product even more. Lastly, there's only two android tabs for apps.Despite that, this phone does pack a lot of shine under a low price! The camera, speaker, snappiness of the operation- all are really good. My dad is in no way tech savvy, but he's made a lot of use of his new phone. I might even buy myself one of these in the future!",Good
"Overall good phone. The only issue I have is that the speakers aren't loud enough especially during calls (Loudspeaker only uses bottom speaker). Other that that, phone is great: long battery life (2-3 days) with stamina mode enable, camera is good but not as great as the camera in the Samsung S5, waterproof, magnetic charger as an option, etc.",Good
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",Good
Great blackberry! Very happy I switched back to the Classic for my work phone. Battery life is amazing! I get usually about 1 1/2-2 days of heavy emails/texts/calls. Great call quality as well.,Good
"Does NOT require a data plan which is what we needed. Good phone for simply calls and a full keyboard for texting. Haven't used a lot of the other features yet so cannot comment on camera, MP3, etc. It was pretty much plug and play when we got it a dropped the sim card in. We were off and running in no time at all.",Good
Battery back does not fit well so therefore I think renders it NOT waterproof and it had no memory card.,Good
"Unfortunately i did not received a cell phone with 8 Gb internal memory, it is 4 Gb. For the rest the cell is GREAT.",Good
"Fits the iPhone 5s as expected. Wish it had a little bigger lip on the front so it doesn't come off as easy. Also, open the flap horizontally otherwise the cards fall out.",Good
"The phone operates phenomenally...the smoothest running I've owned to date. However, the screen and ""body"" of the phone are cheap. Of course, I'm sure this is a cost saving measure. The screen, when it bright environments, is hard to see. I have a few dings in the bezel around the screen...with very light usage. Overall, you can't beat the performance of this device, plus the functionality of the dual SIM cards and it being unlocked. I travel a lot and this was one of the deciding factors for this purchase. The battery performance is reasonable as well.",Good
Phone felt nice and looked nice - love the larger screen. Unfortunately I purchased this used and parts were missing so I had to return it. I can't comment on how it works since I did not get to the point of getting it up and running.,Good
This person/company shipped the phone on time and I received it a day earlier than I was promised. The phone was in better condition than I thought it was described as and I have not had one bit of trouble with it. YES I AM A HAPPY AND SATISFIED CAMPER WITH THIS TRANSACTION.,Good
"The screen is big and beautiful. Contact names large and numbers appear too. If you Press the pound key under the 9, it changes from silent mode to vibration. Easy to add names and numbers. If you press multimedia ,you'll find the camera. It's a good basic phone .They can hear your voice clear when talking. No need to have a high volume on the speaker.Text messages are easy to do. It's got F M Radio. It's a good cell phone for the money you pay for. I could not find the volume to raise it up and down the speaker. I have not talk to T Mobile to check if internet can be install. I only put one sim card and not two. It works fine.",Good
"I love it my acquisition its complete, fast, great design, tons of apps and incredibly light. However there are few things you might know it. The batery dies really fast, I feel I gonna break it all the time and after 10 to 20 playing starts to heat.",Good
"Its a very nice phone. It's got a very small and light scratch on the top screen, but not very noticeable especially when the phone is turned on it looks perfect.",Good
The only thing is I did not get a SIM card with it. But it has been a good phone,Good
"Its my third Razr. I don't want to upgrade to a better phone because it takes me too long to learn all the functions. Besides, how can you go wrong with a tough phone like this.",Good
Love this phone. One feature I like most is that it can be used as GPS without having data plan. Just download the map of any country you want into phone and use it as GPS. Remember without data plan it purely works as GPS and it will not show any traffic updates and One feature I did not like is Expandability of Space. You cannot put additional memory card in it. Mine is 16 GB and that's what i need to adjust with.Initially with I bought this phone panoramic was not available but with download of Nokia software now it can be used to take panoramic pictures. Design is modern. So far I did not have issues. As know we may not have as many apps as android but common on day to day life how many do you use ?,Good
"El equipo llego en perfecto estado,funciona bien, el unico inconveniente es que es una version internacional europea y no tiene idioma espaÌ±ol. Lo solucione instalando del market morelocale2 y listo.",Good
Bought it for my mom. She did not like it. After a week of use she won't let go of it.,Good
I love being able to recharge my battery on the go and not need to rely on being next to an outlet all the time. I rely on my phone and always cut it close at the end of the with battery life so I was always it would die on my way home. It is durable but slick which makes it difficult to grip at times. I've dropped it a couple times so far but it's held up great so far. I am terrified however about scratching the screen as there is no screen protector included.,Good
"I love this iphone,but unfortunately it came locked to At&t.I had to unlock it online on At&t website,which took me only a few minutes to get done for free.I did not think it would be that easy to unlock an At&t phone,but it was a very good experience.The phone works good,but it came repackaged with accessories not certified by Apple. Very good Phone,I am enjoying it",Good
"Phones great for the price. Charger didn't work, but found one that did. Its a verizon phone, but There's an option in settings to use gsm unlocked for T-Mobile which did the trick.",Good
"Very good product, a smartphone with the basic purpose to buy (phone handy, small, new technology), although the product is not initially meat, Amazon LLC, the problem resolved immediately by Replacing The application, excellent sales and after sales",Good
"This cell phone is everything it says , a long lifetime battery, a good signal range.. It's A shame that it does not allowed to use whatsapp.",Good
Its ok just never knw it Was that small but i love it it a good phone i love it,Good
"I think the Lumia is a great phone and this one came brand new, unlocked in the box. For some reason, the updated software didn't provide Cortana.",Good
the phone restart too much during operating APP.Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge + Plus G9287 32GB Gold DUOS Factory Unlocked GSM - DUAL SIM - International Version no warranty,Good
Everything worked out great but phone was too slow sometimes.l had used up the memory card it came with so good idea to buy an extra one. But fast shipment n good customer service.,Good
It was sad the only reason I bough it was to stream my disney movies at that time you could only do it with an IPhone,Good
"We liked it , it was awesome, still looked new gonna use it for 5-10 more years before buy an upgrade version.",Good
It works great. It has a large selection of apps. I get two days of use between charges. I wish the screen was in HD.,Good
The phone was nice and all.but the camera had poor quality and nobody makes good waterproof cases for these pbones.,Good
"It is very light phone, so light it's not really handy. The phone feels like a toy from fast food kids combos. However, it worked good, sound quality was surprisingly clear and loud, battery lasted for couple days. I used it in UK, on Tesco network, no issues whatsoever. It did not work in Latvia, on Zelta Zivtina network, had to borrow Latvian phone. I don't know why, maybe something to do with standards. Over all, decent travel or backup phone, but I'm gonna buy unlocked smartphone for my next trips.",Good
"LOOOOVE it -- cool new features like swipe (keyboard), Nokia drive seems to have gotten its act together on the version on this phone too , thin, sleek, etcOne con --- it's too fragile..despite being in a protective case (not sure if its the case's shortcoming or the phone's designs) I dropped it one week into owning it, and though the crack was ever so light and slight and resembled more a scratch on the front glass, it ended up rendering my touch panel right at th ebottom where the back.search,home buttons are :( -- so that I needed to reboot my machine only to switch out of an app or context and get back to the home screen :(but I am keeping it and am looking forward to getting it back from repair.",Good
"This phone works with Cricket Wireless. Because I only have 1 SIM card, there is a permanent icon that says no SIM card in slot 1. But, It works great.",Good
"The craftmanship and attention to detail on this phone is top notch. As illustrated by other reviews, Meego is a delight to use; however, the lack.of apps and support makes the phone restricted and narrows its allure.",Good
Love my HTC A9 onlu issue i Have is that the battery doesn't last very long but hey it charges quickly so that can be overlooked.,Good
Overall its a pretty good phone. before this I was with virgin and had the optimus slider which I liked. The problem with this phone is there tons of junk on it and i can't figure out how to root it. But if I can root it and get all the crap off this phone is great. Anyone have ideas on how to root?,Good
"I have had my phone for a month now, I have dropped it several times due to my clumsiness. Very durable and strong. Simple and nothing fancy.",Good
"It is a little old school at first glance. Then you open it and it is like WOW! The keys are not tiny whch works well with nails. It is a little heavier than what I am use to, but well worth it. Reception is great, Over all, I am very pleased!",Good
"For a basic phone, this is perfect. Doesn't require data, so the price is definitely right.",Good
"This is a very complete design, it have everything wifi, bluetooth and a very good 3G conectivity. The battery it's very good and it's a very strong design.",Good
"I just got the phone today so it may be a little too soon to post a review. However, it didn't take me long to fall in love with the camera and video quality and settings. They are most impressive. What is not impressive is the ridiculous amount of At&t bloatware. The seller advertised this phone as an UNLOCKED phone, not an At&t unlocked phone. There is a difference. I will update my review in a few months to let you know if the bloatware affects the functionality at all. If it does not, then I will give it the full 5 stars.",Good
I didn't used it I bought it for my son and he like it so I'm pleased!,Good
"It works good just like an iPhone should the only weird thing is that the brightness will either turn up by itself (I've watched the bar move) or it dims itself all the way.It was a day late but that was bc the post guy was being lazy, I stood outside and waited. Instead of brining the box over (20 ft) he left a pink slip, by the time I got to the street he drove away.",Good
"The Asus Zenfone is a great phone in general. Many consider it a budget phone because of its price, but it runs as great as newly released Androids and has larger capacity and a faster processor than a IPhone. Plus its pretty dang big. The pictures are nice too. The only con is that it slows down when your battery is low I'm talking less than 5%. Other than that its a really good phone. (Yes, you can face swap with Snapchat)",Good
Phone came in brand new as advertised. I had bought it for my younger brother and he loves it.,Good
phone was fine and company people were great had to return because im on att and phone was for verizon but it was no problem will shop this company again,Good
Nicer and bigger than I expected compared to other cellphones I had. I would really recommend it to my friends.,Good
The phone came in a timely matter and in the condition it was displayed. It was in full working condition with no scratches or cracks. I am still using the phone and love it!,Good
I like this phone!!! its real great and easy to use! the buttons are real easy to use and its a qick phone!,Good
"I purchased this phone for my granddaughter (14) who needed more memory. So far, so good! She is very pleased with it. It arrived as promised with everything in the box. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that we've only had it a week.",Good
"I like lg phone but battery not that great sand I am not on it all the time ,should got lg3 Cox two weeks later I found lg3 the same price that I paid for the lg2, ugh",Good
Wasn't sure I'd like the Windows phone but am really happy with my choice. The price was very good and received it quickly.,Good
"Pretty nice I've had this phone for a monthå_ and the quality of it is really nice. I thought it was going to be kinda laggy but it been perfect for me so far. Only issue is u can't create your own photo album, all album are set up and u can't change them and everyone keeps mistaking it for an iPhone",Good
"All of my kids use the same phone--this particular LG Neon. They especially like the slide out Qwerty keyboard. The battery life is very good. After a year's use, one of the phones had an issue with not being able to receive picture messages. Another reviewer here had the answer: Do a master reset using the pass code 0000. Doing so did not lose any data, and the phone has worked perfectly ever since.",Good
"I""ve only had this phone for a week, but so far it has been pretty close to perfect, I am impressed. The reason for my review is to let others know that if you buy a silicon case for the galaxy note 2 it fits this phone perfectly. I know there is a lot of buzz about cases for the blu phones. Hope this helps someone!",Good
The phone works fine and great but I have a big question. Will it ever upgrade to marshmallow 6.1?,Good
good but charging in not for long time very shortly down other vice very superb phone,Good
I really like the sleek design of this case. The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the card section has nothing to secure the cards. I have opened it twince and had my card fall out. It would be nice if there were some small tabs just to keep them from slipping out so easily. I would still recommend this to a friend but I would advise them to be careful when opening the back.,Good
"Battery can last ten days depending on usage. Love that I can leave it in car and charge every week instead of every day. Fit and finish is exquisite. It has two sim cards for my cellular providers, ATT and Tmobile. Only downside is the speaker volume, when it rings it's hard to hear even on loudest setting, and the speaker phone requires a super quiet environment, like library or morgue or church, places where no loud noises are allowed. Forget using the speakerphone at a restaurant or other noise environment. Very satisfied with item.",Good
"My grandson likes this phone but it does not have a memory card so that he can download games. I would not have purchased this phone the ad had stated this. Other than that, I would given this purchase 5 stars. My grandson is 9 years old and this phone is rugged enough for his kind of rough treatment.o",Good
buena noches quisiera saber si me levanta 3G PARA LAS OPERADORAS DE MOVITAR VENEZUELA DIGITEL O MOVILNET ESPERO RESPUESTAS GRACIAS.,Good
"It's been three months since I got this phone. My only complaint is battery life is low...but otherwise, this phone is beautiful. It came quickly, looked like new , and is just wonderful.",Good
Excellent for what I wanted. Only rated it as a 4 star because of the limited ring tones and message alert tones. Other than that - love it!,Good
"Purchased New. With Standard Shipping this item was received ahead of time. For the price this is a quality product. Worked well internationally with GSM sim. Touch screen works seamlessly & the phone is light weight(includes camera, Video,Bluetooth, email, IM, Qwerty keypad etc). Battery also seems good thus far.I recommend this product to anyone.",Good
"Fast shipping. Seller uses express courier to ship to Ìfrica. Nice phone as Well.It can use any simcard wcda or GSM. Large screen phone, cÌ¢mera is ok. Battery is ok if not using wireless application or if use low screen brightness.",Good
"I like it so far. But I have a concern : my package was sealed but inner cover was broken, might be due to mis-handling.",Good
"Nice solid phone. So far its working perfectly. Hopefully it will continue to perform properly. Just a bit of advice. When you open the box find the nearest ""dumpster"" and deposit the User Manual in it as its worthless just like their website.",Good
"it's a pretty great phone, good performance. The only thing is 3G Doesn't work in my Country. I live in Venezuela and for some reason it doesn't get the 3G network. Pretty bad for me.",Good
"I bought this fone mainly bec of its low price as an android and wifi feature. I didnt want to sign up for extra data plans. So far im happy with it. Works well with my carrier. Connects to wifi pretty fast. Has had no issues with lagging or the screen freezing when browsing the internet. Downloads apps using wifi with no problem. Has you tube in it already when i got it so that was a plus. Battery life is not that good. I had to charge it everyday. But i downloaded an app to save battery life but didnt make much of a difference. With its 2.8 inch screen size, texting or typing was a bit challenging esp since i hve medium-size fingers. Call quality is good, though. I actually like its design, very sleek.Overall, a nice small fone with lots of features and capabilities.",Good
"It is a good phone, a little confusing at first but is easy to use once you get the hang of it.",Good
The camera is pretty good i can't complain :) ill buy another one soon for my friends daughter.,Good
"It is a good phone that take excellent pics, the problem I had with it was that it runs hot at times. I had it less than a week and it shuts down and wouldn't come on. Not sure if that is the case with all. If not good phone to have.",Good
Got as a replacement phone so works pretty well. Camera take excellent /nice pictures. Easy to use an adjust to. Overall great phone if trying 2 replace a phone. I would recommend,Good
"Good and fast.It did not work berry good with T mobile,but is working perfect with AT&T I love it.",Good
Its not perfect at any one area but its very well rounded. The battery could last a bit longer but much better than the original. The laser makes a big difference too. Pictures come out very nice.,Good
Great phone for a great price...bought it for my 12 year old who texts and calls but doesn't need a data package...2008 but brand new out of the box. Great purchase!,Good
Phone is great for thet. price it was purchased at and the use I have planned for it. I would this item again if it was needed.,Good
"This Otter Box is the best phone case, hands down. I am a phone dropper. The Otterbox Defender Series has helped keep my phones in tact for many years. I am happy to see that you get the product for significantly cheaper on Amazon then in the Verizon store. I saved more than half price for the same product/protection.",Good
This cellphone it's very awesome...I feel very happy with that buy...I upgraded to Symbian Belle as recommended by the Nokia Suite and has greater potential still...Highly recommended ...Congratulations!!!,Good
"The phone works good. Super fast and I love the large amount of memory that I have. It took awhile for AT&T to get the Sun Card to work at first it didn't work. My LTE doesn't work, I live in Dallas Texas Area so that is upsetting why I'm going to give it 4 stars.",Good
"a good phone, works well . I would have given 5 but the volume button on the side is easy to lower the volume, especially with the elderly ; and this is who this phone is for. Other than this one drawback the phone has many good features and works well.",Good
It is a good phone on its own if you were using a Verizon carrier. But is isn't the best if you have a different carrier.,Good
"So far so good, this phone works great, capacitive screen is very responsive and you have a full qwerty keyboard if your not into the whole type on screen thing. Only issue with this phone is when speaking with on it on your ear, your ear somehow manages to press either the hold button or the mute button, hence the 4 star rating.",Good
"I did not keep this phone. Instead, I gave to a friend and she is very satisfied with it. A good buy!!",Good
"This is a good size smartphone (think about watching movie on it!). There is a good, comfortable weight on it that is just right when you hold it. It does not feel like a toy. This is a replacement for your tablet really, plus it is first and foremost a telephone. This has two places to mount your sim card as this is an unlocked international phone. If you are going overseas, you could have your US sim card so you could keep in touch while on US soil and have the other sim card for the place you are going to already in place and activated before you even leave. This phone's bands cover Europe, Asia, South America, etc. anywhere you go as long as you have the sim card for where you want to go. Other thoughts: A company based in Florida sells a sim card that does not expire and is truly international. It even include a US phone number.",Good
"Very nice phone My son loved it , has a very long battery life, easy to use option to use the slider or the front keyboard which is great!",Good
"Happy with my new phone, I got what was shown on the site. Only wish Verizon would not go back on my old rate plan that forced me to have to buy a new phone. Amazon & the retailer that sold this item were just great.",Good
"This phone is great for it price. I couldn't import my contacts from my icloud account. You can find a lots of applications which require you to have access to virtually your entire information. When on Internet connection, the phone is very fast. I recommend this phone for anyone who do not want to spend fortune buying ""a brand names"" that have same function as this. I'm enjoying it so far. I have had it for more than two months now.",Good
"es buen telÌ©fono no he tenido problemas con el, es rÌÁpido, lo recomiendo, solo un pequeÌ±o detalle que la baterÌ_a dura poco tiempo.",Good
"I love the size of this phone, it's about the size of an iPhone SE. It feels very durable in build quality, very solid. It has a smooth scratch resistant screen (corning gorilla glass). Built in kickstand is a nice touch. 8mp rear camera is surprisingly good even by todays standards. Battery is easily replaceable. 1GB Ram 16GB Storage. I can't believe the original MSRP price was $550!This is a cool little phone but you can't upgrade from android gingerbread which might turn some buyers away.Also make sure you verify that the phone can be activated & has a clean IMEI or ESN before purchase! The phone I ended up getting was still activated & I couldn't use it on Sprints network without sellers pass-code. Thanks to Amazon I got a refund for it! :)",Good
"Bought it to replace the one I dropped, still my favorite phone but this one is a bit glitchy",Good
Great little Android phone packed with features. Paid less than $40.00 for a perfect refurbished phone that is still a contender.,Good
"I recently bought this phone as a non-contract upgrade after my iPhone 5 was run over...fun, fun right? I had heard good and bad things about Blackberry and had wanted to try one out for myself so I decided to go with the Q10 and boy am I glad that I did! I love having the full QWERTY physical keyboard which feels better in my hands. Without sounding too much like a salesperson for Blackberry (which I am not) I loved everything about the phone except a little bit of the screen size. Given I know Blackberry is not known for large screens for videos and games, but it took a little adjusting to. That is the only reason as to why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. The OS has worked seamlessly for me and has not glitched out or anything. The App World can be a little scarce, but there are ways around that if you know what you are doing. All in all, this is a great phone that I will be very happy to keep on using for the next couple of years.",Good
"Can't beat it for the money. Fully functional and more. Most importantly , I never have to take my phone out of my pocket to check my texts. That alone makes it worth the money.",Good
"I like this phone. You get good value for your money. It is not too fancy, but it works. I was positively surprised. Only downsides I can think of are that the camera is not great, and the earplugs not very comfortable (and u can use your own, but they function as antennae for the radio). But other than that, Im really happy with it. Im sure its nothing compared to the new iphone, but if you just want a nice phone with touchscreen to download nice android apps, and use wifi, and which works in both the US and Europe, for a good price; this is a good choice.",Good
We've never bought phones online before and this phone was a really good deal. We like HTC and are still getting used to the Droid.,Good
Came set in Spanish...took me a while to figure out how to set it to English since I can read Spanish. Otherwise nice phone,Good
"The phone it's ok, I recieved in perfect conditions.One thing you want to know is the battery life it's about 30 hours, you have to charge every day.The touch screen its good on response, it takes some time until you can do every thing, but it's not a problemUnloked phone you can use with any operator.",Good
"I am not able yo setup mobile hotspot, does att have anything with it? So good so far for the rest",Good
Its good just don't have much space in it .Other then that it works fine,Good
i like the phone but the back keeps falling off I think the bttery is swollen,Good
"Gotta say that if you want a brand new phone both in and out including the packing and charging adapter ,get it from the official place, not here. But if you want a g3 that is fully functional and phone it self is brand new not charger and so on, buy it here. The phone is perfect,I think it is bearly touched, but it is open-boxed, and the box is not the origional once( i got a white version and it came with a gold opened box which looked old and a korea version charger. The phone is brand new american version, supposed to be brand new as i think at this point. So phone itself is perfect. The other details, meh......after all its the phone that matters. I guess the 70 bucks short for a reason. Dispite that, this is perfect. Ps: I do think this is the best android phone out there u can buy. Will u notice the difference of 4k display? Yes u will. Nothin is better. Hope this helps your desicion making. Peace",Good
"I love this cell phone, it has everything I need and saves me a lot of time having to go to the office to pick up my e mails.",Good
"The phone works fine, with iOS 9.3.5 however the 4s is sluggish to keep up with opening apps, google maps for instance does take longer to load, overall it's a little slow, but it all works. The screen does have a yellow hue to it, its not a crisp clear color. I also can't get the idea out of my head that this refurbished phone has proprietary spyware installed to monitor calls, texts and photos, to activate the camera and microphone, pretty much access anything on the phone. It didn't come with an official Apple refurbish phone certification, just came in a bag.The refurbished 4s is a great deal, I'm just paranoid thinking there's a catch.",Good
"I just switched from iPhone 5 to Sony Xperia zip Z3 Compact. So far, I'm very satisfied with my decision because the Xperia Z3 Compact. The phone is really easy to use and fast. I just think that the camera is not very good in showing the details in the image. However, I still recommend this phone to everyone because it has the same performance of the latest phones with low price.",Good
"This was a replacement phone for my original one I got wet. I like this one as much as the first one. One odd quirk about it, the speaker sometimes comes on at the start of a call?? This happened on my first one also. I wait until the call connects, then ""slide"" the speaker ""off"" on the touch screen. Still haven't figured out why it comes on in the first place.",Good
"I have had a couple of androids, including an optimus g and galexie 3, and this phone works as well as any of those. The only draw back is the lack of accessories.",Good
"This is an unlocked, international version of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge phone. Do not be alarmed when you read the package instructions that it must be activated in a country other than the one in which you reside. The instructions for my phone indicated that I needed to first use the phone in a Southeast Asian country, but I went to the local AT&T store to get a new SIM card (because this phone requires a smaller SIM card than my previous Nexus 5), and the phone worked in the U.S. immediately.I thought that I would use the ""edge"" notifications a lot more than I do. In fact, I find that I wish I had purchased the flat-screen Samsung Galaxy S6 instead. That said, I'm quite pleased with the performance of this phone.",Good
"Good phone great specs, the battery though isn't that strong despite charging to full before use or maybe its just mine. Doesn't come with an earpiece either. The front camera makes the face big, kinda overzoomed.",Good
"Only complaint is that it won't let you play music and apps at the same time. Besides that great price, and great pictures.",Good
"I purchased this phone roughly 4 months ago, and software wise worked completely fine. However, the backing of the phone is very very smooth and hard to get a good grip on even with the case it comes with. The case that the phone comes with is very flimsy and doesn't serve much protection, and being that it is hard to find a proper case, after about two weeks the phone slipped out my back pocket and the screen cracked (with the case on, but I didn't have the screen protector on it). As a result of the phone being so smooth it actually fell out of my back pocket and into the toilet. Other than my own faults the phone worked very well and I didn't have many problems.",Good
Great phone overall. Like the slim bezels. It dose lag a bit specialy with Facebook messenger,Good
purchased this iPhone for my daughter as a replacement for her stolen one shipping was fast the price was great phone works great i have nothing bad to say,Good
"The cellphone overheats a lot specially when playing games i had to remove the sillicon protector and still heat goes up to 50cå¼, other than that everything else its OK.Battery life its good 24hrs for light use although gmaps consumes a lot, recommend desabling GPS if dont needed.Delivery was OK, 2 day shipping on time.",Good
"Shipping was fast and the price was fair. Only issue was battery, but the phone itself was otherwise pretty awesome.",Good
"I really like this phone. The screen is beautiful! The rear camera is excellent! The whole thing is very zippy.The downside is that average real use is only about 14-18 hours on a full charge. You MUST plug it in every night or it will be dead in the morning. If you had a particularly full day of cellular data use, I think the above numbers would be halved down to 7-9 hours.",Good
"I purchased this phone about a year ago for $199.99. Since then, the price has dropped a bit. However this is an amazing phone. Perfect for light use. The screen is clear and the features are amazing. The stylus however, is just a simple one and sometimes doesn't work as well. But the price makes up for that.Overall, this is a beautiful looking phone with amazing features at a great price. The downside is the storage ( only 8gb of which you only get to use about 4).",Good
"I love this case, worth the price and very sturdy. Only thing is it picks up dirt and there's really no way to get it off. It kind of reminds me of an eraser with pencil marks on it.",Good
"This phone watch is awesome, I would definately recommend buying it...the shipping was long but it was worth the wait my baby loves it...",Good
The don't have french language where you can change it french that's my problem I have with this phone.,Good
"Phone works fine, but I am a bit worried about the screen death problem (which I heard about after I had ordered the phone). The screen is nice and large, but that causes increased phone size. This thing is BIG and pretty heavy. Does not fit well in any of my pockets. I did not know what I was buying, so cannot fault the phone for that. Check things out well before buying.",Good
I got the phone in March and the phone has been hot to touch only once. I like the phone except I wish there was more internal space and not a lot of excess apps that are pre installed. The pre-installed apps can't be removed and they take up a lot of space.,Good
"Great phone for the money, more than meets my needs. Only complaint is bloatware, particularly the constant Amazon adds.",Good
all the features are like a regular nokia phone and i have only ever used nokia phones so i have had no issues getting used to it.my only complaint is that the numerical keypad is a bit cramped. otherwise everything works perfectly.,Good
I needed a phone that was rugged and can hold up under humidity and cement floors. This is the phone I was looking for. This is a basic phone that will hold up when you need it.,Good
"Overall the phone is great. But there are a few problems. Firstly the screen cracked easily. Secondly the Beats earbuds' logo came off on the head of the earbuds. I don't know how, when or why. Thirdly the phone over heats easily but that is not really a big deal. I found it weird when I received the package, the phone was taped outside of the HTC box in bubble wrap in the postal box. A case came in the HTC box and it doesn't even fit the phone properly. The phone is great but I don't know why I have all these problems. I am a bit disappointed and confused.",Good
Wrote a review that phone would not download ringtones. Well it won't but it is not the sellers fault. Too many trips to the Verizon store (what a waste of time) then on the phone with Verizon (better than store). This phone since an upgrade was not performed before February 2011 can not be upgraded without special download software that no Verizon store has in our state! Cell lounge has been very helpful with trying to get this resolved. It can't and they are giving us a full refund. I would recommend Cell Lounge to all. The 4 star rating is for the phone only!!! They get a 5 Plus Plus!,Good
"The phone does not come in the original box packing, but the phone was absolutely new, untouched and with all accessories.I have been using over 2 weeks now and it is working fine like a new phone.Battery backup is also good with 40 - 50% left at the end of the day after moderate use.At 99$ it was a steal!!",Good
"EXCELENTES CONDICIONES Y MUY BUEN FUNCIONAMIENTO, ME AGRADA EL PRODUCTO, RECOMENDADO PARA MANTENERSE COMUNICADO, DE MUY RAPIDO PROCESAMIENTO Y ENVIO DE SMS Y OTROS",Good
Good phone... Battery in good shape (lasts about 20 hours between charges)... Works as expected. No complaints,Good
"THE SELLER WAS VERY NICE, I LOVE ALL THE COLOURFUL FACE, THE CAMERA TAKES GOOD PICTURES AND WINDOWS 8 WAS FAST, THE ONLY PROBLEM I ENCOUTER WAS I COULDN'T TRANSFER MY PICTURES TO MY LAP TOP. SO I RETURNED IT, THE SELLER WAS NICE TO REFUND MY MONEY",Good
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY SON. IT WORKS GREAT AND PURCHASED AT A GREAT PRICE. WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS.,Good
It works and looks great. It I have had to reboot it twice now for a black screen,Good
"Great, durable case, but it gets dirty fast and doesn't look very pleasing after a few weeks. For durability though, my phone bouces when it's dropped. Protects the phone well.",Good
"I do like this phone, was expecting it to process faster....seems a bit faster than my iPhone 5, but not a huge difference",Good
The phone is nice and everything is easy to read but the receiver is on the back of the phone. When I grasp the phone my hand seems to cover the receiver and it becomes hard to understand me. It sounds like I am in an echo and muffled.,Good
"3G it work perfect for Movistar in Venezuela. I just can be able to used the pin service. A error message appears """"Device is not registered""",Good
returned the phone because there are no ATT towers in my area; check before buying,Good
Product came quickly and as described! Was very pleased with the overall purchase that I bought 2 more. Great service!,Good
"It's a basic ""Slider"", does what its supposed to do and still is doing just that. My husband loves it.",Good
"just what i was looking for, great for my husband, not very good with i-phone. great price and customer service was outstanding , would order from them again",Good
"It'seems great!,, I got it as a birthday gift for my best friend. She loves it! So it'should better than expec6",Good
"Messrs, despite receiving the phone out of the date indicated is in very good condition without defect works very well and fits my needs.Greetings ....",Good
So far so good. Buttons are stiff to push but are getting easier to use and type.,Good
"Ive had this phone for about 7 months now, so I can honestly say its pretty good! There are some speaker problems I got with mine, but it DID come unlocked as advertised. I have MetroPCS so the sim I got was put in with ease and within five minutes the iPhone was hooked up into the network. Would definitely buy again!",Good
"Great phone, although I didn't get it to work with my ATT SIM card. The company is in China and very difficult to work with ! Be certain this phone is for you because the refund procedure is difficult and hard.Also, the Chinese symbols from the Chinese carrier are annoying and don't go away when English is chosen as language.",Good
The screen protector that it came with was really hard to navigate my phone with. I ended up cutting off the plastic screen and just using the rest of the case.,Good
It is a very good team. I recommend it 100%. I have not filed faults is of high quality. Good.,Good
"Excellent device great form fit, finger print scanner is quick, front facing speaker works well. Definitely met expectations.",Good
"Phone works wells, but had to get a new charger as the phone heated up with the one that came with it. Overall good product.",Good
i loved phone while i had it but didnt have front facing camera so i sold it to get new one and i was able to resale phone for same price i bought it so has good resale value.,Good
"Excellent phone for less than $200. The build quality is great, screen is good (720p), OS is near stock Android Lollipop, included a good quality case that is textured on the back to provide a better grip, screen protector and headphones (so-so, but free!).A few issues that prevent it from being a solid 5/5:If you've installed a launcher and reboot the device, it will load the stock launcher instead and you'll have to select the default launcher again.GPS has failed once before trying to navigate. A reboot fixed that issue.Also, my usage is pretty minimal (no games) Mainly streaming music, text, web browsing and I average about 7 hours on a single charge. Longest I have used the phone was about 12 hours.I'm on Cricket in the DFW area and I get LTE.",Good
"Overall I'm really happy. I brought this unlocked AT&T phone over to Straight Talk under the BYOP program and for the most part, no issues. BUT, I did have one big problem upgrading from Kit Kat to Lollipop. The update kept failing and I had to bring it into Best Buy to get it to update. Now it solved other issues I was having (like it kept forgetting wifi passwords), but now its having GPS tracking problems. Also there is a lot of AT&T bloatware on this thing. My advice: Don't upgrade. Root, flash a custom rom that you like and get rid of all the bloatware.I've dropped this a bunch of times and the only thing that broke so far is the Samsung memory card (still pissed Samsung is dragging their butt with their warranty claim on this one).",Good
id like to purchase another one but blackberry doesnt support a lot of app..but it ok it works very fast,Good
I bought this blue accessory phone cover to go along with the phone that i purchased and it worked out perfectly.,Good
this is pretty damn good phone. I like the size and quality and price and etc.however simcard doesn't fit well. maybe it's simcard problem though. but beside that everything is good,Good
"This dual SIM phone is good. I used it internationally and it was ok. What I didn't like about it was the virtual keypad, not easy to navigate",Good
"Phone does what it is supposed to do. Camera is fair. at 1/10th of the cost of my broken Iphone, it is a bargain.",Good
"It meets the expectations, it's just faster than the S3 mini. It's a good purchase considering the price, works fine in Venezuela",Good
"el articulo llego tal cual el anuncio del vendedor, el envio fue rapido lo recomiendo muy bueno. excelente producto. gracias",Good
"The cellphone is great. It's stylish and I love the camera. It has a weird ""mode"" call ""beautification"" which pretty much will work for selfie lovers. The only thing that really lacks some quality is the audio. The speaker is in the bottom and it's not really that loud or clear. If you listen to a lot of audio I would recommend you to look for other phone. I have been using it for two weeks now and I can say that most of the time will work great. Instagram and Facebook stop working sometime, but I don't know if it's the app or the system. For 199$ I'm really happy.",Good
"Good phone, and because it is an unlocked smart phone, I can go to any carrier I choose. The best things is that this phone has a removable battery, so that when the battery starts to not hold a charge, all I have to do is order another battery. Buying Unlock Smartphones with removable battery is the wave of the future of the smart consumer. I urge others to free themselves as well.",Good
"So far this is an excellent phone. This my 2nd purchase for unlocked phones from Amazon and they're pretty good! All features work great. 2 batteries, spare case, working charger and new phone straight out the box. Put my T-mobile sim and input sum of my passwords and it all came along....just like a Galaxy Note but a few differences but not really noticable. I will say be careful finding accessories for Foreign phones becuz they aren't many available. My only issues is that i have have to get another memory card becuz none of my GooglePlay downloads will come thru becuz my current Memory card has a few items on it. But other than that, this was a GREAT purchase!!!!",Good
I bought this phone for my daughter to enable me to keep in contact with a child who has recently moved out of the house but had lost her phone. She seems to be pleased with some of the newer features.,Good
"In my search for a new phone, my main interest is to work on a 3G network in the band 2100. Because this phone is not doing ... not pass the letter EI try with other operators and shows H +I feel cheated",Good
"It exceeds my expectations, upgrading to windows 10 from 8.1 was a walk in the park.",Good
"Nice, although the cover is so lisa that difficults a secure handling. At least in comparison with my old Xperia S",Good
the phone is nice it works for all the reason I need it for it a phone u need to get use to,Good
"Refurbished at&t phone received in very good condition. I'm not sure if the battery is the original, but the charger is cheap generic 500 mAh.When connecting the phone to the wifi, immediately it got windows phone upgrades to version 8.1. Good hardware, interesting operating system. As I had read in reviews, some poor performance battery (1650 mAh).Currently operating in LTE 1800 (Digitel Venezuelan carrier)",Good
"Comes with a pretty cool charger case. I can confirm that it will work with LG G4 (Tmobile Brown Leather Version). I've noticed that the battery life of the G4 has improved slightly. Nothing crazy, but the battery life of the G4 has never been the greatest. you should also check the actual LG website for the battery before you consider this one (It was slightly cheaper).",Good
"Fantastic phone, only issue was that I received a white G2 instead of the advertised black. Otherwise great",Good
"The phone is ok, I expect a litlle bit more, for the especifications, but there is something missing...I don't know,",Good
"I wanted a basic phone for the purpose of being able to make calls. I have found that the battery lasts for days before needing a charge. Have been able to access cell service in many rural areas with this phone that I had no access to with a prior phone. Call volume is excellent. It was unlocked and I had no problems with my AT&T account or service after inserting my SIM card.I would highly recommend this phone to those in search of something other than a smartphone.Doc, from Ohio",Good
"So far we love this. Got it for my 8 year old son and it's been some work setting it up, but the reviews here made it much faster. I got the Pure Talk monthly plan and the sim card was perfect. My only complaint so far, is that with this model there are no lights to indicate charging status so I can't tell when it's charged. I asked about that here so hopefully another user will be able to enlighten me. I love the mode options and the fact that my son can't text or get distracted by a touch or digital screen. He loves it and so far the calls have been clear. I will update my review after we've had more time with it.",Good
"The cell phone is amazing,the only low point,is the battery..if you really use it,you won't reach the whole day...you will need a power bank,yes or yes my friend!",Good
"I love this phone but don't like the case, it looks feminine lol. I would give it 5 stars if the camera was a little better. It's a great camera but I'm used to my iPhone excellency. Overall it's a great phone I recommend it but not to people with small hands , the size is like a iPhone 6+.",Good
"As with most international phones, language conversion can produce a slight hiccup in some aspects of text and voice. Nearly all modes can function in US English by simply going into language settings and selecting the appropriate language. My phone appears to have been designed for the French market. Its language function has been changed to US English with the exception of the drive mode which still produces text and voice announcements in French. I downloaded the higher quality US language file from Samsung, but the drive mode still produces French chatter. A scouring of You Tube for solutions was no help. I have contacted Mega Mobile (the phone distributer) to find out if they have a solution. However, the phone is beautiful and is heads and shoulders above my previous phone. If the drive mode language is hardwired into the phone, maybe that will spur me to learn a new language.",Good
This is a great all-round phone. I liked buying it online at Amazon because I could take my time and do some real comparison shopping before I made my choice.,Good
"Phone was delivered promptly. I was worried that phone may be used or wouldn't connect with Verizon. Phone appears to be new and I had no problems connecting with Verizon. I have issues with several apps, but I don't consider that the seller's fault. Phone won't download entire I-tunes library and the maps doesn't have a voice feature. .",Good
"it is an amazing device. Everything works perfectly, an amazing camera. However, the battery runs out really fast. I used to recharge it twice a day. But I have realized that battery lifetime is a huge problem for all types of device nowadays, regardless of the brand. So, I am satisfied with the galaxy S6.",Good
To sum it up for you in comparison to ANY OTHER PHONEPros:it looks good and it worksCons:needs an external backup battery to last through a work dayneeds protector caseneeds screen protectorneeds money for apps monopolistmy old phone didn't need any of that,Good
"It is a good phone, however we need to update software now b/c it will power cycle. It is really nice to have a Symbian phone, great camera and video and it is really easy to send video's (under 300 mb) to people.",Good
Great Phone for great price!! the specs speak by themselves. The only con is the Nokia market place and The terrible software support microsoft gives to their phones. but HTC apps helps a little.,Good
I had brought it for my friend. As far I do understand he's surprise what this Smartphone can do. The world is in his hand. A very value gift.,Good
"It's my first tablet (phablet) and it is little old, slow. But, I can always learn and find a use for it. Price was right. I haven't activated the phone yet, it's a GMS network phone and I'm still exploring providers. Somebody told me SEARS sold this make and model. It might be acting slow because the mobile data isn't activated yet. Happy.",Good
Replaced wife's Samsung with this phone after she laid her old phone on a wet counter top and ruined it.She promptly dropped this one in the toilet but it still works! Can't beat that.,Good
A lot of the apps don't work and the bluetooth doesn't show things on you car like song names. Needs some kind of update for apps. But great otherwise. Better deal than I phone.The camera is nice...,Good
"The LG Kp500 is a very nice phone. I like the design and look of the phone. I love the fact that the phone lets you do multiple things at one time and has an mP3 player. The only problem i have had with the phone is that sometimes it runs slow. i have learned that the less you have on the external memory, the better it runs. i dont know why that is though. i definately like the touch screen. But the headphones that come with the phone are not comfortable. I do reccomend this phone.",Good
It's an elegant phone. I just don't like where the camera button is located. I'm constantly pressing it by accident.,Good
The phone is obviously refurbished - (little to noscratches) not a big deal to me because It will be used as a secondary phone.,Good
"I bought this phone because I wanted an Android phone with a resistant sreen and this phone has Gorilla glass that is so resistant and antiscratch, it also has a front and back camera, and works well in my country El Salvador, the Wifi is great and I can watch You Tube videos with no interference or delay. The only thing is that it has a lot of Apps Factory preloaded and I don't use much of them and affects the memory and the internal storage space. I read that it is possible to root the phone so those Apps can be deleted but I haven't try that. Thank you.",Good
"Well built, only complaint is its weight, it's a lot heavier than my old case but it is a more protective case",Good
Great phone. Very fast and extremely durable. I dropped it almost immediately after taking it out of the box. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the speaker volume. It's not as loud as I would like it to be and a bit tinny.,Good
"Good but not great phone. If you're looking for a phone with great quality, save your money on this and look for another one. Satisfaction is not as big as it is. It doesn't come with accessories. It arrived in good condition, though.",Good
"there was no 2 GB microSD card !!!! also no headphones, but the phone is perfect.i'm giving 4 star for this cheat :)",Good
"On the small screen as a pioneer of the samsung galaxy could not ask for more, functional, durable and beautiful, I recommend 100% reliable supplier.",Good
Phone is great. Improvement on the speakers are needed though. Aside from that good phone at a good price,Good
Its Big! Nice and light. both front( and rear) facing camera for Skype. The only thing I don't like is its not stock android.,Good
The only think I don't like you send me the Cheapest usb cord n no earpod other than that everything look good n perfect,Good
"I love this phone, it has a great screen its fast, it hasnt crashed on me, the camera is great, the resolution is also very good, the fingerprint lock is also a great add on, the only problem Ive had is that when I go to Mexico my data roaming doenst work, and I though it was my provider but it seems its not, I've changed the apn, network, roaming and sim settings but that has not worked",Good
"The phone itself is fine, does about everything it supposed to do. My only complain comes with the memory department, its just to small. I dont have that many apps on the phone and im allready getting memory warnings. I've had to erase several not vital apps in order to have enough space for the vital apps. So thats why the minus one star. Overall good phone to start with if you are a noob with Android system. Would recomend? YES.",Good
"Chose phone for my 99 year old mother. Easy to use and large, easy to read screen. Volume isn't as loud as previous Verizon phone though.",Good
I just got this phone from amazon and im very impressedi was expecting a cheap phone for what i pay $130 dollarsand got something way better!!!,Good
"Had a little issue at first but once that was sorted out, it worked fine, Good phone for a decent price, had no problems with it. would recommend.",Good
"As a budget phone costing less than 150 bucks, I would say it certainly meets my expectations, hardware-wise. The level of satisfaction on the software side, however, is less than awesome. The phone is preloaded with a bunch of bulky & useless T-mobile bloatwares, which present a huge burden to its miserably little RAM. It took me a while to root the phone and remove pretty much every single one of those bloatwares. Since then the phone has performed great.",Good
Great phone for the price. The one drawback is that fitted protective cases for this phone do not exist.,Good
Everything works fine just found it weird that none of the instructions were in English and neither was the phone settings.,Good
"It a LG G3 phone with 32GB of storage. Works well. This is the T-mobile version running KitKat; personally I did not have a good experience with the OTA lollipop version that T-mobile pushed down and I reinstalled Kitkat. Actually the lollipop version was quite bad (messed up apps, 50% reduction in battery life, loss of various functions, more messy stuff ) and I do not expect to install that or a later version until I see T-mobile is actually testing the update for what was a flagship phone.",Good
"I was both surprised, and happy with the structure of this case. It works so well with the security of the phone. Although I have yet to test that theory. The price was awesome.There was no surprise in when it was to arrive. The seller made it clear up front, so you had the option to buy it or not.I love the color, and people keep telling me how much they like it as well.If you don't mind the wait, it is worth it.",Good
A Christmas present for one of my daughters - the pickiest of my children. She seems to love it. I cannot deal with typing on the touch screen. But she is a convert. Good value-for-money.,Good
The phone is easy to use. One thing I didnt get the sd card that surpose to come with the card.,Good
"Very advance phone when it was released in Dec. 2010 ... But now in 2012 , networks started to have hogher data speeds and this phone has a data speed limit of around 7 mbit/sec ... Which is the max of most 3G networks . And the modern trend nowadays is the 4G speeds.. If you need something faster in data go with the Galaxy SII or better....Screen is excellen with vivd colors and sharp details...simply Samsung qualityBuild quality is very goodDevice speed and responsiveness is OK but not mind blowing fast !! especially nowadyasCamera is excellent for a cell phone both in stil pic or videosApps compatibility is very good..Most apps would workHas the potential to have all the new updates cause it's a Google deviceWill work only with T Mobile 3G data (NOT AT&T) but can make calls OK with any GSM networkThat's pretty much it..Thanks",Good
"Works pretty well with my office SIP phone and using Cisco Anyconnect to connect to my office VPN. Now it's like I'm actually in the office but actually my home office. Don't know why there's no setting for ""allow incoming sip messages from sip proxy only"" to prevent ghost calls.",Good
"Great phone for the price, I got it on Cyber Monday deal. the camera and display are outstanding. Also, the touch interface seems smoother and faster (couldn't exactly get the right word) than other phones. The only issue is the battery life. They have fixed that in S7 I guess.",Good
"I had a smart phone and just don't like all the added distractions. Of course, when I wanted to go back to my Octane, I couldn't find it. I ordered this one and it is perfect!!!",Good
"This phone is awesome! Does crazy things, durable, sleek looking, and works like a charm. The only issue I have is the battery life..it only last about 2 hours but for only $5.00 on here you can find the HCT extended battery and let me say, it is AWESOME! makes this phone perfect! It really is worth buying, I personally think its better than the Iphone!",Good
"I keep on discovery this phone's capabilities. I bought a 32GB sim card for music files. To make it easy, just go to Google Palay and tap on the Icon. Download Synctunes for $4.99, follow the instructions and e-mail yourself once you open the Synctunes so you can download the program in your desktop. With the USB cable included with the phone, you can Sync your iTunes music into the phone. It's a hoot, you can play you music library while driving using the same type of connector you use on your MP3.Enjoy!",Good
The phone arrived. Relatively on time. The only reason this phone does not get a 5 star rating is because the the earplug port is somewhat faulty. The earphones that came with the phone are nicely styled. But only one bud wants to work properly. I ended up buying another set of earphones. Thinking this would help. It does to some extent but it turns out. We are having to put the plug at a certain spot at the port for both earplugs to work. This is not a total deal breaker for him. Everyday he says. I love it. I love it. The size becomes a second thought after handling the phone for a while. Anyway. So far so good,Good
"I got this in the mail today. I've been messing around with it all afternoon. It took a few minutes to figure out how everything worked, and I was worried the back cover wasn't going to stay shut, but it finally shut and stayed that way after using some force. Texting is very easy on the Qwerty keyboard. I'm very pleased with it so far.",Good
This phone is awesome ‰Û_DisplayCameraSpeedVery nice phone to use and most of the common apps available now in Windows,Good
"Working OK on tmobile in USA. VERY limited space for apps. This is a good phone for somebody who mostly needs a phone.It is small enough you won't feel stupid hauling around a smartphone, just for calls.",Good
The phone works great. The back was a little hard to take off plus when I purchased it I thought it took a SD card but it does not . The speaker is pretty loud for in home use. Would buy again,Good
"Decent low cost world travel dual sim card GSM/3G Android cell phone for everyday light users. Don't expect to push it with only 512MB of RAM, but for everyday use, or world travel, this is a nice sized device with lots of features. The battery can last you for a very long time, and overall its a decent purchase. Make sure you need this model as it has quad band GSM coverage for world travel, but only 850/1900 Mhz 3G coverage for North America.",Good
My husband love this phone I got it for Valentine's day it is his first smart phone hes a mechanic and is ruff with his phones and so far its held out wonderfully id rate a 5 star but it has some flaws over all though good phone,Good
The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is simply because it is still kinda bulky and makes holding the phone with one hand harder than it already is.I'm sure it will protect my phone very well it just doesn't feel very comfortable in hand.,Good
very nice experience and the phone was all it was advertised to be. I am very happy with my experience.,Good
I like the phone. the OS was great and the phone came in good condition. Only problem I'm havin is that the phone randomly stopped getting notification and ringing sound and only vibrates and its not on the vibrate settings,Good
"Screen protector didn't fit right, it was loose and don't allow for easy touch. Had to remove it and by new screen protector.",Good
"It's not a great phone. It is, however, a great phone for the price. Full LTE speeds on T-Mobile plus hotspot capability is exactly what was advertised, and exactly what I got.It does crash out of memory-intensive apps without explanation fairly often. Other than that, it's pretty good.",Good
a very capable cell phone with enough bells and whistles to keep your teenage daughters from disowning you.No data;),Good
Came with a UK plug only. None for the US electrical outlet. Love the phone otherwise.,Good
I got my phone yesterday and so far so good no problem at all will update review later stay posted but I'm enjoying it so far,Good
"I like it. It's a good device. It's extremely hard to find any details, cases, or reviews of this phone. It literally slipped under everyone's radar and that's a shame. It's a very decent phone. The picture quality of the camera is decent indoors but exceptional with enough light. Night shots aren't bad either. The phone overall feels snappy. I spent a bit more and got the 2 gb of ram and 16 gb of storage and I'm glad I did. The 720 display is bright and nice. Has a DPI of 320 so everything looks sharp. I don't game but I do a lot of social media and I watch a lot of videos. The battery could be better but I'm able to get through a day with moderate usage. I like it. I just wish I could find a better looking case.",Good
Great phone. Using on Att no contract plan. Bought 2 phones. Both work well. 4 and not 5 stars given because a). Difficult to find a case other than the flimsy cheap plastic ones. b). Speakers are not great and does not sound loud. Not a good phone if you like to use the speaker while talking or for music or in meetings. c). Settings are limited for allowing notifications of emails and SMS and apps.I plan to continue buying blu products. Great alternative phone.,Good
"The phone is good. You can't set up your account entirely on line. It involves a couple of calls to customer service. The buttons and screen are easy to see. I bought it for better call sound, but it isn't any better than my other cheap phone. Plans are cheap but voice mail is extra and you can't send even one text message without adding a texting package.",Good
"I would have liked to see the 4g option. Otherwise, it's on awesome phone, absolutely beautiful device, and is priced right. Keep up the great work BLU. Way to go on shaking up the competition!Reporting from, Corbett Lantis, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.",Good
I wanna give it a good 4.8 the only one issue with it was a very small dent on the upper right hand corner but nothing that would ever bother me. Overall the phone works perfectly and I'd like to thank you for the product. Keep making the people happy (:,Good
The product was great and really it was new one!Absolutely new with cover and great price for the product..Thanks..:-),Good
"There's a learning curve from the 3-G, but it is fast and has a good screen. Once acclimated, it is very user friendly.",Good
"it is just what we expected. Very nice and confortable to use.The only problems they have is that they get a bit hot when you talk,but in general they are very good Cel Phones. These days you can not getnew flip phone models, so this is one of the best left before the dissapear for good.",Good
"I have small hands, but most of these days cell phones are big screen and heavy weight except Iphone 6. I prefer Android, so I order this cell phone. Actually, my first z3c was suddenly broken. Immediately, I refund the first, and I reorder my second z3c. That's the evidence of how much I love this phone.",Good
"My Haven was stolen. This is a replacement. It cost less than a new phone from Verizon, even though I was eligible for an upgrade; and it works with the inductive charger from my old phone, something the new basic phones don't. However, I was disappointed that it won't download my contacts from Verizon. My stolen phone had somehow uploaded them; I vaguely remember something called V Cast that isn't on this phone. Other than that, it looks like a new phone, works fine, and has features I don't think my old phone had.",Good
I recived my case today and immediately called the company after installing my Otterbox and noticing the way the screen protector is raised above my screen. They are sending me a new one! My mom has a pink on purchased from Walmart and she has no problems with hers I was hopeful that mine would be prefect aswell but I see it was not. But other than that I feel this case is just a good as the one I had on my galaxy S5.,Good
"I searched for quite some time for a new phone. Read many many reviews. I chose this phone and I'm pleased with my purchase. My phone arrived a day earlier than expected. Set up was super simple. Took about 5 minutes. I have straight talk for service. Was able to sync my phone to my car easily. Battery life is great, phone is a little larger in size than I like but I'm getting used to it. So far I am very happy with my new phone. I was using the iPhone 4, so getting used to an android takes a little getting used to but overall I would purchase another blu phone. It'd only been a week if any issues I will update my review.",Good
"My first Nokia broke when it vibrated off my kitchen counter but I had to replace it because I LOVE this phone. It survived several falls before that with ease, has a great camera and has both great touchscreen technology and buttons to push. The nice perk is that I can operate the touchscreen with my gloves on. I also like that I'm not locked into a data plan like with smartphones.",Good
"Great phone, is fast, has a good camera, has the android market, is very responsive, great audio when you have headphones in. The only downfall it has is that it heats up to fast",Good
"Ordered 3 of these for myself and family members. Definitely an upgrade from our previous phones. Light, thin, and fast enough for me. Price is right for something pretty close to flagship specs. It does intend to get a bit hot on the back so I just put a case on it. Previous reviews for the press kits pointed that out with the snapdragon 615, but other than that I have no regrets about picking up this phone.Update: August 2nd, 2015. One out of three phones that I ordered just crapped out. LOL. Guess I just had bad luck. Everything was working fine then all of a sudden just started rebooting in a loop. Even did a factory reset and same issue. Definitely a hardware issue. Oh wells. Calling the Manufacturer monday :/",Good
"Phone just as describbed, shipping pachaging could have been better. The phone box was opened and looked used. However, no issues thus far.",Good
"The apple Iphone 5c in blue, has been my go to phone for the past year. I absolutely love the lightweight feel, and the ease of carry.However without a case this phone is very easily broken. I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go. Also according to my seventeen year old brother, it is a great starting phone.I'd Highly recommend.",Good
"If you compare this phone to the iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s, they would all have a few wins, losses and draws. But at the end this phone would win.",Good
"this phone is good it just take FOREVER to ship , other than that i love this phone yall should but it",Good
"Pretty good phone, needs more memory and camera could take better pics inside a dark place, (come out grainy), but does everything I want it to and more once I got all my apps and customized it. Though will be upgrading to the 920 to get the 32GB memory. Definitely like that I could upgrade to 8.1 windows!! All came packaged well and arrived quickly. No problems getting it working with AT&T, already unlocked, no problems at all. Just the 8GB is very withholding when it comes to all my pics and videos I want to have on my phone!!Does anyone know if I can get a new mini sd card or memory card, whatever they're called to upgrade the amount of memory in my phone!! I just get keep getting told I'm running out of space on my sd card and when I transfer it to my phone I run out of space there too!! And how big of an sd card can I get/upgrade to on my phone for more memory if I can? Thx for any help!!",Good
Price dropped two weeks after I bought this but the phone seems like a nice solid device. I'm using this with Google fi and the 16GB seems to be enough for me. I would like a SD slot but that isn't an option with these phones.,Good
"Great phone, but loaded with ATT bloat ware. Don't know if T Mobile version (851) is any less trashed, but I do know updating Android with unlocked T-Mobile lg g3 doesn't require update pushed by carrier, so the D851 would be more versatile. Battery life short, this device is an energy hog...but extra batteries are cheap, so is a minor problem.",Good
"I love this case because it turns my fragile galaxy note 10.1 (2012) into a beast. I am not sure how I feel about the built in screen protector though. I use my note for taking notes in class, the s-pen is a critical reason for me buying the note in the first place. I am worried that the screen protector may cause note taking to be more difficult.This is a great case.",Good
"A nice entry phone made by DOOGEE, a good amount of the 8GB is left to the user and this is a fully fitted dual sim phone. Meaning you get two sim slots AND an sd card slot. No hybrid slots here to chose one or the other. My only grievance would be lack of clear instructions for theme changes that I know should be in the device, but thats fixed with a download from the playstore.",Good
"The phone was as described, and the delivery was accurate. My grandson says the phone was like new, and we didn't not have any problems with the activation at Sprint.",Good
The only comment is that the Manual came in a language that I could not read any of the words there... probably Russian or some other country close of there...,Good
"I have my 9780 since august, I can say it is a great phone. The battery life is great, I charge it once every 3 or 2 and a half days. I don't know why 3G is not working, I expect is a providers problem.If you want a BB with great features, buy a 9780.",Good
"I like Android. I particularly like that it is open, rather than proprietary.OK, first, this phone is far superior to the one I had been using. It does indeed allow me to use it as a communications device, as a camera and as a computer. It is, however, handicapped by the inclusion of a lot of useless software I can't get rid of, proprietary stuff Samsung loves to inflict on everybody. They are probably very proud of the 'extras' they provide. That pride is not justified. I would be happier with a plain, functioning Android system with no extra applications forced on me.",Good
I love this case! It was so cute when it was brand new but only 4 stars because it gets dirty easily and wont come clean. I know a few other people who have this exact case with the same problem. I guess next time I will know to get a darker color case.,Good
"Nice phone, just as expected. Almost stock Android with a couple nice extra features... Battery life not that great but ok.",Good
phone is awesome but charger adapter was broken. It didn't charge my phone but the 2.0 usb wire itself worked fine.,Good
I like this smartphone because it does anything I need at very acceptable cost. I had a bad experience with another smartphone (not a Samsung) that I end up returning after less than 3 weeks. My son that already had a Samsung suggested to me to get this one; I am happy with it and I would recommend it to a friend.,Good
"I love my Moto G, mine was bought off the Amazon Warehouse but it arrived in mint condition, save for the box which was pretty beaten as stated. The phone, despite being a 2013 model still holds up pretty well to most current devices, Motorola was pretty clever designing this model, while processor specs are way below what other flagships offer, the architecture makes it seem like you have high end phone, 0 lag or stuttering whatsoever.My favorite part is that you get pure stock vanilla Android, BUT BEWARE the AT&T contains a little bloatware and as of 05/2015 cannot be safely rooted.The camera is the only letdown here, pretty mediocre (considering the specs), but the again I already knew that and didn't buy it for its camera, it covers my needs well enough.It's 2015 and this is a great price/quality alternative for everyone looking to get a quality device for at a budget pricepoint.",Good
"Good not great. The camera is definitely the weak link with the phone. I love the twist of the wrist to activate the camera but the camera itself doesn't take great pictures unless you have ideal lighting. I haven't taken advantage of the Google Now features. I am sure they are nice but I haven't found a need for them(like I thought I might). I like the size of the phone a lot. Other phones in my price range were bigger and I didn't like that. For my price point this phone is great, but if money were no object I would probably opt for a spendy iphone just because of the camera. I don't require my phone to change the world with all its super powers but I do want to capture some good photos.",Good
"Excellent phone, I just wish it had all the band's of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones, and Samsung pay wish it had but I know because it's international it couldn't, but we'll made. :)",Good

I just got the phone today! Blackberry 9780 Unlocked! It appears new! I put my sim card from by 9810 Torch seems to work fine! I have a Digicel sim card and put that in the phone and that past the test! I actually got the phone to use in Jamaica and the Caribbean! I may use it in the States too after all it's unlocked! I would buy another one!,Good
"This phone is totally bangin and it worked perfectly for my mpcs sim card, just can't send nor receive pictures or other forms of multimedia. The front camera is very low on brightness too, other than that I love it!!",Good
OMG? Why i cannot use any cellular of T-mobile on this phone ? 2g? it's supposed to be 4g?,Good
"Phone came in great condition, looks brand new! Activated without problems and is the 32gb as ordered. Came in the box with the charger and headphones. Snapchat is acting a little funny and the emoji keyboard but other than that no problems at all. Verizon said I got a great deal!",Good
"Our third one.. First one drowned, second one got dropped toooo much. This one with the protective skin has survived a few three foot drops already. I read the reviews and have not had the problems with this phone yet. I did notice after our second one dropped and cracked the hard cover, the battery was loosely connected and would shut off once in a while when handled right. Simple fix to reinsert the battery.It is easy to use and understand. My wife tried a smart phone for a couple of weeks and then requested this one. She loves the looks and keypad. It's the right size for her small purse too.",Good
After being a happy android user for years I decided to make the switch to this phone. I am very happy with the build quality. The screen is bigger than my nexus 4 with nice color,Good

"El telefono lo compre para mi prima y le encanto, sus funcionalidades muy buenas, ahora ya lo vendio a buen precio y se compro otro... lo unico malo el caja del envio muy pero muy grande para el tamaÌ±o del celular...",Good
"The phone is good, but somehow it was not what I wanted. Cosmos Wireless worked with me without getting angry, obnoxious or demanding. I did end up buying another phone from them. It's not the product, it's me. I guess I am so much into my old phone, no other one can compare!",Good
"Bought this Android to serve as a thirteen year old's first smart phone. Purchases a Cricket SIMS card and loaded, works great with Cricket service. Everything and then some for a very reasonable price. Seems to take nice pictures. Only thing we are struggling with is finding a nice, protective case that will allow easy use of side buttons.",Good
Love my new phone. It was Quick lighting speed in the mail!!!!! Fantastic service! It does everything I need it to do. And tons more. Fabulous camera! !!!!!,Good
"This is a pretty good phone. The phone sound quality is very good. The touch screen works well. Once in a while the touch screen takes a few seconds to become responsive. When turning from ""phone style"" touch screen to full key touch screen; once in a while I have to turn the phone on it's side (turning it is the normal procedure) and give it a little shake. The video and still camera both work well. The battery life is about average. The phone is typically on stand by or used for texting and the battery will last for 3 days. I have not used any of the internet features, so I can't comment on them.I would buy this phone again...",Good
What a great value! This phone easily matches the performance of my Galaxy Note 5 and costs $600 less. It looks great and is very responsive. I can't believe how thin and lite it is. It fits well in the hand and the cameras work great alth I ugh low light performance could be better. The almost stock Android look is nice. The fact thay Blu includes all he accessories including a case and screen protector is a nice bonus. Only flaw is to use the SD storage you have to go from nanotechnology SIM to micro SIM card.,Good
"How much do I love this phone? I could have paid double what I paid for it and still think that I got a great deal! One word of caution however, read and follow the instruction manual to maximize enjoyment. Also, battery life could be better.",Good
"I bought this phone because I wanted a cheap replacement for my broken phone till I am eligible for upgrade.Pros:This phone is ultra thin - unbelievably thin. It has just the basic stuff one needs from a phone. No useless additional frills that most of us never use. You can make calls, see time, use it as alarm clock - thats it.Talk time is really long - power saving features like e-ink.Cons:The interface is ancient.The address book is very hard to maintain and use.Messaging is very hard - even to take small notes.End of the day, I couldn't use this phone. It was too ancient for me (I am 25). I found it really hard to put my 250 contacts in it, take small notes etc. So I swapped it with my husband. He is a computer science professor. And he TOTALLY LOVES it! He is very proud of this phone - its simplicity, talk time, power saving using e-ink etc. This phone does exactly what he wants from a phone - BTW, he has 4 people on his address book.",Good
"Pretty good phone so far. It's big just like I wanted good back camera, front camera not too good unless in good lighting. Easy to make calls text. Only thing getting I don't like is how the screen is kind of slow other than that it's a good phone.",Good
"Un muy buen equipo, el Ì¼nico inconveniente fue al instalar el skype, no fue sencillo y hay que hacerlo varias veces.",Good
"Phone is real nice especially considering the price. Runs smooth with nice big screen. Would give it 5 stars if I could put lollipop on it. Doesn't seem to be many accessories available for it, but it does comes with a case. I'm sure the nexus 6 is nicer but not 3 times nicer.",Good
"I replaced my old HTC Incredible with newer version, loved my old phone. Only thing I would change is size, liked size of old one.",Good
"Got this case for my fiance's iPhone 6 plus. It fits perfectly and functions well, however he said it was 4/5 stars because he would like the option of a ""Kentucky blue"" Otterbox defender case.",Good
"I likeso far I can say that I agree, it is fast and has good features.complications had to load some email accounts (since the Samsung customer service people told me that it was not possible to load this type of account, look on my own and discovered how to achieve it).the camera is very good excellent",Good

"I have been testing the Galaxy Y and it's a decent entry level android phone for $125.Pros:- Camera- Android 2.3 Gingerbread (have not heard of any update to ICS 4.x)- Full functioning Google play market for apps.- SD slot that takes up to 32 gb (I am testing with 8gb)- Wifi and bluetooth- Good battery life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use.Neutral:- Okay specs for a budget phone. Has 832MHz CPU.- Okay call quality.Cons:- Small size with - 3.0 ins- Low resolution screen 240 by 320- No front-facing camera for video conferencingOverall, a decent entry android phone for the price. Would definitely be a winner for $99. If there may be the slightest reason to use a dual sim phone then I would suggest you check out the dual sim version of this phoneåÊSamsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102 Android Dual SIM Quadband Unlocked",Good
"My Dad still uses this cell phone, however the speaker is a bit worn out. Sometimes you barely hear the other peoplein the other line. But overall it is a good phone.",Good
Does what I need it to do. The item I got was CLEARLY a refurb despite being advertised as new (but whatever.) The screen resolution leaves a lot to be desired.,Good
"Bought this for wifey and it does what it should, has good speed, easy to navigate thru and use. Will need to add an app for ring tones, as the ones that come installed with it are minimal. We use StraitTalk on it with no problems.",Good
Its fast and takes great pictures... So far it all works great... My husband likes the phone!!,Good
"Received phone within time period; works well with my bluetooth. Only problem is the camera. Images are not as clear as my other phone, but will suffice for my needs. Easy to operate and would probably purchase again if necessary.",Good
"I really loved this phone but it was a company phone so i couldn't put my email into it. I had to refund it, 4 stars because the selller was easy to work with.",Good
"This Phone is Awesome. Fast, Big Screen, Big Memory. I set it up on Straight Talk using AT&T SIM Card. Works Great.Would have been 5 Star But The BLU Software gives the App Screen a Blurred Look. The Wallpaper on the Lock Screen is Beautiful until you flip the Apps up. Then Blurred Look on the Wallpaper. Can't Find any setting to Change this. Other Than that Great Phone.",Good
"Phone not what I was looking for ,swapping for another phone, customer service was awesome in working with me",Good
"The purchase of equipment and transfer to the proper destination in total agreement with no problem at all, besides the computer works great. The only thing I would advise is that the characteristics of the equipment he placed the bands which is team is open, because depending on that, for example here in Venezuela some phone work for that company for telecommunications and other banking work for another company and depending on that would lift the 3G phone or not, for other well. pleased",Good
"I like it, but samsung pay and live broadcast don't work on this international version.",Good
My new evo 4g arrived here in time thanks to Amazon:) the phone works like new but my front camera didn't work. Besides that it works fine!,Good
"this is really worth all its money and more. excellent service when contacted about arrival of item,i ordered it for my cousin he does'nt want to put it down",Good
Good Phone For The Money But Speaker Sounds Like A Megaphone Talking Through A Cheese Cloth,Good
Great product. Wish the ear piece sound quality was clearer and the vibrate intensity was a bit stronger. On a work site where there is alot of noise these two things matter significantly. A bit more memory would help or the ability to store and use apps on/from the memory card.,Good
"The phone is great but there are two things that I was concerning about:1. I ordered G920F and the seller sent me G920FD which is actually the dual sim version and I don't know if that is the better option.2. When I turned on the phone, the battery was on 38% and for less than an hour of use the battery drained.",Good
"This is my first phone, and I like it. The design is nice, and the interface is user-friendly. The keyboard's keys are a little flat, but it's fine once I got used to it. The processor isn't as fast as what you would find in the latest smartphones, but it runs all of my apps fine.I've had a few issues with it though. At first, my phone sometimes rebooted a few minutes after shutting it down. This was fixed with an update. Sometimes the lock screen will freeze, making it impossible for me to unlock the phone. However, I've found that I can hold down the power button and use the arrow keys on keyboard to shut the phone down and reboot it.",Good
Charger and cable look like cheap Chinese knockoffs. Phone works as expected and I don't have any issues after 2 weeks of use. Not bad for refurbished. Worked fine with T-mobile service.,Good
"My husband and I ordered this phone for our daughter for Christmas. We use Verizon, but the phone cost quite a bit less here than if we'd gone through Verizon. So far, everything is working well and my daughter is really happy with the phone.The phone came with ear buds, a charger, and a sim card. We took everything into Verizon and let them set up the phone and switch over her number. I was relieved to know there weren't any problems as I was a little hesitant to order a phone online.The only issue we had was the phone was stuck on the ""slide to upgrade"" screen when we first turned it on. We couldn't get past that screen. This makes me wonder if the phone was returned at some point, but it does look brand new. I found a way to fix the problem online, but in the end we just let the experienced people at Verizon take care of it.",Good
"This Sony phone was purchased as a gift so when I received it, I checked it out and thought it looked like an amazing phone for the money and it was definitely unlocked which was a large part of why I selected it.",Good
"The phone is great and my wife has been using it for several months. However, I have been chatting or on the phone with Total Wireless (TotalWireless) 3 times in the past 24 hours because the phone was unable to make or receive calls. Texting and data continued to work.After the 3rd call, the TW help said the phone is not compatible. They only support verizon phones (verizon carrier locked) or phones from TW.I am going to switch to Straightalk (ATT?) and see how that works.",Good
"I bought the phone so I can use overseas and it worked. Also its easy for my mom to use, and the price is good.",Good
"Sits comfortably in hand, does what you expect a windows device to do, takes good pictures at its price point. My only complaint is that the physical buttons feel like they're built on cheap hinges and are loose. The coloring is fantastic. I wish the camera weren't set into the plastic. Sits well in my medium sized hand, but definitely not a one-hand device.Because this is an international phone, it does not work well on the cell networks here. My LTE speeds, as measured on a Lumia 1020 and this Lumia 930 side by side, on Cricket's (AT&T's) ""LTE"" yielded the following results: 5.5/1.0 mbps on the 1020 versus 1.75/0.75 mbps on the International 930. This is fine for me, helps me use less high speed data...",Good
this watch is gorgeous a little bulky but i promise i wont matter i would give it a 5 but no camera . dont be skeptical like me jus buy it,Good
"Screen is bright and clear, battery last about a day (could be better). Don't care for the built in apps from T-Mobile, but had no choice in the matter.",Good
"Use this phone as an overseas phone and it works fine. If you use other Samsung Galaxy phones this will be no problems. As a matter of fact, if you use any other Android phone this will be fine. It does not have a lot of memory so if you use lots of apps, this may not be the phone for you. The screen is somewhat smaller than some of the other Galaxies but still is not bad. Battery life is average. Small enough for your front jeans pocket.",Good
It was okey buy still frost while using it..its only good for your handsfree calls for bluthooth,Good
"The phone has exceeded all of my expectations in terms of speed, features and camera quality. I recommend this phone to my friends",Good
Its ok i like it at the beggining but all of the sudden it went to guest mode I try to take it off and their is no button for that I called Blu company and they don't have the answer to how to take it off the only thing the told me is to factory reset which that's their problem they manufacture it they should know how to take it off other than that it's OK phone,Good
I bought this for my girlfriend and she just loves it. It works without any problems. Only thing I wish I would have done is buy a screen protector.,Good
"La compra fue muy efectiva, con rapidez y todo se hizo segun lo acordado, el unico detalle es que el celular no tiene operativo el windows market para este pais o region (Venezuela).",Good
The phone is a good phone bit I got a 2900 battery instead of 3000,Good
"The phone is good, but it didn't bring me the handset. So, for that reason i give it four stars",Good
I've had the phone a few days now and personally really wishing I hadn't updated the software. For anyone that has updated to lollipop and notice the battery sucks that is why. I've noticed a big difference in battery life since I updated. Lollopop is good for draining it quickly and the knock on feature isn't as responsive since the update. Other than that the phone looks great. It does come with loads of att apps and bloatware. If only there were a good way to roll back to kit kat I would be thrilled!!,Good
Am rather impress with this phone it came in its original package and working very good,Good
Got this for a present but my older brother couldn't figure it out...was passed on the the 27 yr old nephew...Probably better to wait forwatch 2....Great shipping and price was about same as Apple store.,Good
"Nice and working well, only problem is the hotspot that doesnt accept and gives an error, but the phone is nice and I like it",Good
I purchased this phone to use in Trinidad because it is dual sim and rugged. Works well thus far. Only disappointment is the camera. Very low quality pics. Otherwise it's great.,Good
Phone worked very good in US. But when i came to India phone did not worked. It's asking unlock code.,Good
I chose this rating because I like itThe phone was cheap but useableI recommend this to people with cellphoneUnderstanding.,Good
"Does just about everything a smart phone does without the expense of adding a data plan. My son loves it and I feel that it was worth my money. He can listen to music, take pictures, or look up something on the Internet. Just not the smart phone price.",Good
"The device stucks at some points, and a battery doesn't hold as long as expected. Dependind on how I use it, i have to charge the phone twice in 24h. Besides those things, it does a lot of stuff that surprised me!",Good
"Phone was worse than expected with dents on back and damage to all corners. So far screen is flawless and phone stays charged, works well.",Good
"This is a great phone. I really like the way it feels, looks, and how intuitively easy it is to program as well as use. It's simple to make all kinds of major changes in the way it looks and operates. The only down side is the battery. It runs down very quickly. That said, I'm still thrilled with and will recommend it to others.",Good
"So far this product is fantastic! My wife is happy with the purchase and the setup was quite easy. My only challenge initially was how to get the back cover off the phone but I eventually figured it out. Haven't taken any photos as yet to test the ""super"" camera but I will update the post as soon as I do and see what quality I am getting.",Good
"I bought this to replace my other Lumia 822. For some reason Cortana doesn't work with my language and region (English, USA)!?! Yesterday the phone just froze up while I was making calendar entries. Remedy was to take the battery out and put it back in and restart the phone. Also an app dropped off because it said it wasn't supported by the SIM card I used (Verizon, USA). Confusing...but otherwise it is working. (Not sure if problems are the phone or the Windows 8.1 upgrade.)",Good
Although we had some issues the company was very quick to contact me and offfer many solutions. Sometimes you run into a bump especially with electronics however customer service is what keeps you coming back. This company offered many options to fix the problem which will have me try them again.,Good
"its not fancy and it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of brand name phones but for $20, you really cant complain. if you drop and it breaks, you dont have to cry like a baby like most iPhone users do, when they break their $600 phones because they refuse to protect it with a cellphone case.its a great emergency phone or for people dont know how to use a smartphone. its dual sim and great for international travel, where you can still keep your original sim in the phone and just add an additional sim when you travel. the battery is very big and the charge lasts almost a week of regular usethey claim the battery lasts almost a month on Stand by mode, which i am sure it does.i dont like it that i have to go through so many steps just to change volume settings.i dont like it that i am not able to add ringtones easily, the built in ringtones Suck.",Good
Very cool Kmoasfat color as well as the most excellent thank you to send the product in quick time as well as on packaging,Good
The phone is good for the price great camera great memory great speed the screen looks so cool nice feel the battery lasts me a day. fingerprint scanner works well I have it for metro pcs but there are some things about it you should know about the camera is kinda laggy with apps like Snapchat idk why but it's better if you just use the the pre installed camera app. The screen has trouble with 2 fingers at the same time. In my opinion the os sucks and for every app it always asks you for permission to use files or mic or camera or something of the sort. The emojis suck. Overall this phone is the best good price for what you are getting. I'm thinking of rooting to change the os and get back to the KitKat that I used to love.,Good
Every step of the process was perfect and easy. I received my BB the date they gave me and it works perfect,Good
The phone is in a good condition but it has some minor scratches. Note: it came without a Sim card,Good
Loved the phone. Nice feel and look. Very fast. But lags if on it for more than Two hours. More cases for it would be nice. Needs more Ebooks and games. Also if you try to DL something you will need another app like Adobe because if you don't you won't be able to see or read files. It will Always give an Error message. Can't not read File.,Good
"Pros:Excellent performance.SD card slot for expanding storage capacity.Gorilla Glass is scratch resistantSound is quite impressive not only loud but very clearPerfect size and weight.battery life is excellenti have lollipop 5.1Cons:No front facing camera.No flash on rear camera.Screen is bright, and crisp enough for the average person.you won't be able to take high resolution photo, but 5 megapixels is enough for small size printing and for most mobile phone screens.",Good
I must say that is an excellent device and even more for its price.Points in favor:its large battery and the charging time is very fast.the screen is very good.It has a very nice design nice touch and sight (not seen as a cheap phone)The device muve well between applications and tasks (not slow)The only unfavorable point: Are your cameras. While they are shown an acceptable quality. is not his strong main comparing it with similar cameras from other devices.,Good
Will definately protect your phone. Keep in mind it is big and bulky but quality is first rate.,Good
"I bought 2 of the Jitterbug phones to use with my T-Mobile account. When received they could not be used with my account. Actually would w, I really wanted these phones, one for myself and one for my husband. My brother has one and loves it. If at any time this phone could be used with T-Mobile I would buy it again.

"I have purchased refurbished phones before and you can tell whats been refurbish vs what is new. Other than not coming in an Iphone box and having a refurb sticker on the phone, I could not find any issues with it. Only complaint is with the cheap lightning cable and wall charger it came with its just silly when you can buy a nicer combo for just a few dollars more. Absolutely love the phone. Much better than the 6 and doesn't bend in your pocket like that pos.",Good
"keyboard is flimisly attached. Easy to break off, especially if dropped while extended.Here are the seven more words required.",Good
"I like it better than the Droid 2 I was using. Still locks up at times and makes me crazy. Have to remember this isn't a top-notch phone that multi-tasks easily. It's a little computer that can only do so much at a time. Learning to be patient!! Still, I am enjoying it.",Good

got this phone for my 85 year old mother. It was easy to set up and is easy for her to use. She likes it because the screen is bigger than her previous phone. Good phone for the price.,Good
"Solid phone. No LTE on ATT. One other random thing to consider. For some reason, the popular app iHeartRadio is not available specifically for this model. Otherwise, a great device!",Good
"I bought this item for some one else who asked for it, so I do not have detailed opinion on the product",Good
"fast shipping, reliable product so far. A bit disappointing that the packaging was so neutral and that the charger was not Apple branded.",Good
"Picked this up for mother in law who is intimidated by full featured smart phones.It does the job. Good form factor, works well as a basic phone.Ringtone is too quiet and menus are maddening. The fm radio is kind of pointless. She turned it on a few times and could not figure how to turn it off.Loaded it with a SIM from an off brand Carrier who uses ATT towers. Inexpensive, easy activation and goid coverage.",Good
I was looking for a simple opened smart telephone to be in contact now that I am moving to another country. It is working perfectly for that!,Good
"This is a great phone but it's not factory unlocked. Every time when I turn on a phone, it shows swisscom logo. Phone is unlocked and I can use any sim card, but it's not factory unlocked as it says. other than that phone is great, and it's very fast. Keep in mind that you'll have only 9gb free space, because of samsung aplicatons, so you may consider a additional micro sim card.",Good
"An amazing cellphone with minor problems. HTC One X is everything that you would expect from a high-end devide. Great looks, great processor speed and the lazy battery (I need to charge it every night).",Good
The watch is ok and works perfectly fine with T mobile sim card.Will buy one more for someone as a gift,Good
Good phone fair price. Worth it if you don't want to have a phone contract or monthly payment. Would order again.,Good

"This is my first smart phone. It was a great price and I'm really happy with it over all. I read a lot of reviews and heard that this was the best of low end phones and I'm sure that's true it's very responsive and does everything I need it to. The only problem I've had with it is that sometimes it won't turn on I have to plug it in and do a hard reset to turn it on, that's only happened a few times since I've had it.",Good

The case does what I need it to do. There were not a lot of options for cases for the Samsung 5 when I was looking. Not crazy about the color. But it protects it like I need it to. Easy to work the buttons.,Good
Phon is great. The large screen makes it great for reading or watching content. Battery life is not great at all.,Good
"I don't think I received a new one, earbuds seemed used. But it looks new and works well. It works in South East Asia, too. Fingerprint scanner does not work as well as my iPhone, but it's minor inconvenience. For complete S6 reviews, should go to real tech review sites like cnet.",Good
Great phone and as stated unlocked! Delivery was as stated. We can't wait to put it into service and see how it works.,Good
"WAS PLEASED WITH THE FAST SERVICE, GOT THE PHONE EARLIER THAN PROMISED. THE PHONE WORKS GREAT VERY HAPPY WITH IT.",Good
"The battery life is great. The screen is sharp, and gets brighter than you'll ever need. Every game I've played runs flawlessly. Getting it rooted was easy. The camera is adequate, it doesn't always focus the way you want it to. No complaints with signal or audio quality. There is one issue people should be aware of wanting to use any KITKAT phone with Straight Talk. The APN setting called ""APN TYPE"" is greyed out, making it impossible to receive and send MMS. I have found a few posted solutions, but haven't had any luck with them.",Good
the phone is in great condition. all through it has cut off twice while in mid process of working in an app.that is why its getting a 4 star. overall i am very pleased with the purchase. an i would purchase another phone .,Good
It is a very nice phone works fine...but WIFI did not work at first so I restarted the phone and worked fine...I like it very much and the price is very nice too..,Good
"I just want to replace my basic cell phone, but I don't want to be hooked up to monthly plans, the most important things I needed are just voice and wi-fi functions. This phone has both so I bought it. Not so good: the camera is so-so, pictures are not so good and not very easy to use, and the battery life is not very impressive - I need to recharge every night. But given at $200 you probably can't ask for more.",Good
"Too large, sometimes gets glitchy, it also does not have group chat, but other than that no complaints. Great phone.",Good
"Good looking case, it even comes with a mirror inside, it hides the cards you are carrying, so it is safer.",Good
"This was a replacement for another phone, really works well so far and A LOT CHEAPER than the Samsung I just bought before!Memory and some app issues, but great phone for the price!",Good
4 stars for just the sound-speckers on the phone there great compared to the newer phones around. . Thats about it,Good
Does exactly what I needed it to do. Only drawback is the size of the keys versus the size of my fingers.,Good
"To bad it was Palm's ""hail Mary"", and it didn't go as well as they wanted it to. And now that Hewlett Packard has purchased Palm, and is all but ignoring this phone, it's quickly degrading to the point where it will be nearly useless before it actually wears out. Sad ... like I say, this ""was"" the best phone ever.Addendum: HP has now disabled Google Maps on this phone, and re-routes any requests for map information to ""Bing"". This also disables dozens and dozens of other apps that depended on the Google Maps API. Hewlett Packard has gone beyond simply ignoring this phone, and is now actively disrupting it's original functionality. There are class action law suits in the works, but nothing will ever come of them. HP has simply ruined the best phone ever.",Good
"This phone was beautiful, worked well. However it did not work with my carrier, simple mobile. And I was disappointed. However, the sellers were understanding and helped me a lot. They shipped fast, and when I had to return it they took it back and gave me my refund quickly. Great people :) thanks and God bless!",Good
"It's a good phone. I have it set up with a straight talk sim. It's pretty fast and gets the job done. I have a few games I play on it and there's not much lag. The only thing is BLU phones do come with some bloatware, so I had to remove that. After that I installed Nova launcher on it as the stock launcher sucks. It doesn't have an app tray or anything. But that was an easy fix by installing Nova launcher. Overall good phone, I purchased this case (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01DEYYD5G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) for it. With a little modification with a knife it fits well. I've dropped it a couple of times and it seems to be okay, but I think that's because of the case. There's some negative reviews on here about it breaking quickly, but I'm not hard on my phone, so its standing up pretty well. The call quality is good and the speakers in it are loud. Overall not a bad phone for the price. Just be gentle with it and get a case for it and you should have no trouble with this phone.",Good
"I was pleasantly surprised by this BLU product when I first opened the box. Coming from Moto X 1G, I wasn't expecting much from this budget phone but it beats my Moto X when it comes to speed, screen and responsiveness. Unfortunately I had to return it because it is too big for my hands. I need the size just big enough to be able to operate with one hand. But I am replacing it with a slightly smaller Life One X 2016.",Good
"For folks who want LTE option on both sims -- this is not the product. Unfortunately, it wasn't mentioned anywhere clearly that only one SIM at a time can have LTE and the other will automatically switch to GSM (2G). I would have given it 3.5 starts, but no option for that. Software wise, one has to fish for things which more intuitive in the older models like S4Mini Dual Sim. I guess I just have to get used it. Battery life is poor though, if LTE is enabled, only way to get around it is enable the power saving mode.",Good
A little hard to get used to after having an iPhone but mostly it's good. I think it's a little big but it works fine.,Good
"After looking at smart phones, and noting that the user manuals were typically 500 pp. (not, alas, an exaggeration), I realized that a phone of middling intelligence would suit me just fine. The price here was 50% - 60% less than on other sites. It arrived promptly, and does all that I ask it to do: call, text, and function as my alarm clock. It does have Internet connectivity, but it's so slow, it's like time-travel back to the 1990s. I knew that going in, however. If you need to be able to update your twitter and/or Facebook frequently from your phone, keep on looking. If you just want a, you know, a *phone*, this is smart enough.",Good
"Is original otter box case, sipped on time when I get the free trial on prime shipping and excellent for the price.",Good
"It worked, and for what I paid for it, I'm satisfied. I haven't had a problem in the few months I've had it.",Good
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",Good
"If you've ever found yourself ""in between"" phones due to theft or other unpredicatble happenings this quick and easy device you keep in a drawer for just those moments. The price on them makes it a Perfect plan B phone for just those times.",Good
"It came as described, ATT branded, unlocked and worked like a charm in Mexican networks got 4G with TELCEL and Iusacell, giving 4 stars because it arrived delayed.",Good
muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a,Good
"Like the phone a lot. Decent battery, fast enough, good stock Android. Can't beat the price for what you get.",Good
It is what it is. Discolored spots throughout the back but I expected there to be some sort of downside due to the used description,Good
"All things considered - if you want an affordable smartphone, this is the one. The hardware looks great, the Symbian graphical interface is a bit old looking - but that can be mended with easily downloadable skins.You are not going to get endless cool add on apps like with the i-phone - however, if you are looking for a QWERTY keyboard, non-touch screen interface (keywords again being: affordable, all rounder) - buy this. No regrets.",Good
"Easey to use. Beautiful screen resolution, beautiful pictures. Fast. Purchased to replace my galaxy note 3 that I accidentally destroyed...this is my second favorite phone. My only complaint is the ear speaker is kind of quiet...",Good
"Phone is unlocked. The only problem is that it has only one language: English. Therefore, although the phone is good user does not read English.",Good
Very nice phone especially for the money. The only reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is the inability to pull the battery to reboot the phone. Although this males the phone safer it also makes it difficult to deal with if the phone freezes.,Good
"Pros: Good looking phone and high quality in every aspect. I was using Nokia N97 Mini and it was too small when I surfed the web then Amazon has this E7 on sale for $359, I took my chance and bought it right away. There are some kind of inventory shortage of Nokia E7 on Amazon since the price jumped up to $430 couple weeks ago. The Nokia E7 has similar functions as my N97 Mini except bigger screen. I like it very much.Cons: Battery seems running out more than my N97 mini, I have to charge it every night. Sometime it is frozen for a while when I have several applications opened at once. Other than that, it is a great looking phone and everybody keeps asking what kind of phone do I have. Can't wait until Nokia releases Belle.",Good
I wasn't able to use the phone due to fact I opted to stay with my current cell-phone..carrier.. .At&t would not transfer my old number.or the minutes... all a matter of staying with my current carrier..,Good
"Nice phone but unlike the white phone from a different supplier, this one did not include the simple USA power converter for the European charger.",Good
"This is the only fone which is X but there is nothing X in this fone. I mean to say everything is RIGHT, nothing WRONG.",Good
I love my S-7! I went from a Galaxy S-3 to the S-7 and it was quite the leap. I have had the phone for about 3 months now and just dropped it so beware! It was less than a foot off the ground when it fell and it trashed the screen. Now I have to figure out how to get it fixed. However the phone was delivered promptly. I have not had any problems with the phone besides the cracked screen which was my error and not the sellers.,Good
"Nice phone, works good. I like the skin they put on Android, for the most part. Plastic back not so great compared to other models, speaker not that loud, call quality on the ear speaker just average so far. Hard to beat though when it comes to the processor on this phone! It's got a very fast processor!",Good
"The phone works good. Super fast and I love the large amount of memory that I have. It took awhile for AT&T to get the Sun Card to work at first it didn't work. My LTE doesn't work, I live in Dallas Texas Area so that is upsetting why I'm going to give it 4 stars. Turns out I had to go to a different AT&T Store and they programmed APA to get the LTE and MMS to work. I believe it's 3G but I'm cool with that. 4 stars just after a week worth of use it will not recognize the audio jack when I put in headphones. I have to restart the phone than it will work sadly.",Good
"In perfect condition and new. Thanks! Only issue I didn't realize prior to buying this was that it requires a microSIM card instead of a regular SIM, so you need to make sure you have a microSIM before expecting to be able to use your Lumia 920.",Good
"I received the phone but the microphone did not work. Upon sending it back, a replacement was sent. The new one works fine. This is a really nice phone.",Good
"I just moved to this phone from the M7 version. I never used the M8. It is a little different than the M7, but I can't tell if performance is better yet... the M7 is a damn good phone. I appreciate the ability to add an SD card. I only put in a 32GB card, but I plan to put in the newest, fastest, 128GB card after I get the phone personalized/set up the way I like it.I will leave my review like this unless I run into problems or poor performance. I'll update if there's anything to report.",Good
The cell is simply extraordinary worth buying..... GOGO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO TO BUY NOW,Good
Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great.,Good
"1st off, this thing is huge!!, same size & features as the note 2....a little complicated, take some time to familarize yourself with this phone...screen is beautiful & clear...didn't come with screen protectors or case...headphones suck!!!, it doesn't take regular headphones..it took forever to be shipped, you r going to wait about a month!!!, if you r looking for cases, just type in star i9220 phone cases or just go to any store & show them the phone, same thing for headphones too...didn't come with a stylus either!!!...charger is very cheap!!!, mines broke in 3 days!!!!, quick responsive touch screen...front camera is terrible compared to back camera (very clear)...minor issues but still a great phone!!, it IS the note 2!!!, worth the $ & wait!!",Good
Purchased for significant other when he lost his phone. He is very happy with it.,Good
The main thing wrong with it is that it has the old style power connection which means it has to have a separate cord for it.,Good
The phone is fine - I'm just bummed that I lost my other phone and had to pay $280 to replace it - but that was 'my bad'.,Good
"very good cellphone when you compare with more expensives devices... Very fast in the web, high quality in video playing.",Good
"I love the phone but after a week having the Xperia Z5 I'm experiencing an issue with the touch screen. When I go to unlock the phone, the emergency call screen will pop up then once I have the phone unlocked, the phone will open up multiple icons by itself. the touch screen is going haywire, I turned my phone on and off countless of times and it still opens up random apps without me touching the screen.",Good
"the phone is really worth the price you can not beat it, it comes with to many apps that eat up the 16 gigs internal memory , but some can be deleted without any harm to the phone, Camaro works well , sounds great even thought its not stero , but with head phones nice rich sound. fits great when holding it for smaller hands you should use two hands. have downloaded four movies and they play very well. the Battery doesn't last has long as they say, but still will give you good amount of playing time if your on the net or gaming. all in all for the price and what the Blu Studio 7.0 LTE is one of the best deal on the market",Good
"I totally loved the phone, but unfortunately it was locked, but. I was looking for an unlocked phone. i am very disappointed by this situation.",Good
"Basically, i am in love with this BLU phone at 80 percent. I said 80 percentbecause sometimes the phone is having problem of ""write up disk"" most of the time.I am still having the same issue i guess. Also, you will often have to shutdown and restart yourcell phone cause you will see some unusual problem happening to this BLU phone.At least, we can do basic things like calling, texting, videos, pictures, etc.Generally, it is not a bad phone if you are not too mad at using it.For the case, i would try to say the seller is recommended.",Good
This is a great value and the battery goes on and on as compared to other smartphones I have used. The large size works well for me and will fit in my pocket.,Good
I own one already and it's just right for me. this one is for my 15 yr old for Christmas.,Good
"Good case..fits the new IPhone SE well. Only small issue is the screen cover seems to collect a bit of dust. Overall, I'd buy it again.",Good
"This phone was a replacement phone for the first one that got when it first came out and have always loved it .... because it is a Smart phone with 4G functions and capabilities and because of the slide-out QWERTY keyboard. When my first phone got damaged, I was devastated because the newer models don't come with slide keyboards, anymore, and this model was not available from my phone provider any longer. The only way I could get it is thru Amazon ... which was a blessing. And, I continue to love it because it meets all my needs perfectly.",Good
"Best budget phone ever. Has great display that pops, great signal and speed once I got 57 Mbps per second on T-Mobile but that also depends on coverage and where you live. I love it features sometimes I feel like I'm using a Nexus. No Andriod 5.1.1 yet but who cares you're getting a lot for your money! Sometimes I forget this is not a flagship. The camera is OK but honestly I think a software update will fix it since it's the same sensor in the one plus one. So if you have $250 get this phone!!!!!",Good
Nice looking phone had mine for over a month been having some issues it's been getting really hot and shutting down by it self. Talk to blu customer service they were really good and are helping me resolved the problem.,Good
Very nice looking. I've since dropped my phone on the concrete and it's still ticking.,Good
So far this phone is working well. It seems to be a step down from the Samsung Epic in some functionality especially sorting the apps that I have downloaded in alphabetical order but it does the job. Good Phone,Good
"I love the phone, It was a great buy. It came really fast in the mail, way sooner than expected. There was only one problem with the purchase of my items. The problem was that the charger that came with the phone easily came unravled at the end of it. It still works but its barely hanging on and i doubt it will last much longer.",Good
"So far so good! Very impressed with the phone's quality of calls and data functions. Got service with Net10 and 4G coverage is good. Battery life has been a surprise too! I got the phone to test Net10 GSM service in my area because I'm thinking of ending service with Verizon. Also, speakers sound great in comparison with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. I would recommend!",Good
thank you! battery goes down fast right? everything else is fine and good but i really want to know if battery is iike tham,Good
"This product did exactly what it was supposed to do, protect my phone when it fell on a number of occasions. I began using the belt clip to carry my phone which I was not accustomed to, and a few times I did not snap it on as well as I should, causing it to fall. The phone is still working fine, thanks to this case.",Good
I got this phone because I want a simple phone for voice only and a long battery life. That is what I got. Battery life is excellent so far. Last over a week with reasonable voice usage. Hopefully the longevity of the battery charge will last a while. The rest of the features are crappy if compared to modern smart phone features of course.,Good
"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because from time to time it freezes up while on facebook or texting, and it turned off while in the middle of a phone call. Otherwise I like the phone.",Good
So I got this phone on time . came with a case and a screen protector but the case doesn't fit on it very well. Runs decent but this is not a top dollar phone but for any average person it will work great battery life is OK screen looks good,Good
"This cell phone is very easy to navigate thru & set up. Also, it charges quickly. I brought two - 1 as a gift and the other for myself.",Good
"This is my very first smart phone and I love it. Everyday I am learning something new with it. I dont know much about technology but from the basics that I do know this phone is a great product. It came faster than the time it was given. The one thing that I do not like about it is that I wanted to buy beats headphones for it and before i was going to buy them I tested them to see if they fit. The way the whole is made unfortunately it DOES NOT FIT or any other type of headphones in that matter. I do believe that only basic small headphones for it will work, but other than that I have no complaints about the phone.",Good
"Bought this phone for my wife replacing a cheap smartphone.IT IS BIG!!!I can't stress how big this phone actually is, but you can compare it to an amazon fire 7"" tablet.It won't fit well in pockets and it has very few cases that will actually fit itThe screen resolution is not badThe sound isn't the greatest but you can hear well on itThe phone ran fast when she first started to use it but greatly slowed once she loaded her apps on it.She had issue with the phone restarting itself after about a 2 months of use.Just last week her phone slid off the couch onto a hardwood floor and busted not only the screen but the digitizer as well, so I would say that a 2 foot drop is too much for this phone.",Good
"The phone itself it's great, works well, but it still has the kitkat version of android, there hasnt been any new updates for the software officially, even though many companies have lollipop ages ago",Good
"Works great.... Since I have had it, I have been able to enjoy talking, testing and music. I would recommend this product..",Good
The device is really impressive for the price. The only thing I would point out is the charging takes too long (around 3 hours to be fully charged).,Good
"The phone shipped in 3 days which was great and it came in a AT&T box w new packaging but its black not carbon blue like it says but I don't care. The only problem I have is the battery life sucks really bad, I've had a Note 2 before and I don't recall the battery life draining so fast but I can handle it, no biggie. And my other issue is the screen and outter part of cell where the headphones go bulges up and out a little. So this makes me wonder if it was a new cell likenit states. So that's really the only reason i gave only 4 stars not 5. I had a iphone 5c before but oy for a few months. I had to go back to an Android phone they are much simplerI missed my big screen like i had on my old galaxy note 2",Good
"Seems pretty solid, runs older OS, however I cannot use it in the US, even if I manually enter APN information. Could be flashed, if you find similar phone OS to use...",Good
"A monster of a phone for the price, if you don't want to move onto the z3 or the smaller z3 compact, this is a great choice",Good
"I bought this for my mom who has never owned a smart phone until now. The initial set up was easy. The phone functions were straightforward, so teaching her to use the phone was easy too. She loved the color of the phone. I picked the blue one, which turned out to be this bright, pearly blue. Very nice. Not giving this 5 stars yet because we just got this phone and don't know if any problems will arise.",Good
nice phone but everytime turned on it says back cover is not snapped on but it is.,Good
"I sent it back. There were some issues with it that I didn't want to deal with. So, I sent it back and went with a different carrier.",Good
I love this phone....just 1 issue I have the operating system does not allow me to see who is calling me even though they are in my contact list,Good
"The 6 plus and even the 6 are way too big, so I scrambled to get a 5s (refurbished) while I still could. (Of course, now they've introduced the SE, which might be better for you). It works with the latest iOS just peachy. Love it. I think ultimately Apple products are mostly over-priced, but the user experience is significantly better than competing products.Took me a long while to actually get on board with smart phones, this was an excellent entry into that world.",Good
It is very good. and easy to use. Contains apalicaciones good and excellent space for storage. Ofrece una buena experiencia.,Good
"I really like this phone. However, it is very delicate. I dropped it about 10 inches from the ground and it completely shattered 3 days after I received it. there goes 75.00 right down the drain. oh well. still like it",Good
Good reliable phone. Works as advertised. Nice to find a reliable phone that is not required to have a data plan.,Good
This item works as described but I have become accustomed to a more advanced user interface for a cell phone.,Good
The description of this phone is very misleading and this is why it previously got one star from me.If however you're on AT&T then awesome! Works like a charm so far with very fast loading internet.Screen brightness is a bit blah - but not a crisis for me; Expected better picture quality but alas and you gotta charge it every day even for me who is not a heavy user.Overall great value for money,Good
"The unit was a gift to my grandson. As of yesterday, it was working fine. There is a limitation in programming because Vzw will not provide all the perks as a used phone and not from their source. I would suggest that the purchase of a used iphone has such limitations, and not through the fault of a seller. This buy was a bargain, but I suspect Vzw and others wish to control how adaptable to changie like new assets of their phones should be, especially in older ones. Any way, a teenager gets some peer approval as well as features not on a flip model!",Good
simple to use but phone carrier keeps sending unwanted text messages. Don't want any texts. Good for elderly mom for speed dials n long battery life,Good
"This is a good bang-for-the-buck phone. It has front camera, flash, 4G LTE etc. It is fairly water tolerant (used it while it was raining). It is light too. The battery lasts for a day easily with just phone calls and browsing. I only charge once in 2 days.One thing that I loved in it compared to Android phones is - it has terrific ringtones for alarms, phone calls and messages (that's more a comment on Windows 8 rather than the phone itself). The tile UI for organizing apps is also very nice.Windows does not have the same level of App coverage as iOS or Android. So, that is a pain. For example, Uber App on the phone barely works. Lyft does not even start. There is no support for GMail, voice navigation for maps, Google Voice.",Good
This is the second one I ordered. The first one the numbers1 2 3 stopped working. So far this one is doing o.k.,Good
"I'm happy with everything except the camera. Eventhough it's 8 MP, the quality of the photos is very disappointing. It doesn't seem to have auto-focus like the other camera phones I've had in the past.",Good
"Good replacement for my Nokia 2700, which stopped working. Almost the same phone, therefore easy to use immediately. The only flaw is a very poor display of signal strength, charge level, time of day--all very tiny and bunched at the top of the screen, and no setting that allows changing the visual format.",Good
The item was returned because I purchased it for a gift and had already been replaced. I just no longer needed it.,Good
Have it for a few days. Make and receive call good still trying to figure out the other features. Manual is difficult to undestand,Good
"Reliable tough phone. Bought another for my wife, and she is happy with it too.",Good
"When it arrived it was as describe minor scratches but that was expected and nothing that makes the phone look bad. The only reason it got 4 stars and not 5 was because the 1st 3 days after it arrived it was not working, called verizon, they reset everything I restarted the phone and it's been working for 2 weeks with no issues.",Good
Delivered ahead of schedule and in mint condition. Only issue was some charge cables did not seat properly and intermittently charged. We have been able to correct so it's working great!,Good
Bought this phone for a teenager. Not a big fan of Apple products. This is a great phone for the price. Very pleased with this purchase.,Good
"Is a nice phone, the display is too small, hard to use, i buy the Samsung captivity for the same price and is better than this",Good
"I purchased the Nokia Lumia 800 this summer and it quickly becomes one of my favorite phone. The screen is very responsive and the phone is fast. Camera quality is acceptable and the weight of the phone is just right. Battery life is about a day and a half. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the operating system situation. The current OS on my Lumia is WP 7.5 and it can only be upgraded to 7.8 in the future, not the latest WP8. It's still a quality phone given the price.",Good
"CONS:buttons are a little too narrow. txting is sometimes a little counterintuitive. if you buy the international version, then it's difficult to get the network up and running. I still haven't gotten mine up and I've followed through with customer service's directions.PROS:Nice candy bar shape. Sleek. Good quality camera pics. No lag in the operating system (compared to SLVR). Makes/takes calls. Good amount of features.",Good
"Pro:- Good price- 4G RAM, 64G storage- Finger print reader is accurate and quick- Turbo charge (Quick Charge 2.0)Con:- No indicator LED- No NFC (Android Pay, etc)- Just a bit too vanilla with software featuresOverall:- Excellent buy for the price. There is no rationality for me to justify buying $700 phone anymore.",Good
"I really like this phone. The dual slider keyboards are a big plus to me. And the fact it is not a ""smart"" phone. The only things I had a problem was the manual which was too cursory in their coverage of the phone's options. I had to go to my Ford dealer to find out how to get the contacts downloaded to my MS SYNC. It turns out the have to be ""pushed"" one at a time to the SYNC system. However there is no place in the manual it explains how to do it. Now that I know how, all is fine. It was tedious and time consuming, but it worked. I'm glad I don't have a ton of contacts I call.Other things not covered in the manual are how to add optional ringtones from you computer. Turns out they can't be bigger than 300KB. This is not documented. I also want to switch from the SIM phone book to the Phone phone book as it allows more options, but so far I can figure out that option. A more complete manual sure would be better. Thank goodness for the AT&T community blog. It sure has been useful.",Good
"Have been using this device for over a year now, and would recommend to anyone looking for a good value-for-money smart phone.Build quality and look & feel is pretty decent, and so is performance. However, that is not to say that it's without the occasional lag!!Battery lasts for about a day max, with always on HSPA together with background data sync. Web browsing and email used quite frequently throughout the day, together with Games and other apps like FB and Google+.Good display. Sound are not that impressive though, neither with the built-in speaker nor with headphones plugged in. Camera is decent, but not great. Heats up quite a bit when used extensively and gets uncomfortable.",Good
The phone came in a reasonable time and works great so far. The only negative issue is thst the screen has a liquid spot apparently from heating the screen when separating it from the digitizer. This is the reason for the four stars. The camera lens also has spots on it which are quite visible. I haven't tried to print a photo taken with the camera so i'm not aware of any distortion of any of the photos taken.,Good
I bought this phone because I ran my old one through the washer. Really nice phone but not waterproof so I can not give it 5 stars.,Good
Great phone. But when calling you can't get the screen to come on. The light sensor needs a flashlight up to it just to come on,Good
"lo recomiendo, lo Ì¼nico es que si se adquiere para Movistar no levanta 3G y no trae tarjeta de memoria!!!",Good
"I got the phone in the mail brand new in perfect condition. Phone works great. I do recommend this phone especially for the price, but I do like the Samsung Galaxy S III better.",Good
"Love the phone. Has worked almost flawlessly since purchased. The only problem I have had is in using the earphone jack. My suggestion is if you can use Bluetooth use that instead of the earphone jack. There is a design flaw that I discovered sometimes does not let the ear phone jack contact release so your phone stays on headphone even though there is nothing plugged into the jack.I use a Qi charger and it charges extremely well even with a case on it. I would purchase another one, except it is not upgradeable to Windows 10.",Good
"This is the second OtterBox that I've owned. Only problem encountered is the plastic snap connections on the inner case. The are so thin and tiny that if you have to open the case several times, then tend to break.",Good
"So far no complaints, well maybe a little one: the phone has a problem reading a 2gb microsd that i had already, when i try to open a photo stored in the sd, the phone freeze. i don't know if its a problem of the microsd or phone. but i just removed the card and problem solve. the phone is also very fluid and has very good battery, it last 2 days of regular use of wifi, calls, whatsapp and web browsing.",Good
"great phone and awesome qualitythe bad thing for me was the battery, it drains like crazy, and the charger that it needs is different from the usual ones",Good
The CHARGER PORT on the phone was DEFECTIVE: I couldn't PLUG the CHARGER into it so I sent it back. It was a nice phone otherwise.,Good
"This is a knockoff made by downgrading certain parts of the phone, mainly the camera, the memory and the chip.I think some of the reviews on here are based on people wanted the real thing for a bargain price.The camera is only 2mp which in my opinion is the biggest downside of buying this phone.But considering I am saving several hundred dollars over the actual Note, I can live with that.Mine came with an extra back, screen protector, two batteries, charger, headphones and stylus. The phone looks great and so far has had no issues. For the price I am very pleased with the phone.I have shown it to several people and they are all amazed that it isn't an actual Samsung Note.This is a great phone for this price.",Good
Brought this phone in Aug 2016. Gas been working great so far. Only thing it came without headphones.,Good
"I had seen some reviews that said the phone was counterfeit. But I called Samsung and gave them the serial number and they confirmed it was genuine. The adapter of the charger did not work and the headset had shorts. I contacted the seller and they sent me a new charger and headset. They both work fine now. I have no problems with the phone ,",Good
good phone but turns off suddenly for no reason once in awhile. good for a non smart phone though and has a decent camera and good keyboard for texting,Good
"The phone is great appreciate perfect. The operating system has some obvious flaws and the n900 is in need of some polishing. for example there is no built in a develop he front facing camera and the OS is jerky. Hardware on the phone is great, bette develop ost. I especially apreciate the fm chip and the high resolution screen. When buying this phone keep in mind that it is not for tech beginners. This is not a gaming phone, this is not a phone phone, this is not even as some claim an internet tablet. This phone really is for people looking to develope their own apps and use advanced pc like features. Make sure you know what you are getting before buying this phone.",Good
"Not a fault of Amazon but please note this is an AT&T branded 877 model that is unlocked, not the true unbranded international version. The title just needs to be updated to reflect this to avoid confusion.Also pretty cool that Amazon sold a new device rather than refurbished, which is very much appreciated.",Good
Great picture. Took a few visits to T-Mobile to figure out the functions. No instruction manual or tips to help. On-line did not produce the results. Finally figured out how to turn this off using certain finger pressure to the side of the button. Everything else works very well with great picture and lots of memory to cover all my needs. Nice size. Bought a HD case to protect this as I have dropped a few phones over the years. Quality phone & my second LG phone the first being a flip phone many years ago that still works fine.,Good
completely satisfied with this product orders arrived the day stipulated ... agree with the request if this provider would advisebut does not work with 3g,Good
WAS VERY HAPPY WIYH MY BLU DASH SMARTPHONE BUT WAS NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT THE FINISH OF THE GOLD.,Good
"I bought this case to have an extra, the only bad thing about it is the screen protector wasn't sealed at the top. Everything else was great.",Good
"I love this phone, its a good size , Great camera . Just a little slow but I also dont like that the phone contains little memory so if you like to store memory in your phone you may need to purchase a memory card.",Good
Good phone this one is meant for my girlfriend and she's been wanting a sturdy phone but I wanted to get her a smartphone for the hell of it so why not and its great for the first timers just don't expect this thing to be secreting performance with 1 gig of ram.,Good
"Well packed and on time delivery. The reason for four stars is that I US plug converted I received didn't fit properly. Except that, no complaints about the product.",Good
"Phone is great, but it only charged the first time. I tried charging it again for the second time and it did not reacting at all. I used the same usb cable with the adapter from my kindle charger and it worked fine. I love the camera and the battery lasts for days!",Good
"So far so good but my wife's phone has trouble with pictures and videos. Also when I Sbeam pics from one phone to the other, the pics are saved in download rather than on the SD card...any way to fix that?",Good
Nice features for the price. Camera front and rear just average. Very low volume for telephone especially in hands free sucks.,Good
The phone came with some scratches in the back that weren't mentioned in the description. Also came with some photos and one of a naked man. Totally inappropiate. The delivery in perfect time.,Good
The phone works great. We were surprised by no wall connector but was easily fixed at wall mart.,Good
. Good for the price. No video but has camera is fine and works well for my needs.if you want a phone but not a lot of bells and whistles it is great!,Good
There was a mishap with the phone and the company greatly apologized for that. I received an extra battery and charger for the inconvenience. They were great at communication and responded to my email promptly.,Good
I got mine one year ago and it still work properly. I've made a good choice when I bought that phone.,Good
"Very good phone, but has shortcomings, not with the phone so much but with the Android operating system.",Good
"its okay, the phone did not come unlocked, but I managed to unlock the operator page",Good
"I like the phone. It just freezes up at times, and sometimes my notification bar keeps blinking. Other than that, phone is great. No problems so far.",Good
"Great phone has all basic necessities. On off button gets stuck a little or but doesn't happen often. Graphics are great, end of the day it's a great phone for the price.",Good
It is good price for something not easy to find.If you go to Nextel and buy a new one.They charge you with a two year contract for $99.00 plus taxes monthly...it will be more than $2400.00 andmore if you have to buy the blackberry for $129.00Only thing is it come without box only the blackberry and it charger... but anywayWill you use the carton box for talking and testing?You could compare...,Good
It's neat charging on a disc and I like the light color change to let you know where the charging is in the process and when it's complete. Seems like it takes longer then just plugging it in.,Good
The flash light accidentally comes on in my wife's purse. Other than that very good. Battery life is very good.,Good
"I think that the price-quality is good, but i have a doubt. I want to know if the phone has a LED light because i see two little circles next to the front camera, so i guess that one is a sensor and the other must be the LED Light, But im not sure.",Good
"happy with phone, but ear buds included are NOT good. Folks on the other end of the line say they can't understand me....sounds like I 'm underwater. Don't want to return the phone, but sure would like a better pair of earbuds. If I had it to do over again, think I'd go with iPhone 5. Bigger screen would be nice. This is my first iPhone.",Good
"Great phone for the price very fluent and smooth, camera is amazingly great, after a few months mine started to malfunction, the digitilizer had to be change. but other than that it works great and the voice control camera shooter works fine...arrive on time and well package.",Good
After just updating apps the 4gb is practically exhausted. Otherwise it's a nice handset so far,Good
I am very pleased with this phone. I purchased it to replace my tmobile G1 because I no longer need a data plan. For me it's very easy to use and has excellent battery life. I would recommend this phone to anyone who doensn't need all the bells and whistles.,Good
For me its good everyway as far as technical use but its too heavy to handle i love the screen the size good,Good
Phone has some outstanding features. The camera is exceptional. As is the screen. For the money it is a really good buy.,Good
"I was skeptical of buying this item because of a bad review, but this company and the item has exceeded my expectations. The company was quick to process the order and the product was at my house within 3 days (standard shipping). From the description it sounded as if this would be a hard plastic case (which I wanted) and from one review, it sounded like it would be silicone (which I did not want), but I was pleased when it arrived and it was hard rubber - a happy medium. The ""white"" of the case is kind of see through, but it really looks nice. After a week a small piece of the design flaked off by the seam, but it is hardly noticeable. With some abuse, I can see this design not exceeding a life span over a year, but the case will always be fine. I received a few unsolicited compliments about how pretty the phone case was already and for the price, I am thinking of buying a couple more from the company to change out with my mood.",Good
"Be warned guys, this phone is not ""new"" as advertised, first thing I did was entering ##634# and saw the lifetime counter at 1:21:04 meaning that the phone I received was already used by someone else. I also noticed a small scuff on the upper left corner of the phone, not a big deal though a case will hide that. So think twice before buying a ""new"" phone when you know its not supposed to. I am unfortunately stuck with it as I don't live in the US. But for the rest everything works, even my carriers data (no LTE, H+ works flawlessly)",Good
This came on time and is a great deal for an Android. Can't beat it . It is loaded with features.,Good
I like this phone. Not too much to handle but I'm working I'm still playing around with it. So far so good,Good
"The features are OK, but it's not a great value. Not a huge step up from the Galaxy 6. If you have a Galaxy 6 edge and are looking to upgrade, hold off on this one. It's not groundbreaking stuff. More of the same.",Good
Love ‰_ the phone _ÙÒ± but was not 5.9 its a 5.5 but the camera _ÙÒá is great,Good
I don't know what is wrong with it .It just get chargeless very quick and don't want to get charge easily either. Let me know if u have any idea to make it work better. Thankyou.,Good
"good morning, the phone works well on my part, all you have is that sometimes I make calls sometimes the receiving does not hear me and I hang up the call to take another listen to me then, it will be because unlike the other android phones do not install the USB driver on windows, in my case I have seven at home and XP at work then I find compactibility to transfer files. but everything else excellent I came in good time, the mobile has filled my expectation, ahh another thing does not work at maximum speed 4G supporting HSPA + is to modify title.",Good
Phone had a couple of scratches in the back & at the bottom around the charging port. Aside from that the phone has been functioning perfectly & I am satisfied for the time being.,Good
"It was a very nice purchase. Quick delivery and excellent service. Brand new product and warranty. Everything included: chargers, cables and even headphones. 100% Customer Satisfaction.",Good

Disappointed that Blackphone does not use third party apps so therefore I can't use any social media apps on this phone. Overall the privacy settings are great and that's the main focus for using the phone.,Good
"A lot of phone for the price. Works well, has about every feature you want including dual SIM - which is really nice. Only complaint is that there isn't any LTE support, only the slower 4G HSPA+, but when you consider the price it's a great deal",Good
The cellphone was for my mom & she loved it. It's a pretty good phone for the price.,Good
"It's very cool looking,slim, 2 cameras (front and back). But I do not recommend you buy this b/c it's running as slow as you want to break it...",Good
Best phone in the market. The only downside is that after 6 months (heavily) use the microphone broke and doesn't work properly. But I have it without a case or a screen guard and it looks brand new,Good
"A good dependable smart phone. I would have given it five stars, but I find the battery wears down so fast. I don't know howthat compares to other model.s",Good
"I ordered this phone for my son. It arrived on time, but the charger is not working. So i decided to let him use my charger instead. Other than that, its ok.",Good
It is exactly what I was expecting. The only thing is that the seller included in the package the wrong charger port. It was not compatible with the cell that I got. I call that human error. Since I don't live in the US I could not return the package or asked for a new one. I just purchased another charger. But the cell was what I was expecting...,Good
Everything works great Updating took really long but it's on older phone still runs pretty fast processor wise,Good
Exceeded my expectations. Just needed a little time to get used to the sensitive edges. The only downfall is there is no memory card slot,Good
"Amazing phablet, the samsung galaxy note 3 N9005 also come in 16 Gb version, but it's a international version, be carefull with the sellers because i ordered two tablets, to different sellers, and one of those came opened! However the samsung galaxy note 3 N9005 is an unbelievable machine!",Good
"The phone is great. Top of the line for online use and just about everything you can imagine with a smartphone. Really love the front and back camera. the only thing that bothers me about the phone is its battery life. With everything you can do on it, you can easily drain your battery.",Good
"i love itis a very exceptional phone, easy to use, ligth weigth, powerfull sistem and excellent aplications i love it",Good
"I like Nokia phones a lot, mostly because they have a nice software and they are easy to use. I decided to get this phone because the reasonable price and the reviews I read before. Pros: easy to use software, nice applications, great style, size, weight, keyboard is great and easy to use (not like iphone ""keyboard"" that is annoying), reception is excellent (I am using 3g).What I don't like: camera, pictures have really bad quality, flash does not help and it's pretty much imposible to get a picture if it's dark. This phone has 2 major issues: sometimes software gets freezed and does not respond after 10 seconds most likely, after that it works fine. The other issue is that sometimes the phone does not displays anything but the main screen, no menu, no messages, anything, to get this solved I have to turn the phone off and turn it back on, I just checked and I have the latest firmware and software so I guess the may be working on this.",Good
Returned it because the speaker didn't work which the seller didn't realize and was apologetic about but other than that it was as described and in good working order,Good
"great phone meets expectations, speed, user adaptability, ease of use, good battery life, and with respect to others has no overheating problems.",Good
if you are looking for a super small Android phone that functions just like a standard size Android phone then this is definitely the phone for you it is super small and gets the job done with no problem at all.,Good
"The phone looked brand new, beautiful and shiny, no scratches whatsoever and I had no problem activating it even though I bought this phone expecting to have to buy a SIM card or something since it said it didn't come with one. I didn't even have to leave my room to activate it, looked just like my old phone with all my apps (minus like 2 or 3) all within about 30 minutes, I even still had all of my text messages.",Good
I wish i could customize it a but more-front screen and all that- but its a flip phone and i like it. Battery isnt the best. Especially for a basic phone. I activated it on verizon prepaid plan no trouble at all with the DEC instead of an imei. I thing it was like quality used phones? I do love it so far,Good
"very good phone. when i splashed hot oil(don't ask) on it, for the next 2 months i would test as i was wiping oil out of the seams as it is still leaking little dots of oil. tough phone",Good
This is a great phone. The only problem I'm having is that sometimes it turns off on its own and I have to reset it by taking the battery out and putting it back in. Otherwise I love it and the price is right.,Good
I always wanted a Samsung galaxy mega and finally bought one. Its used but was worth the price. The only con on this phone....it freezes sometimes. Again its used but I love it.,Good
I am enjoying my new phone. I still have a lot to learn about it. Just bought a new cover for it.,Good
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",Good
very good working condition the best iden on market now I have access to social media and e-mail and walke-talkeåÊMotorola i1 (Boost Mobile),Good
Phone was like new.It was unlocked just like stated in the details and was shipped in the perfect amount of time!!,Good
The phone is a gift. They arrange that I pay the bill and the user never sees the bill.They worked with me and the the new user is finding the phone very easy to use.,Good
Fantastic Windows Phone. Nokia build quality is superb. The phone is thin & light but has a good solid feel in the hand. A case is mandatory!!! This phone is very slick and will jump out of your hand like a slippery fish. I updated the OS version to 8.1. This update propels the device far ahead of Androids & iOS. The phone is super fast& responsive. The only thing missing are Google Apps. When Google releases apps for WP this device will be perfect!!,Good
"Came as expected. We were looking for a cheap replacement phone for our daughter until we switch her to a smart phone. It was like brand new, and did exactly what it said it would do. Also, on the 2nd day, my son dropped it into a cup of pop, and we cleaned it right away, and it is still working like normal!",Good
"Its a really good smart-phone.The life battery is the same that all the others smart-phones.I bought this cell-phone in USA to use it in CHILE and everything is fine. The only thing that I can say is that ENTEL (my cell phone company) has restrictions when you want to share Internet. You have to have a ""Multimedia Plan"".....they said.A stupid thing to me....The signal is good and all my calls has been good quality. But sometimes at the subway I lost completely the coverage. I didn't try make a call in that moment, but the Internet connection is lost.The device is really flat and with a excellent weigh. Really clear screen and you can control your life battery using 2G Internet service, brightness screen.To me is a good choice.",Good
After reading other reviews I decided to take the leap and purchase a BLU phone. I don't regret it yet (only had it a few days). The one downside so far that is ridiculous is the short battery life! So the 4 stars are solely due to the battery life being sucky! I'll update my review in a month or so on the overall phone features and such.,Good
I like it so far. The stylus pen tip is little too hard to click. I would have liked it if the tip was softer. Yes I would recommend it to anyone.,Good
The item did not seem to be brand new. There was no manual or head set.,Good
I bought this phone for our 12 year old daughter and this is a perfect phone for a first time user. Easy to set up and maneuver through it's smartphone like in many ways. The only complaint I have is that if you're not careful it is very easy to wake the phone and accidently dial some one if you have the phone in a pocket or purse. If the buttons on the front can be pushed the phone will dial randomly so I highly recommend getting a hard case that covers the buttons. Phone came in a nice case and in great shape. This really is a good little phone for the price.,Good
i ordered a white iPhone and got a blue one... so I think that's a little unprofessional but other then that i like it.,Good
"Nice phone, some small issues with it, like it won't send my Amazon notifications no matter what settings I change, but they're just little things like that. The waterproof feature is nice, already had my brother spill beer all over it without any issue. Camera is pretty good quality, I'm satisfied with the picture quality. And it's not too big, I switched from the LG G3 which is little bit bigger and I like the size of this better; it fits nicely in my pocket, even with a case. Overall, very satisfied with the purchase.",Good
I got this phone on thanks giving.Its touch is very good and camera is dam good.Its very good phone.,Good
I love everything about this phone but since it was At&t some features such as bluetooth still don't work. But I knew that goin' in so no biggie. I love the OS platform I think it is far superior. I can use this phone as a mini stereo and it is wonderful.,Good
Excellent delivery although they sent it to the post office. Besides that the nexus 5 is working smooth. Thanks,Good
"Although the phone is falling apart, this tends to be the norm with this brand. It's still working very well.",Good
Really not a bad little phone for the price. I bought is as a spare as my mobile is used for business and I can't afford to be without it. This serves as a spare in case I drop my primary in the toilet. Is it as good as the Samsung 5 or 6? No.. but it's a heck of a lot less cost and it functions pretty well. If you are expecting steak for hamburger money you will be let down. Although it's worth every bit of the asking price on Amazon.,Good
"I am happy with the BlackBerry Classic: love the keyboard and the 'touch' features; the Blackberry Hub makes accessing all messages a breeze; the screen size works for me; with the features and apps I literallyhave a tablet in my hand. However, the charging feature is a serious short-coming: I can only charge this device when it is turned on.",Good
"I just received the Vivid today and set about getting it to work. I didn't want the expensive company sponsoring it so I tried this unlocked one. I had an old cell phone with a SIM card in it, and when I put it into the Vivid and set it up it worked. My old phone number from a cheaper company is in the Vivid. The set up info from the expensive company was not very good but I managed most of it. It also arrived much faster than I expected.",Good
"Good, easy to use and reliable phone...so far. Telephone call audio a shade tinny but who makes calls anymore or is concerned about how anyone sounds? The price is right and the specs should cost you a lot more.",Good
Great product... Love the storage space as well as the accesibility of free apps. I would reccomend this product to other people.,Good
"Strong build, good battery life, cameras are pretty good and the screen is all around great. The only problem is that the performance is a little slow. Not a good phone for gaming. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the phone. 4.5/5",Good
The phone came really fast. I could tell the phone used to have a cracked screen because whoever replaced didn't align the screen & the phone all the way. Overall the phone came in great condition for the price! Occasionally it'll freeze but if I lock & unlock the phone it goes back to working normal again.,Good
"Phone works the perfect the only thing is it doesn't seem to be brand new or was dropped durning shipping because the screen wasn't on completely and had to push it back down to get it attached again. was really surprised a company would send it out like this, i really need the replacement phone so couldn't send it back but so far its been working fine",Good
Amazing phone. Absolutely loved it!Very good interface with gmail accounts when you setup this phone. Overall i would recommend this phone.,Good
Big phone but is very sleek. I came from a Moto X Pure and this is a big larger but it feels smaller because it is thinner.Camera in low light is very good and stock android for sure!,Good
It's a really great gadget. I love it. Just one little that I don't like though. There is no designated icon to access the memory card files without going to video or music. I also can't email documents because of the same problem.,Good
"I bought it for my cousin and he is happy with it. It has all the features he was looking for, so far no complaint.",Good
"Great phone lovely features ,when I turn the phone lenghtways though the videos get distorted",Good
"I bought this as a temporary replacement when my phone was damaged and I had to claim repair using warranty. It was a very good phone, probably a bit expensive, but served its purpose well.",Good
The first phone I got had some issues and would turn on and off repeatedly and duplicate messages. I let the company who sent it to me know and they had a new phone to me within a few days and allowed me to return the first phone after I received the second phone. I have the second phone now and it works great!,Good
"the phone itself looked great. my problem was with the battery which did not charge the phone, because the battery was old, worn, used. the writing was faded on it.",Good
"So far this phone lives up to our expectations. The we ordered the recommended case but it didn't fit. However, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 case fits, the only problem is the earphone jack is slightly of but this is not a problem for us as we won't be using it anyway. My daughter has the Samsung GN2 and this phone is almost as good as hers for less than half the price. The only problem I have with this phone vs the Note 2 is the camera is no quite as good, but that is not a deal breaker. I would have given 5 stars if the camera was better. I recommend it for anyone that wants a good phone but doesn't' t want to pay a house payment for it.",Good
The smartphone is pretty good and the best for the price range!! the camera is awesome!,Good
"So far this has become my daily driver as far as smartphones go.It has great sound, and decent viewing for the price, and the 4g lte has reasonable speeds for me.(Straight Talk)The screen isn't the best in terms of quality, but for the price point is still great, and you can still get a good experience with it.The only downside to this device so far is not having the option to upgrade to Android 4.4, this phone is stuck on 4.3 Until Blu rolls out the update for the device******UPDATE*******After the time I've had with this phone I've found myself going back to my old HTC One X. I cant stand the screen resolution on this device and am no longer wanting to use it.4g LTE- the speeds are not noticeable at all, and most of the time the LTE is worse then my HTC's 3g-(Straight Talk)In all, I've changed my decision for this device, not a good long term phone",Good
"I bought this phone in February (sold by and shipped by Amazon); on opening the box, I noticed that it was a Motorola France unit but aside from having to use an adapter on the charger, there were no issues and I enjoyed using the phone until October. Suddenly the phone kept rebooting every 5 minutes. I checked online and found others with the same issues but no solution. I contacted Motorola(USA)who advised me that this was a French phone and I should contact Motorola France! Well I contacted Amazon instead and they emailed me the same day saying that a new phone was being priority shipped to me and all I had to do was print out their return label which they emailed me and ship the old phone back..it was the most amazing customer service I have come across. If more companies were like this, life would be so much less stressful. It does state no warranty on the product description but this did not stop Amazon from doing the right thing.",Good
"Nice phone, however it was listed on a page that said 32gb. Must have been mistaken?",Good
"specs and battery life are average, how many bars you get depends on service provider. is good but you can do better",Good
"A beautiful white phone complemented by equally amazing pen. Have installed all the apps I wanted and phone is still super fluid. No lag whatsoever.The phone itself sits on the palm firmly, thanks to its curved back.Battery life is insane. The work I do with my phone (check emails, Facebook, whatssap, calls), the battery goes down by 40 to 45% by end of day. My Galaxy S3 on the other hand would go down by 70 to 80%.Improvements:1. Expand the air command to include other functions.2. The switch on pen is of no or little use. It can be expanded to functionality like smart select or screen write by hovering over phone screen rather than touching.",Good
"did not want a smart phone, wouldn't get enough use out of it to justify the costs. when i get more time to learn this one, i know it will do the job.",Good
"All that I was led to believe it would be. And at a price considerably less than the ""new""",Good
"Got it and put it to work, My phone work,s perfect great price toooooo! You will need it if your have a 4 g phone it is a must!",Good
"The iPhone 5 is great. No scratches and everything turned out well. I wish it had a tool where I could open up the SMS card holder/opening. Overall, I love my new phone. I'm just having trouble with Siri.",Good
"Very fast....I got my phones on within 3 days after I ordered it. However, It came with no CD but had instructions on how to activate the phone",Good
"I had purchased my 1st smart phone while my mother was dying out of state and my husband was in skilled nursing and possibly not coming home. My new latest & greatest smart phone was stolen the day after purchase. I wasn't about to pay $600 for a replacement, so bought the Droid. It may not be fancy, but it works great.",Good
It is ok for someone who is just using the basic stuff. It does not handle more than 2 apps. Great sound and video.,Good
"I purchased the Nokia C-300 back in November, 2011. When I first got it, it often froze up and shut off. Got frustrated but after a few days it stopped. Now occasionally it freezes but doesn't bother me as all phones of mine did this (Nokias, that is). It's decent on the internet, and you can do a lot with this phone. I do e-mail and chat. The only other downside is getting pictures messages, which I can't seem to get, but T-mobile won't help me as this phone isn't supported. Another tolerable thing, though. But if you are constant texter: Beware! The keys chip very badly and it's hard to see the numbers/letters. I ended up purchasing another phone for this reason.. but other than that, phone worked fine. Also, the great thing about this phone is the battery life. I am a huge texter and caller and I go 3 days easily without a single charge.",Good
"pros: fast, dual sim, hi res pics, everything you want in a phone.cons: battery life sucks",Good
I thought this is a nice looking phone. The only issue was the camera didn't work properly.,Good
"Awesome LG! It took a few days to get use to the buttons on the back but now I love that design. Camera is ok, nothing crazy good but it suffices for average needs. Good touch response time. Have had no major problems.Sadly, like so many phones, it comes pre-loaded with a bunch of crap apps that I cannot completely remove. Possibly with rooting but I do think I will need a Rooting For Dummies pictorial flowchart. ;-)The rounded screen edge has provided a unique challenge. I am on my 3rd screen protector because it seems so many are designed to reach only to where the screen glass starts it's curve. The last 1/2 cm being open and unprotected is worrisome since the edges usually make the first unplanned contact with the ground. :o",Good
"This phone was exactly what I wanted..... Save the flower design on the front of the phone, which I was not expecting. Runs great and there are but a few minor physical flaws. The phone came completely factory restored with new inner and outer screens. I chose 4 stars because of the flowers, which were not posted anywhere. Otherwise, I love this phone, and I refuse to go back to my smartphone!",Good
This phone is perfect . Took a long time to get to me but when it arrived it was exactly what I ordered .,Good
"I bought this phone due to its rugged specifications. Not that I'm particularly hard on a phone, but I know I'd crack a smartphone or drop it beside my golf cart (did this twice and ran over them).Some have complained about the sound of this phone, but I honestly haven't had that as an issue. The phone works fine for what it is. Keep in mind that it's not going to take great pictures and trying to surf the net is impossible. I don't particularly care. I use a phone to make calls with and I want it to be charged and working when I want it. I've talked longer than an hour on this particular one and the battery barely moved. It's easy to handle...not as loud as I would like on the ringtone, but that's likely just me. Downloading new ringtones was easy. Get it for what it is.",Good
thanks for shipping the phone on such a timely mananer. My only problem with phone it is locked to a specific carrier which does not allow me to put on the black berry service here in montserrat,Good
"An excellent phone for the price, love it. The real management could be be better though. But battery has longevity like a champ.",Good
"Love it, but it gets super hot when you charge the battery , I don't know if it is because is all metallic or what ... but it burns!. Everything else works perfectly ! I'm from Honduras it worked fine with both companies Claro and Tigo",Good
The phone came with everything and it works perfect considering I'm using it in the Caribbean but my only issue was getting faulty earphones,Good
"I bought this phone to replace a Windows Mobile phone that broke when I dropped it. I have had the phone for about a month and so far I have been impressed with the features. Here's the pros and cons in a nutshell.Pros:- Syncs with PC and MS Outlook so I was able to load my contacts and calendar quickly.- Screen is bright and has good resolution.- Light weight and slim- The camera is nice but don't expect it to replace your point an shoot.- Fairly easy to figure out.- Plug and play - I added my T-Mobile sim and was up and running in minutes.Cons:- The manual that came with it is in polish- Not a lot of support for US customers- You have to buy your accessories online.- The head set is not very good- the sync port is unique so you can't use just anyone's cables for it.For the price you can't beat this phone. Touch screen, blue-tooth, speaker, PC Sync, camera, micro SDHC, light and slim.",Good
"I reviewed this phone several times before purchasing and I already knew Samsungs reputation on stellar cell phones yet was still was sketical on a prepaid phone. Wow! was I wrong! This phone does all that my contract phone does and a bit more for lower the price. (I purchased this phone for my wife by the way)With the right plan you get 4G speeds,depending your area and all that android has to offer.I highly recommend this phone for anyone looking to ditch contract prices.I'm about to purchased,if not this phone but another prepaid for my son.Kuddos out to Samsung though.",Good
"It works, but something inside is rattling when shaken, expected better from a ""certified refurbished"" item",Good
"Lost my iPhone and needed a phone that wasn't pre-historic! This phone was fabulous! Gave me an intro into the droids, and honestly, I do miss it. All of the customizations and password locked messages, etc. Any how, the phone arrived in great shape. Battery was good. New cord. I was happy with my purchase and will purchase from again if I'm ever in need of a quick affordable phone.",Good
"The phone itself is good, but when bring it to Philippines, need to activate it, it won't work even you put the sim card. But the item is excellent.",Good
"Camera, speakerphone, alarm clock, stop watch, calendar, calculator or some of nice features as well as teh bright screen on the face of the flip phone when it is closed. Easy access ringer adjusment buttons on sides to turn down or off the ringer.",Good
very good product and the timely arrival original recommend everyone buy the product to enjoy a good piece to wear thanks greetings,Good
"This phone is perfect! Exactly as it is described brand new with the same pen the charger and the quick start guide. Just one problem with me switching it to metro pcs sometimes I have no service and I am not sure how to fix that. But it is nothing against the phone or the seller, this is a great buy and awesome seller and great super fast shipping and phone does come to you ready and unlocked. Just had to pay metro 16.00 in store to switch out my Sim cards.",Good
"this phone is a good alternative if you are not going to used it for work, and used limited amount of e-mail send.",Good
"It's work good but the internal memory is not enough it's impossible to have on it more than 3 application, view on this side even the iphone 3gs is much better. I'm having some difficulties with the back cover. I am a bit disappointed to have this problem from a brand new phone, it's look like a refurbished phone.",Good
my girlfriend had been looking for a phone that she would like that didnt cause her a ton of problems and she loves this phone,Good
"We still have an old grandfathered unlimited data plan with Verizon. Just needed a replacement phone so that we don't have to ""upgrade"" and pay for spikes in data usage. My son has had a Droid 2 for over three years. This one is as good as the first one he had. Good solid reliability.",Good
"Easy to use, good size, clear sound.It doesn't ring as loud as i would likeI would recoment to a friend",Good
I am pleased with this phone. It is working perfectly well. No complaints to date.,Good
"This phone is great. I went to Ecuador for couple of weeks and the cell phone work very well over there. I bought couple of SIM cards from two local carries and I had no problems making phone calls and sending text messages. I was able to connect to my sister's WiFi. Browsing trough the Internet was very fast. I had to update some apps (Whatsup, etc). I couldn't update the app ""Talk"" (now Hangouts) for some reason. The cell takes decent pictures but not like my Samsung Galaxy. People over there have Iphones and Galaxies but they were very impressed with the quality and low price of this phone. I gave it away and I'm planing to buy couple of more for Christmas. If you planning to go out of the country and need an unlock phone, take a look at these Blu cell phones, you'll be happy.",Good
"This was purchased as a gift for someone who is very hard on phones. So far we think it is a good phone. Sound quality is not the best, although he lives in a rural area that does not have the strongest service available, so that could be the problem. He works around a lot of dust, and often his hands are not clean when he uses it, and so far it has stood up to the punishment. Wipes clean, and looks good. He is happy with the camera. Recommended for those who want a basic phone and no frills. This one may just be bullet proof.",Good
"Blackberry funciono perfectamente, se le realizaron pruebas al mismoSe conecta rapido y sus funciones tambienVendedor muy eficiente lo recomiendoGracias",Good
"I recently bought this phone so at the moment I cannot write a comprehensive review as I am still learning about the various features. The one thing that I can write about is the battery. With my previous phone I charged it once per week. However, with my HTC phone I find that I must charge it every day as the battery does not last longer than that. I will update my review once I have become more familiar with the item.",Good
IT IS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT BUT I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE....VERY FAST SHIPPING,Good
ITS V E R Y N I C E CELL PHONE I L I K E D . . T HANKS,Good
"It started off with buying one for my husband. Then I started playing around with his phone and fell in love with it myself. Had to buy a new one for me as well. One thing though, double check that it comes with an adapter for American outlets. My hubby's did, but mine did not.",Good
I got my Niece this blu advance right here and she was very happy with the outcome of it plus the price isn't bad at all,Good
"Everything was great until I realized that the GPS wasn't working properly and no matter what settings I changed, the GPS would rarely lock and when it did, it wouldn't update my location as I drove (which makes using the ""navigation"" option in Google Maps pointless). Luckily I realized this within 30 days of receiving the phone, so USA Wireless let me return it. I received my refund within 2 weeks of them receiving the item.",Good
"Great phone, but volume is not very loud and not much better on speaker, but long stand bye time and talk time, we'll made, just need way more volume",Good
"I ordered a black phone and I got a bright orange instead, what the hell happen anyway the phone works well but I hate the colour.",Good
"I loved the way Nokia designed its first mobile touchscreen phone. The purchase was a gift for my wife secretly. She was impressed when she discovered the multimedia experience and web browsing it has. Of course, the OVI share experience to upload all her photos and receive comments from her friends and family, was what made her happy. This smartphone has everything required for a practical use of email, e-mail account wizards settings are very easily to use, and with the OVI suite you can have it all in one place. Multitask System Symbian 5th Edition is really the strength of this model, which allows to do many things at once. The only detail known is the battery consumption.",Good
"It is a very nice cell phone, I would recommend it to anyone. The only drawback is this is a refurbished unit and has no gorilla glass.",Good
So for so good have not open it yet its Christmas gift .but it looks great,Good
"Doesn't come with correct charging cable, luckily I have a Samsung Galaxy Pro tab that uses the same charger. Poor move on the manufacturer's part.",Good
"I researched this phone extensively before going with it. I have large hands and haven't had issues with the physical size of this device at all. After just a couple weeks, I can't imagine not having all that lovely screen real estate to work with.The performance is snappy, the call quality is very good, the pictures and video are very good for my needs. Add in a 64gb memory card for a roomy hi-def music collection, and you have quite a powerful device that's capable of doing a lot of things very well. I highly recommend it.",Good
"This phone was for a relative of mine to serve as a charging station for the battery in his own Icognito. It's not what would be called a smart phone in terms of it's operating system, but it has served my uncle faithfully for nearly 4 years. The condition described did not match the item itself, but that issue lies with the seller, not the product.",Good
Its good so far nice size too. I just thought that the phone had better camera quality,Good
"Bought this for my wife to replace another BLU phone. As discussed in other reviews the phones have their quirks, random reboots, turning airplane mode on and off to get wifi and data connections to work again, but for the price they are a good alternative to phones that are 3 times the cost.",Good
"it was a good phone, i kwew what i was getting and i did get what i ordered. it does work and the battery works. i only use it about 3 times a week when we go shopping. this way we keep in touch. sounds funny, but it works.",Good
The phone arrived very fast. I like the window interface. It's huge. I can read everything on the screen. I was able to get it set up on the Straighttalk network and I am loving it! I saved on the phone and I save on my phone bill. What more could you ask for? Best purchase I have made in a year.,Good
"Reliable product I must say. Initially, I was skeptical though, as I had to send this phone to India and I was not sure if it will work on non-AT&T sim. However, the product worked pretty well. In terms of product packaging, the phone came in un-tampered packing with everything close to being new except the phone box, no issues for me though. It's been six months and the phone has been working fine. So based on my experience, I will definitely recommend it.",Good
"Well i purchased this phone as a gift. I wanted to send it overseas and since they dont have such phone, its the best deal.Product quality is good. Good for people who text a lot.It was already unlocked.I dont know what else to say, since i did not use it more that few hours.The best part is its very low price, and you can change color of it by changing its back cover!",Good
"The phone is in really good conditions, but I did had some disappointments with this phone. I bought it for my dad and as far as he likes it, it's okay for me. For the money that you pay, it's really good conditions. Thank you",Good
"This thing cost way too much, but it is a great phone. Every thing works, the keyboard is nice (except the keys are a little too flat), the screen, the camera, everything works well.I Have had two problems though - First I bought this phone to use with T-mobile, but it doesn't operate at the frequency T-mobile uses for their 3G service. Second, after the last upgrade it has randomly started playing music. It is a known bug with some work-arounds, but it is very annoying.So, with all the new variants coming out, I'd say look for something newer on contract first. But if there is a price drop (as stock and demand drop) this is a very capable choice.",Good
"Very happy at this price point. There are definitely better phones out there, but this one offers a lot of bang for your buck. It performs well and didn't come with too much bloatware.",Good
I am a bit concerned about the battery I was expecting it to last longer than it does,Good
"Great item and purchase experience. It was received right on time. The item have not presented any problem, it works correctly in Ecuador.",Good
"The phone works great but noticed a few issues. I noticed that the battery sometimes have issue charging, I find I have to clean the ports often to get it to charge properly. If cleaning the ports didn't work i sometimes remove the battery for a few hours. When I turn on the phone the flashlight turns on, the only way to turn it off is by restating the phone. (I haven't installed a flashlight app to help w this issue). The charger says it's a 2.0 amp but it charges slower than my other 2.0 amp chargers. Other then that great phone.",Good
clear sounds easy to access and use speed dialswould like easier access to mp3s for ring toneswould recommend to friends,Good
"I really enjoy the size of the phone and the easy access pen. Definitely a good sturdy phone, just a few issues with the phone. It does get really hot when the brightness is up high and will stain previous screen on your screen if the brightness is high. Other than that functionality of the phone is amazing and i would recommend it as an upgrade",Good
"The phone is as I expected. Fast, nice style and good functionalities. Though one big minor point is that the phone get really hot easily which I didn't expect. So when I use the phone with apps a lot than I for sure cannot use the case I bought with it, cause it makes the phone even hotter. Since the warmth cannot go anywhere.If I knew this I would have look out for another phone with kind of same specs but wont work overload and get that hot. Before this I had a Lenovo S890, it did get hot to but never like this one. Though S890 is of course a old type where the specs are lot different.But overall all the specs is met, it is beter if concentrating (when new models comes out of the lenovo) on the heat management or make the phone in a way it will release the heath.",Good
"This is the best quality phone I have ever treated myself to. It's only drawback is its annoying tendency to unlock itself in my pocket and make appointments and phantom phone calls. Sometimes the touch screen is a little 'quirky' in that it does not pick up my touch accurately. Battery life is great, sound and signal strength are also great. Oh, almost forgot, there is also a quirk that when the Gallery App is running, the shortcut button for the camera does not work. I have to officially stop the Gallery in order for the button to turn the camera on.",Good
"Product was as described. Excellent service. Would recommend.Phone has intermittent problems, and all orifices were full of lint.",Good
"It's a great Android. Good screen size, great resolution and great memory capacity. Plus the dual SIM really helps, specially if you travel frequently.",Good
"The phone does what i need it to do - check email, facebook, etc. However, i believe the memory is lacking because it is very slow loading things. It also takes a while to load web pages even when i have a great connection. The phone did not come with an SD card which was annoying because I could not take pictures. It has a very cool feature that lets you use the phone as a mobile hotspot. Overall I am happy with it, but i would appreciate something a bit faster.",Good
"Very strong design, ideal for teens who begin to use a phone, there will be no problem if you forget to remove the morrol while going home from school and it rains on the way, they are playing and will resist accidental falls, if they are in some dark place and be able to use his flashlight can see donnde tread when walking their programming makes it an excellent product for teenagers.",Good
"I bought this phone last month, and am really enjoying the speed and camera clarity..Jus feeling some uncomfortable on holding 5.5 inch screen and heating issue..",Good
"at first i was really excited about the phone, but when realising how outdated and old of a model it is..it broke my heart. its a new old phone basically",Good
This phone is amazing .. I like the fact it takes decent pics .. and good features which I like .. Its good phone for ah cheap price yall should definitely buy this phone :),Good
"Overall I like this phone. I've had a Nokia 520 GoPhone with AT&T. I've have an Android phone as well, but I prefer the Windows Phone 10 OS. The size of the phone is what I was looking for and I'm very pleased. I like the clear case that came with it. For a lower end phone, the speaker is acceptable. The 8MP camera is a weak, but I'm not a person that takes 100s of photos a week. It's fine for taking pics as reminders and such.",Good
Good phone bought it for my dad and he loves it a bit small for me though I'll be buying more,Good
"the phone is great and as the seller stated. no problems with the company. generally my phone is an improvement to my previous one except for a few things. when playing songs in a playlist there isn't much freedom in choosing which songs i want to play first and then having them all shuffled. also, the playlist repeats itself automatically. i can't choose to have it play one time through or repeat (for the music/playlist part of the phone sony did a terrible job). the earphones that came with the device don't really fit in my ear and the phone doesn't allow other earphones to work with it (ex: apple earphones). i'm unable to sort my contacts into groups for easier access.aside from these small details the phone has been great and i haven't had much problems with it. good seller.",Good
I am very happy with this phone. It was a gift for my son. Just wish there were more directions included .,Good
"Phone was overall great, no noticeable scratches or anything. Amazing for just being a refurbished phone and an amazing price",Good
Good phone for the price. Sturdy and good display. Will recommend to people looking for low end smart phones with features!,Good
My son ordered this phone and really liked it. Unfortunately the keyboard gave out after 10 months and wouldno longer work. It is a good phone but the keyboard does not hold up if you do a lot of texting.,Good
thanks!! for the cell phone works realy good! its one of my best deal! everything its fine looks brand new!!!!,Good
I enjoy using the Env3. I've used it for several years. So far this one seems to be a good phone.,Good
Nice upgrade from my broken flip phone. Price was in my budget and shipping was fast. No complaints.,Good
Received wrong phone the first time but the second time I received the right phone. Still pretty fast for an older phone. Front camera SUCKS!! Other than that no complaints.,Good
"Overall a great phone. GPS is crazy slow to get a signal - works great once established. Keypad is a bit strange. Not sure why it is so recessed. The phone is definitely thick. But makes up for that by how lite it is. Good luck finding a good case for it. Not a lot of good options. I found a good universal case from AT&T for it. No SD card slot. Of course I was aware of that when I purchased it. But it sure would be nice if it had one. The loudspeaker is amazing. There are two loudspeakers in fact. Sound quality is very good. The phone has only locked up on me once. Very stable and responds quickly otherwise. Camera works great. Would be nice if it had a xenon flash vs. the LED flash. But hey, nice that it has one at all. I might suggest to people to look at the N96 instead of this phone. If the N96 is too $$ then this is a fantastic alternative. Good luck!",Good
"Bought as a simple cell phone to accommodate SIM card while traveling in Europe. Needed to have bought a better card for when I transitioned from Romania to Germany, but the phone itself was fine. The only feature I missed on it, from the days when these were the common types of cell phones many of us carried, was predictive typing for text messages. As noted in other reviews, it did come with instructions in Spanish, but I downloaded an English language version off the internet as those reviewers had suggested.",Good
"I like this phone, use it with Straight talk. I do not like the way the text messaging is set up but that's a personal preference. I got mine from Good Guy Electronics. The issue I had was the battery would fully charge but then die without notice when it reached about 50%. I contacted them and the next morning they sent back message saying they would send me a new battery same day so hope that fixes the issue!",Good
"Good phone for those who wish to ""dip their toes"" into the smartphone pond. A little difficult to manuever around the settings for setting up internet access and mms, a little help from my provider had everything working fine. Have tried it with H2O, didn't work to well on mms, but was great for emails. Had better luck with Red Pocket. First phone I've had that can take videos. All in all it's a decent phone. Small and easily portable. My last phone had the slide out keyboard so that was a must.",Good
"great phone, but i would wait for snapdragon 821 processor that's more souped up. and Asus will be first to bring to Market later in yr.",Good
"Great phone! Worked without issue for quite a while, eventually the screen stopped adjusting when I turn it on its side but whatever, it's an old phone at this point. Highly recommended!",Good
"Bought this because my new Samsung Flight II was screwing up and I had one of these 2 years ago. great phone, and with AT&T anyways, you don't have to pay extra for Mobile Email(data rates still apply) like with some of these new phones. Takes great pics, and has a flash. May be ""Old"" but I like it.",Good
"Hello,How can I tell which model I have? The European 900/1800 or the Dual-Band GSM 850/1900? Is there an easy way to tell by looking at the phone?Thanks!",Good
"My first smartphone and I am amazed how powerful it is and how easy it is to use. The phone is from Vietnam, so there are a few problems with dealing with a foreign website. Very nice phone!",Good
its a good phone not a great phone like I thought I like flip phones but this seems a little old and dated.,Good
"Great phone. Still the best all-touch BB10 you can get, probably better than the new Leap. Although its specs are not on par with the latest Android flagships, BB10 is very efficient and this phone is great for communications and media consumption.",Good
"The phone is good. No defects, and seems to be in great shape. Only problem I see is that the wrong charger was sent with the phone. The charger works, but takes a good 10 hours to completely charge the phone. If a factory charger had been sent, it would have changed within 3 hours. That is my only issue with what I received with this product.",Good
"Great phone for the price. After about a month pr two the paint did begin to wear off, and the logo on the back began to fall off. Still an amazing phone, very responsive, and cheap.",Good
"The phone came in a sealed apple box and really does look like new. The only thing which was odd, was that when I checked for Apple warranty online they told me that the warranty was expired and the phone was produced more than 2 years ago. Customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and I was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.Another small thing which is odd: this phone has Chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. Although changing the primary language to English it was not possible to remove Chinese completely as a language. I tried to get around that by installing Spanish as a second language so Chinese is now only third. Nevertheless Chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone.",Good
The phone arrived on time and it worked as expected. Very nice product and service. I'd recommend the article and the vendor.,Good
"I've had this phone for a day andi gotta say I'm surprised of how well this phone works, everything is beautiful and fast, the browser is my only issue, I've had a problem while watching videos on it (I hope its just my Internet)Other than that this phone is one of the best investments I've ever done",Good
"I love to play videogames. This is the reason I bought this cell phone. As cell phone is very good, just as good as other phones, but as a console, it's a little short, especially for its internal memory.",Good
"Nice cool little phone to have with all the right features, I would recommend this phone to someone else if they asked",Good
This item was a great price and with free shipping!!! I recieved this item in time for christmas and it works great. Thank you seller.,Good
Would give it five but there are some issues. Short battery life is really the only complaint. Except with the new update the speakers turned to s***. Full volume sounds distorted and like the speakers are blown out. Other than that I love this phone!,Good
I wish apple would put instructions with their products.I'm relying on my spouse to inform an old fell ow like me.,Good
Thanks but i think ill just stick to my old phone. I do enjoy the games but the phone locked up and i cant get ahold of this france SFR place to fix it. I wont be ordering any more iphones anymore. I do like it its just frozen up and i cant use it atm. Thanks again. I was impressed with the speedy delivery.,Good
Phone works well. ATT refused to acknowledge the IMEI number over the phone had to bring into a store where it had no issues being added to account. 4g network working,Good
I like to a feet back for u guy my samsung galaxy note it perfect event I cant use yet but I know nothing happens when I stard use thank u,Good
The battery last just a day with medium use and sometimes yo have to charge it during day,Good
"I had this phone for like 3 weeks now. Couldn't get it to connect to metropcs, went in the office the guy there said that I will have problems with it. Anyhow I bought the sim card online from metropcs, call the customer service and get it to connect. Since using it is a descent phone got no problem with my carrier like what the guy said in the store.. My only prob was the APN settings.. Great phone for the price. Loving what I am getting from it.. Would recommend it...",Good
"It is okay phone, but does not have 4GB internal memory as promised. Don't let that hype fool ya.",Good
"The phone was in incredible shape, not a scratch on it. Just fyi, the phone is actually a i9020a which is at&t network only so it can't be used on T-Mobile.",Good
"After a few years of using HTC, Samsung, and One Plus phones, I am glad to be back on Blackberry hardware. The phone feels sturdy and the keyboard/track pad makes typing and navigating webpages so much easier.My Android apps transferred easily from one phone to this one through NFC. I'm still getting used to working with Blackberry Hub, but so far so good.One gripe is the battery life. My One Plus would last up to 2 full days of moderate use, but this phone may not make it through on while day without a charge... I'm not sure if this is software related, or if it is because of the fact that this phone runs warm. Either way, I hope Blackberry addresses this issue soon in one of their frequent updates. My old Bold had such amazing battery life, so I believe this is something that Blackberry can fix for a five star review.",Good
Would do 5 stars but every time I am on phone I get 5 to 10 apps opened and or mute or hang up my calls. Should have a better system for those issues. The ear buds w microphone that came with phone didn't work so been using old ones ghat hurt my ears. I emailed Blu about this and have yet to get a response but overall like this phone. It is fast.,Good
Best phone i've had in years. User friendly. Many apps. Easy texting. Large screen. I also like using the stylus. Well done Samsung!,Good
"Wow, I can't say enough good things about this phone. It is fast, good sized dispay, responsive, and great graphics. The design isn't that great though, and it's a pretty plain phone. But it is totally worth the $91 I spent on it. The battery is okay, but not the best. Overall, I love this phone!!",Good
Does everything an S5 is supposed to do. Just does it with multiple carriers at the same time. Great battery management too!,Good
Did not get AT & T service so many of festures did not work. I do like the keyboard and ease of texting.,Good
"A very useful phone, if you are getting used to the windows operating system. Has amazing features for the price",Good
"Exelent phone The zize is confortable for goScreen bright, this phone is thin and lightI dont give five star for The 16 gb of memoryOnly",Good
This is a GREAT product! But it lacks support from Amazon.Good support from RIM (manufacturer) and after two weeks BIS services were working with my current mobile phone operator (Vivo Brazil).,Good
"Comparable to Samsung Galaxy Mega series. Nice phone. More built in memory than Mega which I like. Asus loads as much GARBAGE WARE on it's devices as Sumsung does so rooting is essential to have a really worthwhile android experience. There is so much Asus loaded CRAP on this device that, like Samsung, it is beyond annoying. It is truely enfuriating. Have used for 6 weeks now & am happy with purchase so far. The seller (NPG Store) gets deserved praise for refunding shipping cost due to late arrival. That warrants customer loyalty. 4 stars for product. 5 stars for seller. Mikey",Good
sbueno si funciona ensegida que le coloque la tarjeta sim funciono a la perfeccion. lo unico malo es ala hora de configurar la pagina de inicio de internet. todavia no he podido hacerlo y por esa razon no he podido entrar a las redes sociales,Good
The phone came as the review said. Excellent condition. Normal wear and tear. My father is enjoying it. We did have problems with the Sims card though. You actually have to take it in and get a new Sims card.,Good
Great phone. Got here faster than we expected. It was for son. He dropped. It on his shoe and ended up with a crack on the screen.,Good
"Excelent product for the money. Only that doesn't come with any accesories. No headset, no bluetoth, no nothing, just charger.",Good
"I got this phone for my girlfriend because her other Xperia smartphone died on her after 2 years use. We needed a cheap option and it seemed like a good choice for the price. Overall it's a great phone, little to no slowdown when using several apps, great battery life, NFC, good size for one hand use, decent camera and nice build quality and design.The only downside is the screen. Colors are a bit washed out so everything has a paleish blue hue. It really is a shame because it's a very good phone for every day use and it performs better than what I expected. With a better screen, I would easily give it 5 stars.",Good
"I mainly purchased this as a secondary phone so I could use a few Android apps, which I could not get on my primary phone (Windows). For the price of this phone, I am quite satisfied with the features and capabilities. I was not expecting a lot of storage or power in the first place, so it was sufficient for my light use needs as well as give me the capability to switch out the SIM if I go to other countries. Additionally, having the micro SD slot is critical since this phone only has 8GB. If you are looking for NFC, to play graphic intensive games, or a multitasking fiend, you need to look at buying a more powerful and capable phone. You will not get a flagship phone for this price; many complain about this phone by comparing it phones well beyond ($500+). This phone is also low enough in price that I will use in lieu of my primary phone in certain situations where I may damage or lose a phone.",Good
"Price was very good,nice look and feel. Many apps run just as well as other top phones but at 1/4 the cost. If you buy one order a good screen protector and put it on first thing. Now that I had it a while comparing it to a flagship model isn't fair but how many can you buy for the price of a flagship ? about 4 to 6 depending on which you chose. Add a 2 year warranty and that beat my carriers protection policy hands down.",Good
"I got this phone for Straighttalk and haven't had any issues except sending/downloading pictures, but I'm pretty sure I can get this fixed with tech support. The phone itself was brand new, came with a bunch of cool stuff (European charger, though, so the prongs don't fit in my outlets, but it came with a cord and earphones which makes up for it). The battery life lasts me all day so far, the internet is speedy, and it has not froze or closed apps unexpectedly yet. Had it for about two weeks. Would definitely recommend!",Good
Touch sensitivity was at times too high on some parts of the screen and non-existent on other parts. Rebooting the phone usually fixed the issue. Not a bad phone for the price.,Good
"I was kind of skeptical about buying this phone. After receiving it, I have no major complaints. It isn't a brand new Galaxy or IPhone, just remember that going in. It works fine with a little bit of lag here and there, he camera isn't the greatest, and the paint from the earpiece wore off kind of quick. On he other side, it did everything most normal smart phone would do. I would gladly buy another BLU phone if I needed to. Just remember, this will not work with Verizon. Good product, amaking price.",Good
"I really do like this phone, the only real complaint I have is that the speaker on the ear piece and the loud speaker itself are not nearly as loud as my previous phone but overall a very nice phone.",Good
"In my opinion this phone was the last good non smartphone verizon offered so when mine broke I had to get another one. The only thing is the ""refurbished"" one that i have has a problem with ""s"" key on the keyboard.",Good
"Pros:Arrived in a neat box with all its cables and acessories, and even had an extra wall adapter added. The phone and box were in perfect condition and I ran into no problems setting up and using the phone. The camera on the phone is beautiful. The phone itself is also beautiful and does not feel cheap.Cons:The OS, basically. Make sure you are willing to deal with buggy software and a lack of many different apps you would normally find on an Android or Apple device. But then again, if you are looking for a refreshing change, nothing beats the Metro style. No matter how limited and buggy the OS may be, no one can deny it's beautiful.",Good
Pros* Best Value for money* Looks/Feel* GPS with voice navigation* Music* Outstanding Camera (10/10)* Wifi/Net connections* Slider touch screen + Querty still not heavy and fits in pocket easilyCons* Default memory card only 2 GB* Touch screen is bit sluggish(OK for me)* Default head phones which I recieved are worst,Good
cricket gsm (USA) servises working good.I have a problem with phone auto updating system is not workingim still using for version 4.4.2What can I do?,Good
This phone sounds great and feels great. I wish the text messaging app was better and I don't like the placement of the power button. Those are small issues that I can deal with. The best phone around for $249.,Good
"Arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. There was no user manual (only a ""start up"" leaflet) but I downloaded the fulluser manual for use on my computer. There was also no warranty card included, but I did register the phone on Samsung'sweb site.",Good
"The phone seems to be good so far. I question though if the main switch will not get worn out of over use, since it is used for turning ON and OFF both the phone and the screen. I miss the little circular switch at the bottom that turns the screen ON and OFF on other models.Other than that, I paid extra of second day delivery, but I received the phone 6 days later. The vendor should refund me the extra shipping charge",Good
"This makes a great backup phone for use in international travel. It has dual SIM so I keep one in it for use in the US, and then buy a local SIM card at my overseas destination to keep down costs. This feature (not smart) phone has tremendous battery life which is a great advantage when travelling. It also has a built in radio and LED flashlight, also handy when travelling.It does need additional memory if you want to take pictures or listen to MP3s.The only downside is the the camera is quite poor, and not suitable as replacement for even the most basic point and shoot.",Good
Not much to say that has been said already. One of the best phones I have ever used. The phone is extremely efficient at multi tasking its OK for games when your in a waiting room. Its a really smooth experience. The only problems I have with it are. 1 I wish the screen was brighter in direct sunlight. To be fair no phone I have used ever passed that test though. 2 its half way into 2015 and still no Lollipop not to big of a deal but still. The camera is hit or miss. Somtimes it takes good pictures and sometimes it doesn't. If you fool with it you can get a decent photo but its not convenient like just flicking your wrist and snapping a shot. It should just be fluid as that no fooling around with where your standing because the auto HDR is crap. With those aside this is a great a phone very well made. I will probably get another moto x when the time co!es I really like this phone and what it has to offer so I will be sticking with the X line for awile.,Good
"very happy with it although I wish it came with instructions in English, only came with Chinese one, thanks",Good
"I was very lucky I have this Android phone! Its cheap but, it has competetive performance compare to the high end android phone. I did not have a second thought to buy this gadget!",Good
The phone performs fine and I can install any apps I choose so far.The 1 draw back I've noticed is that it gets quite warm after prolonged use.The camera rear camera takes decent quality pictures at least for what I would use it for. The front camera is a bit grainy it seems but really that doesn't bother me.I upgraded from an old Droid phone so it performs well and above my previous version. The price was the selling point for me I did a lot of reviews against other phones using different sites and the specs vs the price really held up and so far the performance does too.,Good
"Did come GSM unlocked and brand new in the box untouched. Pretty sleek and clear picture taking quality. Im impressed.The back button seems to stick every now and then which is a bit annoying. The buttons do take time to get used to but the placement does come in handy and feels useful after awhile. Speaker volume is louder than a lot of phones!It does come with TMobile apps and such. But works fine with MetroPCS.It does overheat a bit but not hot enough to make holding it hurt, just slightly warm in my experience in the months so far.My phone use changes a lot, and I wish the battery lasted longer at times though but i do enjoy the phone a lot",Good
"Great phone, fast both in performance and in networking. Streams TV via it's cellular connection (T-Mobile) at 15 Mbs, which is plenty for watching Hockey live in HD. Performance is 5 starts all around!So, why not 5 stars? For me this is a little large. Others will probably laugh when they read this but, I used to have a Galaxy S2, and I felt like the size of that was just right. I feel like the decision that the cellular makers have made that the newer the device the bigger the screen is the wrong choice. My S2 fit comfortably in my shirt pocket, the S5 sticks out the top.",Good
"I knew this product would be a little bulky and heavy due to the nature of it. But it has been great. the only thing I noticed is that my ZAGG protection that I had prior to putting this one has created bubbles in the new screen. The plug in is a little hard to open sometimes, but worth it.",Good
"I love the phone. My only disappointment is that I thought it was an AT&T unlocked phone. I am using it on Straight Talk. It is a T-Mobile phone. My coverage as a result of that sucks bad in my area. It is no fault of the seller or the phone, just wanted you to be aware incase you plan on using Straight Talk in a area that T-Mobile coverage sucks bc it will use the T-Mobile towers.",Good
"I am totally satisfied with the S3 mini. However, the manual that came with it is in every language but ENGLISH....I despise going on-line and downloading a pdf. If you never used this phone or do not have a computer, you are left out in the dark. Samsung can afford to send an in-depth manual...I highly recommend the phone, but the tightwads at Samsung need to get it together..... 5 star for the phone, 3 star for customer consideration...",Good
"This is a great little phone. Weighs under 2 oz on my postal scale. One star off for the recessed charging port that others have mentioned (had to take a utility knife to the case). Going back to Kitkat is a bit weird, but everything works great. I got this as a second phone to take running without weighing me down. Switching sim cards takes a bit, but not too bad. Too small for me to use as an everyday phone. Would buy this brand again. All in all a great deal.",Good
Wish it was a bit larger. Still trying to figure out all the features since this is the first smart phone I have ever owned. I do like it a lot though and it works much better than my older cellphone.,Good
This phone works like a tablet.. Has adequaTe space too. I love it... thhis lg is my galaxy and iphone in one. It workz just as good. The only fault is that sometimes when am using facebook or google the phone comes of the app and go back to home screen. This annoys me ....,Good
"Phone is unlocked but not fully, had to pay extra $20 to get it fully unlocked, that is nothing for the price I paid for the phone. Phone comes with all the necessary accessories except for microsd card. You need to switch the network to GSM for the phone to work on a GSM NETWORK!!!. Overall I am happy with my purchase.",Good
"I received my Sidekick new and it came sooner than expected, I was very pleased with that. It works great, looks cool, love how the screen swings out and the price was very reasonable! This phone is perfect to simply call and text which is what I was looking for. I don't like the fact that it doesn't alert you when you get a message or your contact names don't appear in the inbox but besides that the phone is great! =)",Good
I received my phone but the charger is for internanationl I need a charger for us how can I get one I only. Need the plug in part. Order num is 1059333. Item num is 2A-5s5n-oj5m its for the samsung s4 mini Thank,Good
"A good phone for the cost, I recommend it for users of average consumption low equipment requirements. With respect to the battery is durable than 24hrs for a few more hours duration.",Good
I am very happy with it. It did however come with a few marks on the back but the front was good to,Good
This phone is great! In almost new condition! really is indestructible! Bought this for my dad and he loves it! better price than verizon was going to give me!,Good
"I bought for my daughter and she loves it. We have have no problems just, BLU doesn't have covers for most of there phones so I was able to find a cover at the mall.",Good
"Awesome phone, sound is great for music, pictures are great.. it doesn't do screenshots, I had to download a separate app. The case that comes with it is OK.. the sticky strip that is in it sucks. It didn't last 2days... overall great phone for the price. Oh, I LOVE the front flash and best quality is the best.",Good
"Love this phone. It's the right color and it did came unlocked, wich i was kind of worried because of some people's comments. The only bad thing its that the charger adapter came in in the uk version and in my country (Venezuela) we can't use it, that's why i gave it 4 stars.",Good
"Good Phone, still trying to figure out why the phone apps opens (just make it ready to dial in) as default after it comes from screen saving mode; I have to constantly put them out of the way; still learning how some features work and how much I can do with it. Hardware quality looks very good so far, although the power adapter appears stiff and hard to plug in for charging (maybe a matting tolerance should improve).",Good
"Excellent product, charm me the phone, just that the time was too. I had to wait about four months to receive the product.",Good
"Bought this phone for my 16 year old. She loves it. She says it is a little laggy sometimes when playing games, but other than that, the phone has been pretty perfect for her!!",Good
"Verizon is making me pay $10 for a data plan for this phone for email, which is BS. But besides that everything worked great when I got the phone. A few weeks later the screen wouldn't work at all while i was making a phone call. So i couldn't check my voicemails or call any business that had you select numbers for options. That was a HUGE let down but I made due using my SO's phone for all of that. But last week I dropped my phone in the toilet. The battery didn't get wet at all because of my case so I just stuck it in some rice for a day. When I turned my phone back on the screen started working during calls again! So all worked out well.",Good
"I didn't give the 5 stars because when i opend it, the screen has a little mark on the top, like someone had use it before. But it wors perfectly!",Good
"Having lost my old smart phone (and htc Vivid), I was really bummed to have to buy a new phone, but even going to a used version of the Exhilarate I was pleased. The battery life on this phone is STELLAR, lasting a whole day and a half even with fairly heavy use of the GPS app, my 4G connection, and video.It has a front-facing camera, a lot of Samsung's built-in apps can be disabled so as not to cramp your style if you're a bloatware hater like me, and the call quality and connection quality are excellent! Skype comes in loud and clear on this bad boy!I highly recommend this phone. It only got a 4 star because I wish the camera was a higher megapixelage (though what it's got now works fine) and that it had more internal memory (I like to keep files for work).Buy it. You'll thank me later.",Good
Only cons is that it doesn't allow a memory card. But the cell phone is excellent,Good
"The biggest disappointment to me is the screen. I understand that Samsung needed to reduce the size in order to shrink the phone's footprint, but it dialed the resolution back to 2011. The rest of the hardware looks good and functions well. Voice calls are generally good, signal performance was adequate, and battery life delivers a day's worth of use.The software is nearly as advanced as the full-sized phone, but nixes some of the features for reasons unknown. For example, Smart Stay and Smart Scroll are gone, but you can still use Face Unlock. The TouchWiz user interface is as flexible (and complex) as ever. The camera offers plenty of neat features, but loses the GS4's most exciting capture modes. Thank goodness the Mini takes good pictures. Media options are plentiful, even though the GS4 Mini doesn't have the best screen on which to watch movies.To wrap-up its for what you get: a smaller, more user-friendly handset that isn't quite the flagship it pretends to be.",Good
"Purchased this on April 28th 2014. Has good specs and excellent camera. Today, June 13th, 2016 the screen cracked and the phone is worthless now. I'm sad, two years is such a short life for a phone. I had a case on it as well. I have left this as a 4 star review because I do think it was a good phone (outside of it being so fragile.",Good
"The camera quality is great which is an asset for me when purchasing a new phone. User interface is excellent and the phone very elegantly designed. It comes with a screen protector already on plus an extra. There's also a pair of earphones included in the box which gives good sound quality.Pros: great camera 8mp, easy to use and understand, lots of cool features eg. Guest modeCons: sound quality is great but too low. The phone is not very loud when ringing or playing music. I would give it 5 stars if the phone was louder",Good
"Purchased as a gift for my 14 year old, who loves it. Only draw back is there no cases for it, but it comes with a clear case.",Good
Great watch for the price bluetooth app isn't very good but i put my sim card in and it worked great! Also i havent figured out how to use the browser yet each time i load google.com it says connection failed.,Good
"The case works wonderfully in protecting my phone. The only complaint I have is that it has been a hot summer and if I use the phone outside and sweat at all, moisture gets under the plastic front cover where the Touch ID button isand i have to take it apart and dry it out before I can use the phone. The moisture acts like a barrier between the plastic and screen and you can't even hang up. If there was a way to keep it dry I would give it a 10 star.",Good
Its keeps dropping my calls but its ok otherwise. I'm not not sorry i purchased this Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime,Good
"This is one tough case. Be prepared the tablet by itself is light but with this on case, it will bulk up the weight. The snap-off front cover converts to a stand which is helpful so you don't have to hold the tablet. I commute on a motorcycle and wanted something to help guard by tablet from some summer liquid sunshine (rain) as well as the occational accidental drop (from when the kids borrow the tab cause I would never drop my tab....).",Good
"great battery life, but speed is a little slow, I like the 6"" screen. Resolution is more than good enough. The power button is in a bad place.. when holding you can turn it off accidentally. Mono recording is blah... I love the beautiful and panoramic selfie at 5MP. Photo cameras are just as good as any other phone.",Good
I had a little feedback on the phones that I ship to members of the family and this phone was very very good they loved it no bad complain Thanks,Good
"I'm an experienced Android user, and so far the phone is working pretty well. We'll see how long it lasts after the first full month of use. The features on this phone are nice, the screen is simple and the phone is thin and light. Plenty of space for music, photos, and videos. Added with an SD card, it holds a lot. I don't normally care for touch screen keyboards but I'll make an exception for this one. Tipping the phone sideways lengthens the keyboard and makes texting easier. The web browsing is excellent, very clear and allows full page exploration. Comes with the Android Gingerbread system, which is nice. Its fast and has a lot of nifty features. Overall, excellent phone.",Good
i bought this for my friend as gift and he really liked it.. its a old model of galaxy but still work good.thanks..,Good
"the cellphone its ok, but I dont know why I can upgrade the OS (OS version is 4.2.2 jelly bean). A few days after I bought the same cellphone to a relative and this got OS 5.0.1 Lollipop. I dont know why mine came with jelly bean 4.2.2 and its impossible to upgrade it. I wanna get that upgrade. Please let me know how to do it.",Good
"I think the phone is good for the senior citizen that I purchased it for. The only complaint I have is the instructions said to put the battery in, which I did not see and I could not remove the back to check it. I was finally told by my son-in-law that the battery was already in and was the type of phone that did not get a replacement battery but the phone would need replacing. I was annoyed that there was nothing included that explained this.",Good
"I really love this phone. Works perfectly the way I anticipated. The only downside is that, it gets hot in just some few minutes of usage.",Good
"I purchased this unlocked dual sim phone and live in california. Although i only used it for a week now, i have to say i am pleased.Pros: lightweight, jellybean, 8MP camera, camera is good with the right lighting also front facing camera is good, overrall good mid range android device, 720p video recording but maxes out at 30fps, internal memory 1.8 GB (good enough to hold all your basic apps and a few midrange quality games).Cons: soft keys have no backlight and impossible to see at night but easy to adjust to, internal memory kind of low, slightly sluggish performance during gameplay/all round usage, also the led flash is not so brilliant.Verdict: a good alternative for beginner/moderate android user. Its not a high end phone, middle ranged phone but i am happy. This is a really good phone for the price.",Good
"Just received the phone, and there is no converter included for non-U.S. outlets, though it is pictured in the product information. Nor is there a packing list, either online or with the product. And (ironically) there seems to be no way to make a phone call to inquire, so let the buyer beware. If you are buying this for use abroad, get yourself a converter.",Good
"I love this, very nice design, excellent battery life. .but the only down side I have is the phone support only three languages, english-spanish-portugue....I will love to have French",Good
This was cost effective and if fulfill the need I had for an android phone. Unlike any other I checked this phone does what I need and well. Had to change the battery to the extended with hard cover to be better functioning.,Good
"The unlock button came with a little problem, it has to be pressed really hard in order to unlock the phone, but aside from that it's allright",Good
"Great phone for the price, nice camera and it runs smooth (with only 1 gb ram)",Good
"Great device, bought it for my mom and it works without a hitch. The camera isn't so great though, it's difficult to focus the camera and to take a shot without blur.",Good
"Despite being my first experience, I can say it was excellent, very good team, all arrived in good condition, fast and efficient operation.",Good
"Great deal on a past generation phone with a great camera and space for internet and memory storage.Deals quite well with fcbk and other apps.Tends to freeze when u used it to ""fast""",Good
This phone is fast it's not even a phone it's instant but a it's over priced b when I ordered it it got lost in shipping and took a extra day because the package got lost b the charger even with the adapter will not work in the US and I'm not satisfied with the battery life and no aftermarket charging cases available,Good
It is great but I didn't get satisfied when I could download some apps therefore I have to look for a newer version.,Good
This phone is well worth the purchase if you like big phones. Not too big and not too small. 4 stars because it only upgrades and high as the Kitkat build when there is Lollipop and Marshmallow but it STILL performs greatly.,Good
The phone itself was dusty inside the box. The phone was unscratched and we were able to get it activated after buying an activation package. It runs a but slower than expected which is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars.,Good
"The phone is great, was in better condition that I thought it would be. Only thing that I didn't like was that the phone was not entirely clean, still had previous owners information such as still signed in to google account, etc.",Good
This was purchased as a gift to another. So I am unable to give any further comments at this point of time. when I get a feed back I will convey the same to youMohamed,Good
"Getting worn and having sort of fraying on the edged and a little tricky to get off if you need to pop the battery out for a restart but all in all I like. Adds a little heft but i like it, phone was too easy to drop before. Hides the giant cracks across the screen a little bit (from before had case, so I can't judge if it would prevent cracks).",Good
Coming from a LG G2 this has been a very nice upgrade. It has meet my expectations +.,Good
Only giving 4 stars because I've not really had a chance to use the phone other than using it for WiFi. So far it's a good phone for the price.,Good
"Overall a very good quality of refurbished cell phone, it does work well for my daughter in Montreal, Canada. The only thing that I have a concern the battery was not charging quickly, do not know if it is at the lifetime limit!",Good
"I would recommend this phone for anyone needing a replacement. Good quality and price, but not enough storage space for apps. Take into consideration a micro sd card for more storage.",Good
